Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 This section describes Barclays significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specific note, the applicable accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained within the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays PLC Group or the Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
Accounting policies Barclays prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Groups significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control.
The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following: 1 power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights: 2 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 36. ii Foreign currency translation The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
The Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the closing rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation or on partial disposal of the operation.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.
262 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued iii Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, the impairment of financial assets, and hedge accounting.
Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract, which is the trade date or the settlement date.
Classification and measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and may be held at fair value or amortised cost depending on the Groups intention toward the assets and the nature of the assets and liabilities, mainly determined by their contractual terms.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 18.
Derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Groups exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.
iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument.
If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.
New and amended standards and interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except where new standards and amendments to IFRS effective as of 1 January 2014 have resulted in changes in accounting policy.
The only new amended standard that had a material impact on Barclays accounting policies was IAS 32, Amendments to Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which clarified the circumstances in which netting is permitted, in particular what constitutes a currently legally enforceable right of set-off and the circumstances in which gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement.
The effect of the adoption of these new or amended standards on the Groups financial position, performance and cash flows is disclosed on page 339.
All relevant comparatives have been revised to reflect these changes.
Future accounting developments There have been and are expected to be a number of significant changes to the Groups financial reporting after 2014 as a result of amended or new accounting standards that have been or will be issued by the IASB.
The most significant of these are as follows: In 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments which will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
It will lead to significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments.
The key changes relate to: Financial assets: Financial assets will be held at either fair value or amortised cost, except for equity investments not held for trading and certain debt instruments, which may be held at fair value through other comprehensive income: Financial liabilities: Gains and losses arising from changes in own credit on non-derivative financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss will be excluded from the income statement and instead taken to other comprehensive income: Impairment: Credit losses expected at the balance sheet date rather than only losses incurred in the year on loans, debt securities and loan commitments not held at fair value through profit or loss will be reflected in impairment allowances: and Hedge accounting: Hedge accounting will be more closely aligned with financial risk management.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 263 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Significant accounting policies continued Adoption is not mandatory until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard has not been endorsed by the EU.
At this stage, it is not possible to determine the potential financial impacts of adoption on the Group.
In 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
It applies to all contracts with customers except leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts.
The standard will establish a more systematic approach for revenue measurement and recognition.
Adoption is not mandatory until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact.
In addition, the IASB has indicated that it will issue a new standard on accounting for leases.
Under the proposals, lessees would be required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet.
The IASB also plans to issue a new standard on insurance contracts.
The Group will consider the financial impacts of these new standards as they are finalised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Page Page Credit impairment charges and other provisions 268 Fair value of financial instruments 280 Income taxes 271 Provisions 303 Available for sale assets 279 Retirement benefit obligations 323 7.
Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, and to reduce duplication, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk management section as follows: Segmental reporting on pages 229 to 242: Credit risk management, on pages 128 and 129, including exposures to selected countries: Market risk, on pages 130 and 131: Funding risk capital, on pages 132 and 133: and Funding risk liquidity, on page 134.
These are covered by the Audit opinion included on pages 247 to 253.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Performance return The notes included in this section focus on the results and performance of the Group.
Information on the income generated, expenditure incurred, segmental performance, tax, earnings per share and dividends are included here.
2 Segmental reporting Presentation of segmental reporting The Groups segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, and has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Office.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
The Groups activities have been resegmented into Core and Non-Core business units as part of the Group strategy update announced in May 2014.
Comparatives have also been updated.
The Core business consists of Personal & Corporate Banking PCB, Barclaycard, Africa Banking, Investment Bank and Head Office.
Barclays Non-Core BNC groups together businesses and assets that are no longer strategically attractive to Barclays.
An analysis of the Groups performance by business segment and income by geographic segment is included on pages 229 and 230.
Further details on each of the new segments are provided on pages 231 to 242.
3 Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expense The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, available for sale debt investments, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Due to the large number of product types both assets and liabilities, in the normal course of business there are no individual estimates that are material to the results or financial position.
Other interest income principally includes interest income relating to reverse repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Similarly, other interest expense principally includes interest expense relating to repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Included in net interest income is hedge ineffectiveness as detailed on page 278. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 265 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 3 Net interest income continued 2014 Net interest income increased by 4% to 12,080m driven by improvements in PCB savings margins and volume growth in Barclaycard, partially offset by a reduction in Africa Banking due to currency movements and the sale and run-down of assets in BNC.
Interest income decreased by 5% to 17,363m driven by a reduction in income from loans and advances to customers which fell 6% to 14,677m.
Interest expense reduced 21% to 5,283m, driven by a reduction in interest on customer accounts of 1,183m to 1,473m.
2013 Net interest income declined by 1% to 11,600m with lower net interest income in BNC, Head Office and Africa Banking offset by increases in Barclaycard, PCB, and the Investment Bank.
Interest income decreased by 5% to 18,315m driven by a reduction in income from loans and advances to customers which fell 5% to 15,613m.
Interest expense reduced 11% to 6,715m, driven by a reduction in interest on debt securities in issue of 745m to 2,176m due to lower average balances and lower yields.
4 Net fee and commission income Accounting for net fee and commission income The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
2014 2013 2012 m m m Fee and commission income Banking, investment management and credit related fees and commissions 9,681 10,311 10,037 Foreign exchange commission 155 168 176 Fee and commission income 9,836 10,479 10,213 Fee and commission expense 1,662 1,748 1,677 Net fee and commission income 8,174 8,731 8,536 2014 Net fee and commission income decreased 557m to 8,174m.
This was driven by lower fees as a result of decreased debt underwriting fees and declines in cash commissions reflecting lower volumes in the Investment Bank.
Further decreases were caused by the launch of the revised PCB overdraft proposition, which recognises the majority of the overdraft income as net interest income as opposed to fee income, and adverse currency movements in Africa Banking.
These movements were partly offset by increases in Barclaycard driven by growth in payment volumes.
2013 Net fee and commission income remained stable with a 195m increase to 8,731m.
Higher fees as a result of increased volumes within Barclaycard Business Payment and US portfolios, and growth in equity underwriting activity and a strong equity capital market deal calendar, were offset by lower commissions mainly from syndicate and advisory business following concerns about potential slowing down of quantitative easing and the impact of adverse currency movements in Africa Banking.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 5 Net trading income Accounting for net trading income In accordance with IAS 39, trading positions are held at fair value, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.
Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Own credit gains losses arise from the fair valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
See Note 17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2014 2013 2012 m m m Trading income 3,297 6,773 7,926 Own credit gains losses 34 220 4,579 Net trading income 3,331 6,553 3,347 Included within net trading income were losses of 1,051m 2013: 914m gain: 2012: 656m gain on financial assets designated at fair value and losses of 65m 2013: 684m loss: 2012: 3,980m loss on financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2014 Net trading income decreased 49% to 3,331m, primarily reflecting a 2,666m decrease in trading income, as lower volatility and subdued trading activity combined with tighter spreads reduced income across a number of businesses.
Disposals and running down of certain BNC businesses and the 935m fair value reduction on the ESHLA portfolio see Note 18 for further details also contributed to the lower income.
This was partially offset by a 254m favourable variance in own credit gains losses.
2013 Net trading income increased 96% to 6,553m, primarily reflecting a 4,359m variance in own credit 2013: 220m charge: 2012: 4,579m charge as a result of improved credit spreads on Barclays issued debt.
This was offset partially by a 1,153m decrease in underlying trading income, reflecting market uncertainty around central banks tapering of quantitative easing programmes across a number of product areas.
6 Net investment income Accounting for net investment income Dividends are recognised when the right to receive the dividend has been established.
Other accounting policies relating to net investment income are set out in Note 16 Available for sale financial assets and Note 14 Financial assets designated at fair value.
2014 2013 2012 m m m Net gain from disposal of available for sale investments 620 145 452 Dividend income 9 14 42 Net gain from financial instruments designated at fair value 233 203 233 Other investment income 466 318 117 Net investment income 1,328 680 844 2014 Net investment income increased by 648m to 1,328m.
This was largely driven by an increase in disposals of available for sale investments due to favourable market conditions and increases in other investment income as a result of greater certainty regarding the recoverability of certain assets not yet received from the 2008 US Lehman acquisition 2014: 461m gain: 2013: 259m gain.
2013 Net investment income decreased by 164m to 680m.
This was largely driven by lower gains on disposal of available for sale investments partially offset by increases in other investment income as a result of greater certainty regarding the recoverability of certain assets not yet received from the 2008 US Lehman acquisition.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 267 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions Accounting for the impairment of financial assets Loans and other assets held at amortised cost In accordance with IAS 39, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets or available for sale financial investments debt or equity will not be recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets.
These events include: Becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider: It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: and Observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Groups internal processes and all recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in the AFS reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in the AFS reserve is removed from reserves and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
268 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 7 Credit impairment charges and other provisions continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The calculation of impairment involves the use of judgement, based on the Groups experience of managing credit risk.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
These statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears and historical information on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is 1,892m 2013: 2,161m: 2012: 2,075m and amounts to 86% 2013: 71%: 2012: 63% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
For individually significant assets, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account for example, the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculation of future cash flows.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is 312m 2013: 901m: 2012: 1,228m and amounts to 14% 2013: 29%: 2012: 37% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
Further information on impairment allowances and related credit information is set out within the Risk review.
2014 2013 2012 m m m New and increased impairment allowances 3,230 3,929 4,447 Releases 809 683 928 Recoveries 221 201 212 Impairment charges on loans and advances 2,200 3,045 3,307 Provision charges releases for undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees provided 4 17 4 Loan impairment 2,204 3,062 3,303 Available for sale investment 31 1 40 Reverse repurchase agreements 5 8 3 Credit impairment charges and other provisions 2,168 3,071 3,340 More information on the impairment assessment and the measurement of credit losses is included on pages 115 to 118 in Barclays PLC 2014 Pillar 3 report.
The movements on the impairment allowance is shown on page 173.
2014 Loan impairment fell 28% to 2,204m, reflecting lower impairment in BNC, PCB, and Africa Banking partially offset by higher charges in Barclaycard.
2013 Loan impairment fell 7% to 3,062m, reflecting lower impairment in Africa Banking and BNC, partially offset by higher charges in Barclaycard.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 269 Notes to the financial statements Performance return 8 Operating expenses Accounting for staff costs The Group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.
Short-term employee benefits salaries, accrued performance costs and social security are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate.
Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the services.
Deferred cash bonus awards and deferred share bonus awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the vesting period.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period, typically three years from the grant date.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share bonus awards is recognised is based upon the common understanding between the employee and the Group and the terms and conditions of the award.
The Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest as this is the period over which the employees understand that they must provide service in order to receive awards.
The table on page 85 details the relevant award dates, payment dates and the period in which the income statement charge arises for bonuses.
No expense has been recognised in 2014 for the deferred bonuses that will be granted in March 2015, as they are dependent upon future performance rather than performance during 2014.
The accounting policies for share based payments, and pensions and other post retirement benefits are included in Note 34 and Note 35 respectively.

2014 Operating expenses have reduced by 7% to 20,429m, primarily driven by savings from Transform programmes, including a 5% reduction in headcount and currency movements, lower charges for PPI and interest rate hedging, reduced IT and infrastructure spend and non-occurrence of various provisions raised last year.
This was partially offset by the charge of 1,250m 2013: nil for ongoing investigations and litigation relating to Foreign Exchange.
The impact of the Transform cost reduction programmes have driven savings across infrastructure and administration costs.
Staff costs have decreased by 9% to 11,005m reflecting a 5% net reduction in headcount and reductions in incentive awards granted.
2013 Operating expenses have increased 5% to 21,972m.
This was driven by increased staff costs, increased infrastructure costs due to the Transform programme, increased consultancy, legal and professional costs to meet new regulatory requirements such as the Dodd-Frank Act and CRD IV, an increase in the UK bank levy reflecting the increased rate and an increase in impairment in relation to premises restructuring in Europe.
Within other administration and general expenses, increases in provisions for litigation and regulatory penalties were offset by the non-recurrence of the 290m penalty incurred in 2012 arising from the industry-wide investigation into the setting of inter-bank offered rates.

Please refer to Note 45 Non-current assets held for disposal and associated liabilities.
10 Tax Accounting for income taxes Barclays applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits Current Tax is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

The effective tax rate increased due to an increase in non-deductible expenses, including the provision for ongoing investigations and litigation relating to Foreign Exchange, and the non-recurrence of a credit of 337m resulting from settlements with non-UK tax authorities in 2013.
These were partially offset by a change in the jurisdictional mix of profits, a reduction in non-creditable taxes in 2014 and the non-recurrence of a 440m write down of the Spanish deferred tax asset which increased the rate in 2013.
The adjustments in respect of prior years are not considered to be indicative of future trends.

Under US tax rules losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years.
The losses first arose in 2007 and therefore any unused amounts may begin to expire in 2028.
The remaining balances relate primarily to temporary differences for which there is no time limit on recovery.
The US Branch deferred tax asset is stated net of a measurement for UK tax because Barclays Bank PLC is subject to UK tax on the profits of its non-UK branches.
The BGUS tax losses are projected to be fully utilised in 2016 and the US Branch losses in 2018.
A 20% reduction in forecast profits of either BGUS or the US Branch would not extend the recovery period.
UK tax group deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in the UK tax group of 461m 2013: 1,171m includes 245m 2013: 499m relating to tax losses and tax credits.
Tax losses and tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely in the UK.
The remaining balance relates to other temporary differences.
Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the temporary differences, losses and tax credits will be utilised.
Spanish tax group deferred tax asset The reduction to 54m 2013: 353m reflects a reclassification of deferred tax assets relating to the Spanish business which was held for sale.
The remaining deferred tax assets relate to retained businesses and are not dependent on future profitability.
Other deferred tax assets The deferred tax asset of 436m 2013: 472m in other entities within the Group includes 243m 2013: 157m relating to tax losses carried forward.
Of the deferred tax asset of 436m 2013: 472m, an amount of 140m 2013: 114m relates to entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year.
Recognition is based on profit forecasts which indicate that it is probable that the entities will have future taxable profits against which the losses and temporary differences can be utilised.

The amounts are different from those disclosed on the balance sheet as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1,123m 2013: 916m.
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is 4,845m 2013: 4,943m.

Unrecognised deferred tax Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of 2,332m 2013: 1,096m, gross tax losses of 9,764m 2013: 10,897m which includes capital losses of 3,522m 2013: 3,465m, and unused tax credits of 405m 2013: 245m.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to determine the amount of income taxes that would be payable were such temporary differences to reverse.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain and cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group has a number of open tax returns with various tax authorities with whom we are in active dialogue.
Liabilities relating to these open and judgemental matters are based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
These risks are managed in accordance with the Groups Tax Risk Framework.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Further detail on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided on page 272 in the deferred tax assets and liabilities section of this tax note.

When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 296m 2013: 360m shares.
In addition, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the dilutive impact of the potential conversion of outstanding options held in respect of Barclays Africa Group Limited.
The decrease in the number of potential ordinary shares is due to the average share price of 2.39 2013: 2.73 being greater than the average strike price of 2.15 2013: 2.60 on the 666m 2013: 756m outstanding options granted under employee share schemes.

Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2014, 24m 2013: 16m were anti-dilutive.
The 2,021m increase in the basic weighted average number of shares to 16,329m is due to the rights issue in October 2013 and shares issued under employee share schemes and the scrip dividend programme.
The rights issue in October 2013 resulted in the issue of an additional 3,219m shares.

On 31 December 2014, there were 16,498m ordinary shares in issue.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 does not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2015.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 275 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 15 Derivative financial instruments Accounting for derivatives Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Groups net interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
This includes terms included in a contract or other financial asset or liability the host, which, had it been a stand-alone contract, would have had met the definition of a derivative.
These are separated from the host and accounted for in the same way as a derivative.
Hedge accounting The Group applies hedge accounting to represent, to the maximum possible extent permitted under accounting standards, the economic effects of its interest and currency risk management strategies.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Groups investment in the operation.

Approximately $0.8bn 0.5bn of this amount has been recognised, as an available for sale asset.
As discussed in Note 29, Barclays entitlement to these assets is the subject of legal proceedings between the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. and Barclays.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 279 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values The Group applies IAS 39.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition and, depending on the classification of the asset or liability, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available, and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract, and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data, such as spreads on Barclays issued bonds or credit default swaps.
Most market parameters are either directly observable or are implied from instrument prices.
The model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as interpolation when input values do not directly correspond to the most actively traded market trade parameters.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
The best evidence of an instruments fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price.
However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.
For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction: or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to reasonably possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 289.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs Level 3 assets and liabilities.
This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.
Valuation IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market.
Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.

This portfolio primarily consists of long dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors.
The loans have been categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy since 2013 due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation.
Valuation uncertainty arises from the long dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads.
A revised valuation methodology was adopted as at 31 December 2014 which builds an additional component into the loan spreads used in discounting the portfolios expected cash flows, incorporating information on external parties and the factors they may take into account when valuing these assets.
The prior approach was to discount cash flows using a credit-adjusted LIBOR rate.
The spread component that has been added to this discount rate incorporates funding rates, the level of comparable assets such as gilts both current and recent historical levels and other factors.
The change is also consistent with recent industry moves in derivative valuations away from LIBOR-based discounting.
Refinements will be made to the approach to the extent that further market evidence is obtained.
The impact of the change was an income statement charge and corresponding fair value reduction in the loan portfolio of 935m.
The change has no impact on CET 1 capital, which is based on the CRR prudent valuation and reflects a more conservative cost of funding.
Note a Other includes assets and liabilities held for sale of 15,574m 2013: 495m and 13,115m 2013: nil respectively, which are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Assets and liabilities move between Level 2 and Level 3 primarily due to i an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input: or ii a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.
During 2014, transfers into Level 3 totalled 431m 2013: 15,024m.
This was primarily due to: 676m of government and government sponsored debt held as trading portfolio assets following a decrease in observable market activity for UK Gilt strips: 204m in fund and fund linked products held as trading portfolio assets: 346 m of government and government sponsored debt held as trading portfolio liabilities: and 108 m of certificates of deposit, commercial paper and other money market instruments which are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
Transfers out of Level 3 totalled 155m 2013: 606m.
This was primarily due to: 215m of private equity investments held as financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss: 89m of non-asset backed loans held as trading portfolio assets: and 166 m of equity derivatives as a result of more observable valuation inputs.

The gains relating to interest rate curves are offset by a trading loss recognised on the Level 2 derivative instruments that hedge the ESHLA loan portfolio interest rate risk.
Trading income of 466m on trading portfolio assets and net derivative financial instruments of 238 m was driven by the effects of the decrease in interest rate forward curves, with Level 3 assets and liabilities increasing over the period.
Other income of 572m on available for sale assets was driven by foreign exchange fluctuations and a 461m valuation gain on the US Lehman acquisition assets.
Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.
The valuation techniques used for the material products within Levels 2 and 3, and observability and sensitivity analysis for products within Level 3 are described below.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 285 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Interest rate derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices.
This category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Valuation: Interest rate derivative cash flows are valued using interest rate yield curves whereby observable market data is used to construct the term structure of forward rates.
This is then used to project and discount future cash flows based on the parameters of the trade.
Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market observable inputs.
Exotic interest rate derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models based on observable and unobservable market parameter inputs.
Input parameters include interest rates, volatilities, correlations and others as appropriate.
Where unobservable, a parameter will be set with reference to an observable proxy.
Inflation forward curves and interest rate yield curves are extrapolated beyond observable tenors.
Balance guaranteed swaps are valued using cash flow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying asset performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities, and third party pricing sources.
Prepayment is projected based on observing historic prepayment rates.
Observability: In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying.
Certain correlation, convexity, long dated forwards and volatility exposures are unobservable beyond liquid maturities.
Unobservable model inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services where available, otherwise stress scenarios or historic data are used.
Foreign exchange derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to the foreign exchange FX market.
This category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
The vast majority are traded as OTC derivatives.
Valuation: Exotic and non-exotic derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models.
Input parameters include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Observability: Certain correlations, long dated forwards and volatilities are unobservable beyond liquid maturities.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is primarily based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Credit derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes single name and index Credit Default Swaps CDS, asset backed CDS, synthetic Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs, and Nth-to-default basket swaps.
Valuation: CDS are valued using a market standard model that incorporates the credit curve as its principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Where credit spreads are unobservable, they are determined with reference to recent transactions or proxied from bond spreads on observable trades of the same issuer or other similar entities.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that calculates fair value based on credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates, and is calibrated to the index tranche market.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are not actively traded are considered unobservable.
The correlation input to synthetic CDO valuation is considered unobservable as it is proxied from the observable index tranche market.
Where an asset backed credit derivative does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a model, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of valuations of the illiquid CDS portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each spread curve.
The shift is based on the average range of pricing observed in the market for similar CDS.
Synthetic CDO sensitivity is calculated using correlation levels derived from the range of contributors to a consensus bespoke service.
Commodity derivatives Description: These products are exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, power and natural gas.
Valuation: The valuations of commodity swaps and options are determined using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products or by applying extrapolation techniques from the observable market.
Observability: Certain correlations, forward curves and volatilities for longer dated exposures are unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over two years.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
Equity derivatives Description: These are derivatives linked to equity indices and single names.
This category includes exchange traded and OTC equity derivatives including vanilla and exotic options.
Valuation: The valuations of OTC equity derivatives are determined using industry standard models.
Input parameters include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repo curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Unobservable model inputs are determined by reference to liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Observability: In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is estimated based on the dispersion of consensus data services either directly or through proxies.
Derivative exposure to monoline insurers Description: These products are derivatives through which credit protection has been purchased on structured debt instruments primarily collateralised loan obligations or CLOs from monoline insurers.
Valuation: Given the bespoke nature of the CDS, the primary valuation input is the price of the cash instrument it protects.
Observability: While the market value of the cash instrument underlying the CDS contract may be observable, its use in the valuation of CDS is considered unobservable due to the bespoke nature of the monoline CDS contracts.
Level 3 sensitivity: Due to the high degree of uncertainty, the sensitivity reflects the impact of writing down the credit protection element of fair value to zero.
Government and government sponsored debt Description: These are government bonds, supra sovereign bonds and agency bonds.
Valuation: Liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the closing levels observed in these markets.
Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Where there are no observable market prices, fair value is determined by reference to either issuances or CDS spreads of the same issuer as proxy inputs to obtain discounted cash flow amounts.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, the bond is considered Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is calculated by using the range of observable proxy prices.
Corporate debt Description: This primarily contains corporate bonds.
Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
In the absence of observable bond or CDS spreads for the respective issuer, similar reference assets or sector averages are applied as a proxy the appropriateness of proxies being assessed based on issuer, coupon, maturity and industry.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, the security is considered Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for the corporate bonds portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying position driven by average ranges of external levels observed in the market for similar bonds.
Non-asset backed loans Description: This category is largely made up of fixed rate loans, such as the ESHLA portfolio, which are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows.
Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that calculate fair value based on observable interest rates and unobservable loan spreads.
Unobservable loan spreads incorporate funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.
Observability: Within this population, the unobservable input is the loan spread.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a shift to loan spreads.
Asset backed securities Description: These are securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, CLOs and other asset backed securities.
Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics, and loan attributes such as loan-to-value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price, and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on externally sourced pricing dispersion, defined at the position level.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 287 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Commercial real estate loans Description: This portfolio includes loans that are secured by a range of commercial property types including retail, hotel, office, multi-family and industrial properties.
Valuation: Performing loans are valued using discounted cash flow analysis which considers the characteristics of the loan such as property type, geographic location, credit quality and property performance reviews in order to determine an appropriate credit spread.
Where there is significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, valuation is based on independent third party appraisals or bids for the underlying properties.
Independent third party appraisals are determined by discounted cash flow analysis.
The key valuation inputs are yield and loss given default.
Observability: Since each commercial real estate loan is unique in nature, and the secondary loan market is relatively illiquid, valuation inputs are generally considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: For performing loans, sensitivity is determined by stressing the credit spread for each loan.
For loans which have significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, sensitivity is determined by either a range of bids or by stressing the inputs to independent third party appraisals.
Issued debt Description: This category contains Barclays issued notes.
Valuation: Fair valued Barclays issued notes are valued using discounted cash flow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various observable input parameters depending on the terms of the instrument.
Observability: Barclays issued notes are generally observable.
Structured notes are debt instruments containing embedded derivatives.
Where either an input to the embedded derivative or the debt instrument is deemed unobservable and significant to the overall valuation of the note, the structured note is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity to the unobservable input in the embedded derivative is calculated in line with the method used for the derivative instrument concerned and incorporated within the derivative lines.
Private equity investments Description: This category includes private equity investments.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
This requires the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis, and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed comparative companies.
Full valuations are generally performed at least biannually, with the positions reviewed periodically for material events that might impact upon fair value.
The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature.
However, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Observability: Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Level 3 sensitivity: The relevant valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is estimated by flexing such assumptions to reasonable alternative levels and determining the impact on the resulting valuation.
Other Description: The US Lehman acquisition assets are included within Other.
For more details, refer to Note 29.
Other also includes investment property and non-current assets held for sale.
See below for more details.
Level 3 sensitivity: No stress has been applied to the receivables relating to the Lehman acquisition Note 29.
The sensitivity inherent in the measurement of the receivables is akin to a litigation provision.
Due to this, an upside and downside stress on a basis comparable with the other assets cannot be applied.
Investment property Description: Investment property consists of commercial real estate property including most of the major property types: retail, office, industrial and multi-family properties.
Valuation: Investment property is valued using competitive asset specific market bids.
When bids are unavailable, valuations are determined by independent third party appraisers through a discounted cash flow analysis.
The key inputs to the discounted cash flow valuation are capitalisation rates, yields, growth rate, and loss given default.
Observability: Since each investment property is unique in nature and the commercial real estate market is illiquid, valuation inputs are largely unobservable.
Non-current assets held for sale Description: Non-current assets held for sale materially consists of the Spanish business, which includes all assets and liabilities of Barclays Bank S. A. U. and its subsidiaries being offered for sale.
Valuation: Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less cost to sell.
The Spanish business has been recognised at the agreed price less costs to sell.
Observability: There is no liquid market for such transactions and therefore valuation inputs are largely unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The Spanish business is valued at the agreed price less costs to sell and is not expected to display significant sensitivity.
288 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Complex derivative instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes significantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussion with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered when determining Barclays fair value estimates.

The increase in favourable change and corresponding decrease in unfavourable change for non-asset backed loans between 2014 and 2013 has resulted from the fair value methodology change described on page 281, which moved the fair valuation for the ESHLA portfolio towards the middle of the range of potential outcomes.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs.
Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.
Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of those interrelationships is included below.
Comparable price Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable observable bond, then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the unobservable bond.
The adjustment to yield or spread should account for relevant differences in the bonds such as maturity or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and bond being valued in order to establish the value of the bond.
In general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the holder of a cash instrument.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in an input derived from a comparable price in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Conditional prepayment rate Conditional prepayment rate is the proportion of voluntary, unscheduled repayments of loan principal by a borrower.
Prepayment rates affect the weighted average life of securities by altering the timing of future projected cash flows.
A significant increase in a conditional prepayment rate in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Conditional prepayment rates are typically inversely correlated to credit spread i. e. securities with high borrower credit spread typically experience lower prepayment rates, and also tend to experience higher default rates.
Constant default rate The constant default rate represents an annualised rate of default of the loan principal by the borrower.
A significant increase in a constant default rate in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Constant default rate and conditional prepayment rates are typically inversely correlated: fewer defaults on loans typically will mean higher credit quality and therefore more prepayments.
Correlation Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables i. e. how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable.
Correlation is a key input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument.
For example, where an option contract is written on a basket of underlying names, the volatility of the basket, and hence the fair value of the option, will depend on the correlation between the basket components.
Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a collateralised debt obligation structure.
A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Credit spread Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a cash asset.
For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a movement in fair value that is favourable or unfavourable depending on the specific terms of the instrument.
Loan spread Loan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate.
Loan spreads typically reflect funding costs, credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.
In general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a loan.
Forwards A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.
A forward is generally based on the spot price or rate, adjusted for the cost of carry, and defines the price or rate that will be used to deliver a currency, bond, commodity or some other underlying instrument at a point in the future.
A forward may also refer to the rate fixed for a future financial obligation, such as the interest rate on a loan payment.
In general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the contracted receiver of the underlying currency, bond, commodity, etc.
but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
Loss given default LGD Loss given default represents the expected loss upon liquidation of the collateral as a percentage of the balance outstanding.
In general, a significant increase in the LGD in isolation will translate to lower recovery and lower projected cash flows to pay to the securitisation, resulting in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of the securitised product.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 291 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Net Asset Value Net asset value represents the total value of a funds assets and liabilities.
In general, a significant increase in net asset value in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for a fund.
Volatility Volatility is a key input in the valuation of derivative products containing optionality.
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying.
It represents an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
In general, volatilities will be implied from observed option prices.
For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, as well as reflecting the given strike maturity profile of a specific option contract.
In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is favourable for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.
There may be inter-relationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs that can be implied from observation e. g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise but these are specific to individual markets and may vary over time.
Yield The rate used to discount projected cash flows in a discounted future cash flow analysis.
In general, a significant increase in yield in isolation will result in a movement in fair value that is unfavourable for the holder of a cash instrument.
Fair value adjustments Key balance sheet valuation adjustments are quantified below: 2014 2013 m m Bid-offer valuation adjustments 396 406 Other exit adjustments 169 208 Uncollateralised derivative funding 100 67 Derivative credit valuation adjustments: Monolines 24 62 Other derivative credit valuation adjustments 394 322 Derivative debit valuation adjustments 177 310 Bid-offer valuation adjustments The Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets.
For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the price for the expected close out strategy.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data.
Other exit adjustments Market data input for exotic derivatives may not have a directly observable bid-offer spread.
In such instances, an exit adjustment is applied as a proxy for the bid-offer adjustment.
An example of this is correlation risk where an adjustment is applied to reflect the possible range of values that market participants apply.
The exit adjustment may be determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario analysis or historical analysis.
The other exit adjustments have reduced by 39m to 169m respectively as a result of movements in market bid-offer spreads.
Discounting approaches for derivative instruments Collateralised In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant Credit Support Annex CSA.
This CSA-aware discounting approach recognises the cheapest to deliver option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.
Uncollateralised A fair value adjustment of 100m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received.
This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment FFVA.
FFVA has increased by 33m to 100m mainly as a result of interest rates decreasing, causing uncollateralised exposures to increase.
FFVA is determined by calculating the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and applying a funding rate to these exposures that reflects the market cost of funding.
Barclays internal Treasury lending rates are used as an input to the calculation.
The approach takes into account the probability of default of each counterparty, as well as any mandatory break clauses.
The FFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels.
On calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments CVA and Debit Valuation Adjustments DVA are retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels.
The effect of incorporating this scaling factor at 31 December 2014 was to reduce the FFVA by 300m 2013: 200m.
292 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Uncollateralised derivative trading activity is used to determine this scaling factor.
The trading history analysed includes new trades, terminations, trade restructures and novations.
The FFVA balance and movement is driven by the Barclays own cost of funding spread over LIBOR, counterparty default probabilities and recovery rates, as well as the market value of the underlying derivatives.
Movements in the market value of the portfolio in scope for FFVA are mainly driven by interest rates, inflation rates and foreign exchange levels.
Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.
The above approach has been in use since 2012 with no significant changes.
Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments Credit valuation adjustments CVAs and debit valuation adjustments DVAs are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are modelled for OTC derivatives across all asset classes.
Calculations are derived from estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, on a counterparty basis.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, monolines, sovereigns and sovereign agencies, supranationals, and special-purpose vehicles.
Exposure at default for CVA and DVA is generally based on expected exposure, estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors.
For some complex products, where this approach is not feasible, simplifying assumptions are made, either through proxying with a more vanilla structure, or using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.
Where strong collateralisation agreement exists as a mitigant to counterparty risk, the exposure is set to zero.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
For counterparties where this information is not available, or considered unreliable due to the nature of the exposure, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 120m 2013: 105m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors may lead to a systematic bias in the valuation of counterparty credit risk, termed wrong-way or right-way risk.
This is not incorporated into the CVA calculation, but risk of wrong-way exposure is controlled at the trade origination stage.
Derivative credit valuation adjustments increased by 34m to 418m primarily due to an increase in exposure as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by a reduction in monoline exposure.
Derivative debit valuation adjustments have reduced by 133m to 177m primarily as a result of improvements in Barclays credit.
Portfolio exemptions The Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities.
Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position i. e. an asset for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position i. e. a liability for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions.
Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is 96m 2013: 137m.
There are no additions 2013: 53m and 41m 2013: 64m of amortisation and releases.
The reserve held for unrecognised gains is predominantly related to derivative financial instruments.
Third party credit enhancements Structured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays Group are insured up to $250,000 per depositor, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC in the United States.
The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage.
The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement.
The on balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to 3,650m 2013: 3,136m.
Valuation control framework The valuation control framework covers fair value positions and is a key control in ensuring the material accuracy of valuations.
The valuation control function within Finance is responsible for independent price verification, oversight of prudent and fair value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
Governance over the valuation process is the responsibility of the Valuation Committee, and this is the governance forum to which valuation issues are escalated.
The Valuation Committee meets on a monthly basis and is responsible for overseeing valuation policy and practice within the Group.
It provides reports to the Board Audit Committee, which examines the judgements taken on valuation and related disclosures.
Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market.
The characteristics against which the data source is assessed are independence, reliability, consistency with other sources and evidence that the data represents an executable price.
The most current data available at balance sheet date is used.
Where significant variances are noted in the independent price verification process, an adjustment is made to fair value.
Additional fair value adjustments may be made to reflect such factors as bid-offer spreads, market data uncertainty, model limitations and counterparty risk further detail on these fair value adjustments is disclosed on page 292. barclays.

294 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Financial assets The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost including loans and advances to banks and customers, and other lending such as reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy noted on pages 297 and 298.
Loans and advances to banks The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.
There is minimal difference between the fair value and carrying amount due to the short term nature of the lending i. e. predominantly overnight deposits and the high credit quality of counterparties.
Loans and advances to customers The fair value of loans and advances to customers, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality.
For retail lending i. e. Home loans and Credit cards tailored discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair value of different product types.
For example, for home loans different models are used to estimate fair values of tracker, offset and fixed rate mortgage products.
Key inputs to these models are the differentials between historic and current product margins and estimated prepayment rates.
The discount of fair value to carrying amount for home loans has reduced to 4.4% 2013: 5.0% due to changes in product mix across the loan portfolio and movements in product margins.
The fair value of Corporate loans is calculated by the use of discounted cash flow techniques where the gross loan values are discounted at a rate of difference between contractual margins and hurdle rates or spreads where Barclays charges a margin over LIBOR depending on credit quality and loss given default and years to maturity.
The discount between the carrying and fair value has decreased to 1.5% 2013: 2.1%.
Reverse repurchase agreements The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.
Financial liabilities The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost including customer accounts and other deposits such as repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on pages 298 and 315.
Deposits from banks and customer accounts In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that re-price frequently such as customer accounts and other deposits and short term debt securities.
The fair value for deposits with longer term maturities such as time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Consequently the fair value discount is minimal.
Debt securities in issue Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.
The fair value difference has increased to 1.7% 2013: 0.4%.
Repurchase agreements The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.
Subordinated liabilities Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issue concerned or issues with similar terms and conditions.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 295 Notes to the financial statements Assets and liabilities held at fair value 19 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on: All financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet: and All derivative financial instruments and reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing agreements that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements, but do not qualify for balance sheet netting.

Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing The Financial instruments column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set off under netting agreements, such as global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transaction covered by the agreements if an event of default or other predetermined events occur.
Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.
These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by the Group are further explained in the Credit risk mitigation section on page 129.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Financial instruments held at amortised cost The notes included in this section focus on assets that are held at amortised cost arising from the Groups retail and wholesale lending including loans and advances, finance leases, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and similar secured lending.
Detail regarding the Groups capital and liquidity position can be found on pages 184 to 208.
20 Loans and advances to banks and customers Accounting for financial instruments held at amortised cost Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
That is, the initial fair value which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability.
In accordance with IAS 39, where the Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held-for-trading classification and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the definition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.
2014 2013 As at 31 December m m Gross loans and advances to banks 42,111 39,432 Less: allowance for impairment 10 Loans and advances to banks 42,111 39,422 Gross loans and advances to customers 433,222 441,485 Less: allowance for impairment 5,455 7,248 Loans and advances to customers 427,767 434,237 Further information on the Groups loans and advances to banks and customers and impairment allowances are included on pages 142 to 173.
Prior to 2010 the Group reclassified certain financial assets, originally classified as held for trading, that were deemed to be not held-for-trading purposes to loans and advances.
The carrying value and fair value of securities reclassified into loans and advances is 1,862m 2013: 2,812m and 1,834m 2013: 2,727m respectively.
If the reclassifications had not been made, the Groups income statements for 2014 would have included a net gain on the reclassified trading assets of 57m 2013: gain of 57m.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 297 Notes to the financial statements Financial instruments held at amortised cost 21 Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee.
Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.
Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances to customers.
The Group specialises in asset-based lending and works with a broad range of international technology, industrial equipment and commercial companies to provide customised finance programmes to assist manufacturers, dealers and distributors of assets.

Finance lease liabilities The Group leases items of property, plant and equipment on terms that meet the definition of finance leases.
Finance lease liabilities are included within Note 26 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities.
As at 31 December 2014, the total future minimum payments under finance leases were 14m 2013: 19m, of which 5m 2013: 5m was due within one year.
The carrying amount of assets held under finance leases was 31m 2013: 16m.
22 Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing Reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing or similar transaction are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future.
Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing The Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost.
The Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Non-current assets and other investments The notes included in this section focus on the Groups non-current tangible and intangible assets and property plant and equipment, which provide long-term future economic benefits.
23 Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in the enhancement to the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20% Where leasehold property has a remaining useful life of less than 17 years, costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the remaining life of the lease.
Investment property The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.
Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in the income statement.

Impairment of 61m 2013: 86m was charged including 38m in respect of premises relating to restructuring in Europe.
The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.
Refer to Note 18 Fair value of assets and liabilities for further details.
24 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGUs fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets include brands, customer lists, internally generated software, other software, licences and other contracts and core deposit intangibles.
They are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.
Intangible assets are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally over 12 months-25 years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 24 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to business operations according to business segments as follows: 2014 2013 m m Personal and Corporate Banking 3,471 3,471 Africa Banking 915 948 Barclaycard 427 381 Barclays Non-Core 74 78 Total net book value of goodwill 4,887 4,878 Goodwill Testing goodwill for impairment involves a significant amount of estimation.
This includes the identification of independent cash generating units and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisation.
Cash flow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity, and the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash flows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit requires the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances and judgement.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimate of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
Impairment testing of goodwill During 2014, the Group recognised an impairment charge of nil 2013: 79m.
The impairment charge of 79m recognised in 2013 related to goodwill attributable to businesses acquired by Personal and Corporate Banking which was not supportable based on value in use calculations.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 1,126m 2013: 1,091m was allocated to multiple cash-generating units which are not considered individually significant.
Personal and Corporate Banking PCB Goodwill relating to Woolwich was 3,130m 2013: 3,130m of the total PCB balance.
The carrying value of the cash generating unit CGU is determined using an allocation of total group shareholder funds excluding goodwill based on the CGUs share of risk weighted assets before goodwill balances are added back.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 2.4% 2013: 2.1% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.0% 2013: 11.8%.
Based on these assumptions, the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 17,260m 2013: 8,628m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 2,888m 2013: 1,757m whilst a one percentage point change in the terminal growth rate would impact the recoverable amount by 2,070m 2013: 1,210m.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 2,697m 2013: 1,795m.
Africa Goodwill relating to the Absa Retail Bank CGU was 631m 2013: 657m of the total Africa balance.
The carrying value of the CGU has been determined by using net asset value.
The recoverable amount of Absa Retail Bank has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five year period, with a terminal growth rate of 6% 2013: 6% applied thereafter.
The a forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 18.7% 2013: 18.8%.
The recoverable amount calculated based on value in use a exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 1,623m 2013: 1,424m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the a a terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 329m 2013: 291m and 206m 2013: 182m respectively.
A a reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 440m 2013: 385m.
Note a The 2013 comparatives have been restated to reflect the use of pre-tax cost of equity.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 301 Notes to the financial statements Non-current assets and other investments 25 Operating leases Accounting for operating leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases, for operating leases.
An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Group holds the leased assets on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease receivables The Group acts as lessor, whereby items of plant and equipment are purchased and then leased to third parties under arrangements qualifying as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases was 1m 2013: 3m.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.
There are no contingent rents payable.
Operating lease rentals of 594m 2013: 645m have been included in administration and general expenses.
The future minimum lease payments by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2014 2013 Property Equipment Property Equipment m m m m Not more than one year 403 41 567 34 Over one year but not more than five years 1,147 106 1,220 124 Over five years 2,036 2,441 8 Total 3,586 147 4,228 166 Total future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases was 99m 2013: 108m.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings The notes included in this section focus on the Groups accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
26 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities Accounting for insurance contracts The Group applies IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to its insurance contracts.
An insurance contract is a contract that compensates a third party against a loss from non-financial risk.
Some wealth management and other products, such as life assurance contracts, combine investment and insurance features: these are treated as insurance contracts when they pay benefits that are at least 5% more than they would pay if the insured event does not occur.
Insurance liabilities include current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling, and administration costs in respect of claims.
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities.
Where a deficiency is highlighted by the tests, insurance liabilities are increased with any deficiency being recognised in the income statement.
Insurance premium revenue is recognised in the income statement in the period earned, net of reinsurance premiums payable, in net premiums from insurance contracts.
Increases and decreases in insurance liabilities are recognised in the income statement in net claims and benefits on insurance contracts.
2014 2013 m m Accruals and deferred income 4,770 5,179 Other creditors 3,851 4,937 Obligations under finance leases see Note 21 36 19 Insurance contract liabilities, including unit-linked liabilities 2,766 2,799 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities 11,423 12,934 Insurance liabilities relate principally to the Groups long-term business.
Insurance contract liabilities associated with the Groups short-term non-life business are 157m 2013: 108m.
The maximum amounts payable under all of the Groups insurance products, ignoring the probability of insured events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies, were 82bn 2013: 78bn or 74bn 2013: 75bn after reinsurance.
Of this insured risk, 69bn 2013: 65bn or 66bn 2013: 63bn after reinsurances was concentrated in short-term insurance contracts in Africa.
The impact to the income statement and equity under a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the insurance liabilities would be 8m 2013: 7m.
27 Provisions Accounting for provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists: for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
The measurement of provisions often involves significant judgement and therefore constitutes one of the Groups critical accounting estimates.

The additions of 152m mainly relate to leases on properties that have been vacated in the Investment Bank and PCB during the year.
Redundancy and restructuring These provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists.
Additions made during the year relate to formal restructuring plans and have either been utilised, or reversed, where total costs are now expected to be lower than the original provision amount.
Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees Provisions are made if it is probable that a facility will be drawn and the resulting asset is expected to have a realisable value that is less than the amount advanced.
The decrease in these provisions is primarily due to the Spanish business being classified as a disposal group held for sale.
Customer redress Customer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of our business activities.
Customer redress largely relates to Payment Protection Insurance and interest rate hedging products but also includes, within Other customer redress, smaller provisions across the retail and corporate businesses which are likely to be utilised within the next 18 months.
Sundry provisions This category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Payment Protection Insurance Redress As at 31 December 2014 Barclays had recognised cumulative provisions totalling 5,220m against the cost of Payment Protection Insurance PPI redress and associated processing costs with utilisation of 4,161m leaving a residual provision of 1,059m.
Through to 31 December 2014, 1.3m 2013: 1.0m customer initiated claims had been received and processed.
The volume of claims received in 2014 declined 14% compared to 2013 and 62% since the peak in May 2012.
This rate of decline however was slower than previously expected, with increased levels of claims from Claims Management Companies in particular.
Barclays are committed to delivering the right customer outcomes and as such re-review cases to ensure all cases are consistently treated in line with current policy.
During 2014 half of all relevant cases have been re-reviewed.
As a result of the lower than expected decline in claims and the outcome of re-review activity, additional provisions totalling 1,270m have been recognised during 2014.
The provision is calculated using a number of key assumptions which continue to involve significant management judgement and modelling: Customer initiated claim volumes claims received but not yet processed and an estimate of future claims initiated by customers where the volume is anticipated to decline over time Proactive response rate volume of claims in response to proactive mailing Uphold rate the percentage of claims that are upheld as being valid upon review Average claim redress the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims based on the type and age of the policy policies.
These assumptions remain subjective, in particular due to the uncertainty associated with future claims levels, which include complaints driven by CMC activity.
The current provision represents Barclays revised best estimate of all future expected costs of PPI redress, however, it is possible that the eventual outcome may differ from the current estimate.
If this were to be material, the provision would be increased or decreased accordingly.
The current forecast indicates that the large majority of costs included in the provision will be incurred during 2015 and 2016.
The following table details, by key assumption, actual data through to 31 December 2014, forecast assumptions used in the provision calculation and a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact on the provision if the future expected assumptions prove too high or too low.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 27 Provisions continued Interest Rate Hedging Product Redress In 2012, a number of UK banks, including Barclays, agreed with the FSA that they would conduct a review and redress exercise in respect of interest rate hedging products sold on or after 1 December 2001 to retail clients or private customers categorised as being non-sophisticated.
Barclays has raised cumulative provisions totalling 1,500m for the related costs.
As at 31 December 2014, 1,129m of this cumulative provision had been utilised for redress and administrative costs and 160m released, leaving a residual provision of 211m.
During 2014 the utilisation for redress and administrative costs was 798m.
160m was released in Q314 as the review is now substantially complete with redress outcomes, approved by the skilled person, communicated to nearly all of the non-sophisticated customers covered by the review.
Approximately 85% of the customers covered by the review have now been paid all redress due or are not due redress.
The Group expects the remaining provision of 211m at 31 December 2014 to be sufficient to cover the cost of completing redress.
The timing of remaining payments will depend on customer acceptances and response times but the Group expects to have substantially completed redress payments during 2015.
No provision has been recognised in relation to claims from customers categorised as sophisticated, which are not covered by the redress exercise, or incremental consequential loss claims over and above 8% per annum simple interest and an allowance for tax rate differentials from customers categorised as non-sophisticated.
As at 31 December 2014, no significant incremental consequential loss claims from customers categorised as non-sophisticated had been agreed.
These items will be monitored and future provisions will be recognised to the extent an obligation resulting in a probable outflow is identified.
Legal, competition and regulatory matters The Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US.
For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties please see Note 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters.
28 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting for contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on balance sheet: 2014 2013 m m Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 14,547 15,226 Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 6,777 5,958 Contingent liabilities 21,324 21,184 Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 1,091 780 Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements 13,856 19,936 Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 276,315 254,855 The Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Compensation Scheme the FSCS is the UKs Government-backed compensation scheme for customers of authorised institutions that are unable to pay claims.
It provides compensation to depositors in the event that UK licensed deposit-taking institutions are unable to meet their claims.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS, funded by loan facilities totalling approximately 18bn provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The interest rate chargeable on the loan and levied to the industry is subject to a floor equal to the HM Treasurys own cost of borrowing, based on the relevant gilt rate FSCS advises financial institutions to apply the 2024 UK Gilt rate published by the Debt Management Office to the Bradford & Bingley portion of the loan.
The majority of the facility is expected to be recovered, with the exception of an estimated shortfall of 1bn, which the FSCS is recovering by levying the industry in three instalments across 2013, 2014 and 2015.
In 2014, the Accounting Standard Board issued IFRIC 21 Levies, which clarified that the obligating event which gives rise to the liability to be the start of the FSCS scheme year 1 April, i. e. 1 April 2015 for the 2015 16 scheme year.
As a result the liability at December 2014 has been reduced.
The FSCS liability for 2015 16 is to be recognised in 2015.
Barclays has recognised an accrual of 88m as at 31 December 2014 in other liabilities 2013: 148m in respect of the Barclays portion of the total levies raised by the FSCS.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 305 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters Barclays PLC BPLC, Barclays Bank PLC BBPLC and the Group face legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control.
The extent of the impact on BPLC, BBPLC and the Group of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects.
Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.
The Group has not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so.
Investigations into certain agreements The Financial Conduct Authority FCA has alleged that BPLC and BBPLC breached their disclosure obligations in connection with two advisory services agreements entered into by BBPLC.
The FCA has imposed a 50m fine.
BPLC and BBPLC are contesting the findings.
The United Kingdom UK Serious Fraud Office SFO is also investigating these agreements.
The US Department of Justice DOJ and US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC are investigating whether the Groups relationships with third parties who help it to win or retain business are compliant with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
BBPLC has been providing information to other regulators concerning certain of these relationships.
Background Information The FCA has investigated certain agreements, including two advisory services agreements entered into by BBPLC with Qatar Holding LLC Qatar Holding in June and October 2008 respectively, and whether these may have related to BPLCs capital raisings in June and November 2008.
The FCA issued warning notices Warning Notices against BPLC and BBPLC in September 2013.
The existence of the advisory services agreement entered into in June 2008 was disclosed but the entry into the advisory services agreement in October 2008 and the fees payable under both agreements, which amount to a total of 322m payable over a period of five years, were not disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the capital raisings in June and November 2008.
While the Warning Notices consider that BPLC and BBPLC believed at the time that there should be at least some unspecified and undetermined value to be derived from the agreements, they state that the primary purpose of the agreements was not to obtain advisory services but to make additional payments, which would not be disclosed, for the Qatari participation in the capital raisings.
The Warning Notices conclude that BPLC and BBPLC were in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules and BPLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3 the requirement to act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of the Companys shares.
In this regard, the FCA considers that BPLC and BBPLC acted recklessly.
The financial penalty in the Warning Notices against the Group is 50m.
BPLC and BBPLC continue to contest the findings.
Other Investigations The FCA has agreed that the FCA enforcement process be temporarily stayed pending progress in the SFOs investigation into the agreements referred to above, including the advisory services agreements, in respect of which the Group has received and has continued to respond to requests for further information.
The DOJ and SEC are investigating these same agreements and are also undertaking an investigation into whether the Groups relationships with third parties who assist BPLC to win or retain business are compliant with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The US Federal Reserve has requested to be kept informed.
One third-party relationship is also being investigated by another regulator.
Regulators in other jurisdictions have also been briefed on the investigations into the Groups relationships with third parties.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the actions described on the Group or what effect, if any, that they might have upon the Groups operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period.
Alternative Trading Systems and High-Frequency Trading The SEC, the New York State Attorney General NYAG and regulators in certain other jurisdictions have been investigating a range of issues associated with alternative trading systems ATSs, including dark pools, and the activities of high-frequency traders.
The Group has been providing information to the relevant regulatory authorities in response to their enquiries.
Various parties, including the NYAG, have filed complaints against the Group and certain of its current and former officers in connection with ATS related activities.
The Group continues to defend itself against these actions.
Recent Developments Civil complaints have been filed in the New York Federal Court on behalf of a putative class of plaintiffs against BPLC and others generally alleging that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by participating in a scheme in which high-frequency trading firms were given informational and other advantages so that they could manipulate the US securities market to the plaintiffs detriment.
In June 2014, the NYAG filed a complaint Complaint against BPLC and Barclays Capital Inc. BCI in the Supreme Court of the State of New York NY Supreme Court alleging, amongst other things, that BPLC and BCI engaged in fraud and deceptive practices in connection with LX Liquidity Cross, the Groups SEC-registered ATS.
Barclays filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in July 2014.
The NYAG filed an amended complaint Amended Complaint on 3 February 2015 in response to Barclays motion to dismiss.
On 13 February 2015, the NY Supreme Court granted in part and denied in part Barclays motion to dismiss.
Barclays will file a motion to dismiss any remaining claims asserted by the NYAG in the Amended Complaint.
Proceedings in this matter are continuing.
Barclays has also been named in a class action by an institutional investor client under California law based on allegations similar to those in the Complaint.
This California class action has been consolidated with the class action filed in the New York Federal Court described above.
Also, following the filing of the Complaint, Barclays was named in a shareholder securities class action along with its current and certain of its former CEOs and CFOs on the basis that investors suffered damages when their investments in Barclays American Depository Receipts declined in value as a result of the allegations in the Complaint.
Barclays has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
It is possible that additional complaints relating to these or similar matters may be brought in the future against BPLC and or its affiliates.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief.
It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the matters in this section or what effect, if any, that these matters might have upon operating results, cash flows or the Groups financial position in any particular period.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued FERC The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has filed a civil action against BBPLC and certain of its former traders in the US District Court in California seeking to collect on an order assessing a $435m civil penalty and the disgorgement of $34.9m of profits, plus interest, in connection with allegations that BBPLC manipulated the electricity markets in and around California.
BBPLC and the former traders have filed a motion to dismiss the action for improper venue or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the Southern District of New York SDNY, and a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
The US Attorneys Office in the SDNY has informed BBPLC that it is looking into the same conduct at issue in the FERC matter.
Background Information In October 2012, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Proposed Penalties Order and Notice against BBPLC and four of its former traders in relation to the Groups power trading in the western US.
In the Order and Notice, FERC asserted that BBPLC and its former traders violated FERCs Anti-Manipulation Rule by manipulating the electricity markets in and around California from November 2006 to December 2008, and proposed civil penalties and profit disgorgement to be paid by BBPLC.
In July 2013, FERC issued an Order Assessing Civil Penalties in which it assessed a $435m civil penalty against BBPLC and ordered BBPLC to disgorge an additional $34.9m of profits plus interest both of which are consistent with the amounts proposed in the Order and Notice.
In October 2013, FERC filed a civil action against BBPLC and its former traders in the US District Court in California seeking to collect the penalty and disgorgement amount.
FERCs complaint in the civil action reiterates the allegations previously made by FERC in its October 2012 Order and Notice and its July 2013 Order Assessing Civil Penalties.
In September 2013, BBPLC was contacted by the criminal division of the US Attorneys Office in SDNY and advised that such office is looking at the same conduct at issue in the FERC matter.
In December 2013, BBPLC and its former traders filed a motion to dismiss the action for improper venue or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the SDNY, and a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
Proceedings on the motion to dismiss are continuing.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact FERC has made claims against the Group totalling $469.9m, plus interest, for civil penalties and profit disgorgement.
This amount does not necessarily reflect the Groups potential financial exposure if a ruling were to be made against it.
Investigations into LIBOR, other Benchmarks, ISDAfix, Foreign Exchange Rates and Precious Metals Regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments have been conducting investigations relating to BBPLCs involvement in manipulating financial benchmarks and Foreign Exchange rates.
BBPLC has reached settlements with the relevant law enforcement agency or regulator in certain of the investigations, but others, including those set out in more detail below, remain pending.
Background Information The FCA, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC, the SEC, the DOJ Fraud Section DOJ-FS and Antitrust Division DOJ-AD, the European Commission Commission, the SFO, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Japan Financial Services Agency, the prosecutors office in Trani, Italy and various US state attorneys general are amongst various authorities that opened investigations into submissions made by BBPLC and other financial institutions to the bodies that set or compile various financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR and EURIBOR and in connection with efforts to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates.
On 27 June 2012, BBPLC announced that it had reached settlements with the Financial Services Authority FSA as predecessor to the FCA, the CFTC and the DOJ-FS in relation to their investigations concerning certain benchmark interest rate submissions, and BBPLC agreed to pay total penalties of 290m, which were reflected in operating expenses for 2012.
The settlements were made by entry into a Settlement Agreement with the FSA, a Settlement Order with the CFTC CFTC Order and a Non-Prosecution Agreement NPA with the DOJ-FS.
In addition, BBPLC was granted conditional leniency from the DOJ-AD in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
Summaries of the NPA and the CFTC Order are set out below.
The full text of the CFTC Order and the NPA are publicly available on the websites of the CFTC and the DOJ, respectively.
The terms of the Settlement Agreement with the FSA are confidential, but the Final Notice of the FSA is available on the FCAs website.
CFTC Order In addition to a $200m civil monetary penalty, the CFTC Order requires BBPLC to cease and desist from further violations of specified provisions of the US Commodity Exchange Act CEA and take specified steps to ensure the integrity and reliability of its benchmark interest rate submissions, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, and improve related internal controls.
DOJ Non-Prosecution Agreement As part of the NPA, BBPLC agreed to pay a $160m penalty.
In addition, the DOJ agreed not to prosecute BBPLC for any crimes except for criminal tax violations, as to which the DOJ cannot and does not make any agreement related to BBPLCs submissions of benchmark interest rates, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, contingent upon BBPLCs satisfaction of specified obligations under the NPA.
In particular, under the NPA, BBPLC agreed for a period of two years from 26 June 2012, amongst other things, to: Commit no US crimes whatsoever: Truthfully and completely disclose non-privileged information with respect to the activities of BBPLC, its officers and employees, and others concerning all matters about which the DOJ enquires of it, which information can be used for any purpose, except as otherwise limited in the NPA: Bring to the DOJs attention all potentially criminal conduct by BBPLC or any of its employees that relates to fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets: and Bring to the DOJs attention all criminal or regulatory investigations, administrative proceedings or civil actions brought by any governmental authority in the US by or against BBPLC or its employees that alleges fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 307 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued BBPLC also agreed to cooperate with the DOJ and other government authorities in the US in connection with any investigation or prosecution arising out of the conduct described in the NPA, which commitment shall remain in force until all such investigations and prosecutions are concluded.
BBPLC also continues to cooperate with the other ongoing investigations.
In anticipation of the expiry of the two-year period, in June 2014 Barclays and DOJ-FS entered into a letter agreement which: i gives DOJ-FS until 27 June 2015 to make a determination under the NPA solely as to whether any of Barclays trading activities in the Foreign Exchange market during the two-year period from 26 June 2012 constituted the commission of a United States crime: and ii with respect to the ongoing investigation of those trading activities by DOJ-FS and DOJ-AD, extends Barclays obligation to disclose non-privileged information in response to enquiries of the DOJ-FS to 27 June 2015.
The two-year period under the NPA has otherwise expired.
Investigations by the US State Attorneys General Following the settlements announced in June 2012, 31 US State Attorneys General commenced their own investigations into LIBOR, EURIBOR and the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate.
The NYAG, on behalf of this coalition of Attorneys General, issued a subpoena in July 2012 to BBPLC and subpoenas to a number of other banks to produce wide-ranging information and has since issued additional information requests to BBPLC for both documents and transactional data.
BBPLC is responding to these requests on a rolling basis.
Investigation by the SFO In addition, following the settlements announced in June 2012, the SFO announced in July 2012 that it had decided to investigate the LIBOR matter, in respect of which BBPLC has received and continues to respond to requests for information.
Investigations by the European Commission The Commission has also been conducting investigations into the manipulation of, amongst other things, EURIBOR.
On 4 December 2013, the Commission announced that it had reached a settlement with the Group and a number of other banks in relation to anti-competitive conduct concerning EURIBOR.
The Group had voluntarily reported the EURIBOR conduct to the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commissions investigation.
In recognition of this cooperation, the Group was granted full immunity from the financial penalties that would otherwise have applied.
ISDAfix Investigation Regulators and law enforcement agencies, including the CFTC and the DOJ, are also conducting separate investigations into historical practices with respect to ISDAfix, amongst other benchmarks.
BBPLC has received and continues to respond to subpoenas and requests for information from various authorities including the CFTC and the DOJ.
Precious Metals Investigation BBPLC has been providing information to the DOJ in connection with the DOJs investigation into precious metals and precious metals-based financial instruments.
Foreign Exchange Trading Investigation Various regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the FCA, the Commission, the CFTC, the DOJ-FS, the DOJ-AD, the SEC and the New York State Department of Financial Services are investigating a range of issues associated with Foreign Exchange sales and trading, including electronic trading.
The DOJ-AD is also investigating potential violations of US anti-trust laws.
Certain of these investigations involve multiple market participants in various countries.
BBPLC has received enquiries from certain of these authorities related to their particular investigations, and from other regulators interested in Foreign Exchange issues.
The Group is reviewing its Foreign Exchange trading covering a several-year period and is continuing to cooperate with the relevant authorities in their investigations.
In November 2014, the FCA and the CFTC entered into settlement agreements with several banks regarding Foreign Exchange trading.
Barclays announced that it had considered entering into the settlement, but after discussions with other regulators and authorities it concluded that it was in the Groups interest to seek a more general coordinated settlement and that it would continue to engage with these regulators and authorities, including the FCA and CFTC, with the objective of achieving a resolution in due course.
In December 2014, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority HKMA announced the outcome of its investigation into the Foreign Exchange operations of 10 banks in Hong Kong, including BBPLC.
In respect of BBPLC, the HKMA said that its investigation revealed certain control deficiencies in respect of which it required Barclays to take certain remedial steps, but also noted that, in recent years, BBPLC has made enhancements in line with international trends.
Any resolution of the investigations into Foreign Exchange trading and sales and other practices relating to Foreign Exchange could result in substantial monetary penalties.
In addition, any resolution involving a criminal plea would have consequences that could include significant restrictions on the Groups current and future business activities.
For a discussion of litigation arising in connection with these investigations see LIBOR and other Benchmarks Civil Actions, Civil Actions in Respect of ISDAfix, Civil Actions in Respect of Foreign Exchange Trading and Civil Actions in Respect of the Gold Fix below.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact A provision of 1,250m was held as at 31 December 2014 with provisions of 500m and 750m recognised in Q314 and Q414 respectively for certain aspects of ongoing investigations involving certain authorities and litigation relating to Foreign Exchange.
It is not currently practicable to estimate the further financial impact of the matters in this section including the need to recognise additional provisions, or what effect, if any, that these matters might have upon the Groups operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period.
Amongst other things, any violations of criminal law that took place after entering into the DOJ NPA described above could constitute a violation of that NPA, which could lead to additional substantial monetary penalties and significant adverse consequences for the Groups current and future business operations.
LIBOR and other Benchmark Civil Actions A number of individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to manipulation of LIBOR and or other benchmark rates.
While several of such cases have been dismissed and one has settled subject to final approval from the court, others remain pending and their ultimate impact is unclear.

USD LIBOR Cases in MDL Court The majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes before a single judge in the SDNY MDL Court.
The complaints are substantially similar and allege, amongst other things, that BBPLC and the other banks individually and collectively violated provisions of the US Sherman Antitrust Act, the CEA, the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.
The lawsuits seek unspecified damages with the exception of five lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs are seeking a combined total in excess of $1.25bn in actual damages against all defendants, including BBPLC, plus punitive damages.
Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the US Sherman Antitrust Act and RICO.
The proposed class actions purport to be brought on behalf of amongst others plaintiffs that i engaged in USD LIBOR-linked over-the-counter transactions OTC Class : ii purchased USD LIBOR-linked financial instruments on an exchange Exchange-Based Class : iii purchased USD LIBOR-linked debt securities Debt Securities Class : iv purchased adjustable-rate mortgages linked to USD LIBOR Homeowner Class : or v issued loans linked to USD LIBOR Lender Class.
In August 2012, the MDL Court stayed all newly filed proposed class actions and individual actions Stayed Actions, so that the MDL Court could address the motions pending in three lead proposed class actions Lead Class Actions and three lead individual actions Lead Individual Actions.
In March 2013, the MDL Court issued a decision dismissing the majority of claims against BBPLC and other panel bank defendants in the Lead Class Actions and Lead Individual Actions.
Following the decision, the plaintiffs in the Lead Class Actions sought permission to either file an amended complaint or appeal an aspect of the March 2013 decision.
In August 2013 and June 2014, the MDL Court denied the majority of the motions presented in the Lead Class Actions.
As a result, the: Debt Securities Class has been dismissed entirely: The claims of the Exchange-Based Class have been limited to claims under the CEA: and The claims of the OTC Class have been limited to claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
Subsequent to the MDL Courts March 2013 decision, the plaintiffs in the Lead Individual Actions filed a new action in California state court since moved to the MDL Court based on the same allegations as those initially alleged in the proposed class action cases discussed above.
The Debt Securities Class attempted to appeal the dismissal of their action to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Second Circuit, but the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal as untimely on the grounds that the MDL Court had not reached a decision resolving all of the claims in the consolidated actions.
In January 2015, the US Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuits decision, ruling that the Second Circuit must hear the Debt Securities Class appeal.
The OTC Class and the Exchange-Based Class have received permission to join this appeal.
Certain other proposed class actions that had previously been stayed by the MDL Court have also received permission to join the appeal as to the dismissal of their antitrust claims.
In December 2014, the MDL Court granted preliminary approval for the settlement of the remaining Exchange-Based Class claims for $19.98m and has requested that the plaintiffs present a plan for allocation of the settlement proceeds.
Additionally, the MDL Court has begun to address the claims in the Stayed Actions, many of which, including state law fraud and tortious interference claims, were not asserted in the Lead Class Actions.
As a result, in October 2014, the direct action plaintiffs those who have opted out of the class actions filed their amended complaints and in November 2014, the defendants filed their motions to dismiss.
In November 2014, the plaintiffs in the Lender Class and Homeowner Class actions filed their amended complaints.
In January 2015, the defendants filed their motions to dismiss.
Until there are further decisions, the ultimate impact of the MDL Courts decisions will be unclear, although it is possible that the decisions will be interpreted by courts to affect other litigation, including the actions described below, some of which concern different benchmark interest rates.
Additional USD LIBOR Case in the SDNY An additional individual action was commenced in February 2013 in the SDNY against BBPLC and other panel bank defendants.
The plaintiff alleged that the panel bank defendants conspired to increase USD LIBOR, which caused the value of bonds pledged as collateral for a loan to decrease, ultimately resulting in the sale of the bonds at a low point in the market.
This action is not assigned to the MDL Court: it is proceeding on a different schedule before a different judge in the SDNY.
The panel bank defendants have moved to dismiss the action.
Securities Fraud Case in the SDNY BPLC, BBPLC and BCI have also been named as defendants along with four former officers and directors of BBPLC in a proposed securities class action pending in the SDNY in connection with BBPLCs role as a contributor panel bank to LIBOR.
The complaint asserted claims under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, principally alleging that BBPLCs Annual Reports for the years 2006 to 2011 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things BBPLCs compliance with its operational risk management processes and certain laws and regulations.
The complaint also alleged that BBPLCs daily USD LIBOR submissions constituted false statements in violation of US securities law.
The complaint was brought on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all persons or entities that purchased BPLC-sponsored American Depositary Receipts on a US securities exchange between 10 July 2007 and 27 June 2012.
In May 2013, the district court granted BBPLCs motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.
The plaintiffs appealed, and, in April 2014, the Second Circuit issued an order upholding the dismissal of certain of the plaintiffs claims, but reversing the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims that BBPLCs daily USD LIBOR submissions constituted false statements in violation of US securities law.
The action has been remanded back to the district court for further proceedings, and discovery is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2015. barclays.

The amended complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class that includes holders of adjustable rate mortgages linked to USD LIBOR.
In January 2015, the court granted BBPLCs motion for summary judgement and dismissed all of the remaining claims against BBPLC.
The plaintiff has appealed the courts decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the appeal is expected to be fully briefed by the end of summer 2015.
Japanese Yen LIBOR Case in SDNY An additional class action was commenced in April 2012 in the SDNY against BBPLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a plaintiff involved in exchange-traded derivatives.
The complaint also names members of the Japanese Bankers Associations Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate Euroyen TIBOR panel, of which BBPLC is not a member.
The complaint alleges, amongst other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of the CEA and US Sherman Antitrust Act between 2006 and 2010.
The defendants filed a motion to dismiss and, in March 2014, the Court issued a decision granting in part and denying in part that motion.
Specifically, the court dismissed the plaintiffs antitrust claims in full, but sustained the plaintiffs CEA claims.
The defendants motion for reconsideration of the decision concerning the CEA claims was denied by the Court in October 2014.
The plaintiff has moved for leave to file a third amended complaint adding additional claims, including a RICO claim.
All discovery has been stayed through at least May 2015.
EURIBOR Cases In February 2013, a Euribor-related class action was filed against BPLC, BBPLC, BCI and other Euribor panel banks.
The plaintiffs assert antitrust, CEA, RICO, and unjust enrichment claims.
In particular, BBPLC is alleged to have conspired with other Euribor panel banks to manipulate EURIBOR.
The lawsuit is brought on behalf of purchasers and sellers of NYSE LIFFE EURIBOR futures contracts, purchasers of Euro currency-related futures contracts and purchasers of other derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements that are linked to EURIBOR during the period 1 June 2005 through 31 March 2011.

In addition, BBPLC has been granted conditional leniency from the DOJ-AD in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
As a result of that grant of conditional leniency, BBPLC is eligible for i a limit on liability to actual rather than treble damages if damages were to be awarded in any civil antitrust action under US antitrust law based on conduct covered by the conditional leniency, and ii relief from potential joint-and-several liability in connection with such civil antitrust action, subject to BBPLC satisfying the DOJ-AD and the court presiding over the civil litigation of fulfilment of its cooperation obligations.
Non-US Benchmarks Cases In addition to US actions, legal proceedings have been brought or threatened against the Group in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR in a number of jurisdictions.
The number of such proceedings in non-US jurisdictions, the benchmarks to which they relate, and the jurisdictions in which they may be brought have increased over time.
Civil Actions in respect of ISDAfix Since September 2014, a number of ISDAfix related civil actions have been filed in the SDNY on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs, alleging that BBPLC, a number of other banks and one broker, violated the US Sherman Antitrust Act and several state laws by engaging in a conspiracy to manipulate the USD ISDAfix.
A consolidated amended complaint was filed in mid-February 2015.
Pursuant to a schedule issued by the court, the defendants, including BBPLC, will move to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.
Civil Actions in respect of Foreign Exchange Trading Since November 2013, a number of civil actions have been filed in the SDNY on behalf of proposed classes of plaintiffs alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets under the US Sherman Antitrust Act and New York state law and naming several international banks as defendants, including BBPLC.
The SDNY before whom all the cases are pending, has combined all actions alleging a class of US persons in a single consolidated action.
The two actions alleging classes of non-US persons were dismissed on 28 January 2015.
Recent Developments Defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated action was denied on 28 January 2015.
The next step in the proceeding is discovery, which is presently stayed.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact The financial impact of the actions described on the Group or what effect, if any, that they might have upon the Groups operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period is currently uncertain.
Civil Actions in respect of the Gold Fix Since March 2014, a number of civil complaints have been filed in US federal courts, each on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs, alleging that Barclays entities and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. manipulated the prices of gold and gold derivative contracts in violation of the CEA, the US Sherman Antitrust Act, and state antitrust and consumer protection laws.
All of the complaints have been transferred to the SDNY and consolidated for pretrial purposes.

US Residential and Commercial Mortgage-related Activity and Litigation The Groups activities within the US residential mortgage sector during the period from 2005 through 2008 included: Sponsoring and underwriting of approximately $39bn of private-label securitisations: Economic underwriting exposure of approximately $34bn for other private-label securitisations: Sales of approximately $0.2bn of loans to government sponsored enterprises GSEs : Sales of approximately $3bn of loans to others: and Sales of approximately $19.4bn of loans net of approximately $500m of loans sold during this period and subsequently repurchased that were originated and sold to third parties by mortgage originator affiliates of an entity that the Group acquired in 2007 Acquired Subsidiary.
Throughout this time period affiliates of the Group engaged in secondary market trading of US residential mortgaged-backed securities RMBS and US commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS, and such trading activity continues today.
In connection with its loan sales and certain private-label securitisations the Group provided certain loan level representations and warranties R&Ws, which if breached may require the Group to repurchase the related loans.
On 31 December 2014, the Group had unresolved repurchase requests relating to loans with a principal balance of approximately $2.6bn at the time they were sold, and civil actions have been commenced by various parties alleging that the Group must repurchase a substantial number of such loans.
In addition, the Group is party to a number of lawsuits filed by purchasers of RMBS asserting statutory and or common law claims.
The current outstanding face amount of RMBS related to these pending claims against the Group as of 31 December 2014 was approximately $0.9bn.
Regulatory and governmental authorities have initiated wide-ranging investigations into market practices involving mortgage-backed securities, and the Group is co-operating with several of those investigations.
RMBS Repurchase Requests Background The Group was the sole provider of various loan-level R&Ws with respect to: Approximately $5bn of Group sponsored securitisations: Approximately $0.2bn of sales of loans to GSEs: and Approximately $3bn of loans sold to others.
In addition, the Acquired Subsidiary provided R&Ws on all of the $19.4bn of loans it sold to third parties.
R&Ws on the remaining Group sponsored securitisations were primarily provided by third-party originators directly to the securitisation trusts with a Group subsidiary, such as the depositor for the securitisation, providing more limited R&Ws.
There are no stated expiration provisions applicable to most R&Ws made by the Group, the Acquired Subsidiary or these third parties.
Under certain circumstances, the Group and or the Acquired Subsidiary may be required to repurchase the related loans or make other payments related to such loans if the R&Ws are breached.
The unresolved repurchase requests received on or before 31 December 2014 associated with all R&Ws made by the Group or the Acquired Subsidiary on loans sold to GSEs and others and private-label activities had an original unpaid principal balance of approximately $2.6bn at the time of such sale.
A substantial number approximately $2.2 billion of the unresolved repurchase requests discussed above relate to civil actions that have been commenced by the trustees for certain RMBS securitisations in which the trustees allege that the Group and or the Acquired Subsidiary must repurchase loans that violated the operative R&Ws.
Such trustees and other parties making repurchase requests have also alleged that the operative R&Ws may have been violated with respect to a greater but unspecified amount of loans than the amount of loans previously stated in specific repurchase requests made by such trustees.
All of the litigations involving repurchase requests remain at early stages.
RMBS Securities Claims Background As a result of some of the RMBS activities described above, the Group is party to a number of lawsuits filed by purchasers of RMBS sponsored and or underwritten by the Group between 2005 and 2008.
As a general matter, these lawsuits allege, among other things, that the RMBS offering materials allegedly relied on by such purchasers contained materially false and misleading statements and or omissions and generally demand rescission and recovery of the consideration paid for the RMBS and recovery of monetary losses arising out of their ownership.
The original face amount of RMBS related to the pending civil actions against the Group total approximately $2.4bn, of which approximately $0.9bn was outstanding as at 31 December 2014.
Cumulative realised losses reported on these RMBS as at 31 December 2014 were approximately $0.3bn.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 311 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Claimed Amounts Financial Impact If the Group were to lose the pending actions the Group believes it could incur a loss of up to the outstanding amount of the RMBS at the time of judgement taking into account further principal payments after 31 December 2014, plus any cumulative losses on the RMBS at such time and any interest, fees and costs, less the market value of the RMBS at such time and less any provisions taken to date.
Although the purchasers in these securities actions have generally not identified a specific amount of alleged damages, the Group has estimated the total market value of these RMBS as at 31 December 2014 to be approximately $0.6bn.
The Group may be entitled to indemnification for a portion of such losses.
Other Mortgage-related Investigations In addition to the RMBS Repurchase Requests and RMBS Securities Claims, numerous regulatory and governmental authorities, amongst them the DOJ, SEC, Special Inspector General for the US Troubled Asset Relief Program and US Attorneys Office for the District of Connecticut have been investigating various aspects of the mortgage-related business, including issuance and underwriting practices in primary offerings of RMBS and trading practices in the secondary market for both RMBS and CMBS.
The Group is co-operating with these investigations.
Lehman Brothers Since September 2009, the Group has been engaged in litigation with various entities that have sought to challenge certain aspects of the transaction pursuant to which BCI and other companies in the Group acquired most of the assets of Lehman Brothers Inc. LBI in September 2008, as well as the court order Order approving the sale Sale.
The Order was upheld by the courts and is no longer being challenged.
On 5 August 2014, the Second Circuit affirmed the SDNYs rulings in favour of the Group on certain claims with respect to its rights over assets it claims from the Sale.
Background Information In September 2009, motions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the SDNY Bankruptcy Court by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LBHI, the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc.
Trustee and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Committee.
All three motions challenged certain aspects of the Sale, as well as the Order.
The claimants sought an order voiding the transfer of certain assets to BCI, requiring BCI to return to the LBI estate any excess value BCI allegedly received, and declaring that BCI is not entitled to certain assets that it claims pursuant to the Sale documents and the Order Rule 60 Claims.
In January 2010, BCI filed its response to the motions and also filed a motion seeking delivery of certain assets that LBHI and LBI had failed to deliver as required by the Sale documents and the Order together with the Trustees competing claims to those assets, Contract Claims.
In 2011, the Bankruptcy Court rejected the Rule 60 Claims and decided some of the Contract Claims in the Trustees favour and some in favour of the Group.
The Group and the Trustee each appealed the Bankruptcy Courts adverse rulings on the Contract Claims to the SDNY.
LBHI and the Committee did not appeal the Bankruptcy Courts ruling on the Rule 60 Claims.
The SDNY issued an opinion in June 2012, reversing one of the Bankruptcy Courts rulings on the Contract Claims that had been adverse to the Group and affirming the Bankruptcy Courts other rulings on the Contract Claims.
In July 2012, the SDNY issued an agreed judgement implementing the rulings in the opinion Judgement.
Under the Judgement, the Group is entitled to receive: $1.1bn 0.7bn from the Trustee in respect of clearance box assets Clearance Box Assets : and Property held at various institutions in respect of the exchange traded derivatives accounts transferred to BCI in the Sale ETD Margin.
Recent Developments The Trustee appealed the SDNYs adverse rulings to the Second Circuit.
On 5 August 2014, the Second Circuit issued an opinion affirming the rulings of the SDNY that the Group is entitled to receive the Clearance Box Assets and the ETD Margin.
On 1 October 2014, the Trustee filed a motion with the SDNY to confirm the scope of the SDNYs judgement regarding the ETD Margin the Group is entitled to receive.
With that motion, the Trustee is challenging Barclays entitlement to approximately $1.1bn of assets that the Trustee asserts do not constitute ETD Margin.
On 15 December 2014, the Trustee requested that the US Supreme Court review the rulings of the SDNY and the Second Circuit regarding the ETD margin.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact Approximately $1.7bn 1.1bn of the assets to which the Group is entitled as part of the Sale had not been received by 31 December 2014, approximately $0.8bn 0.5bn of which has been recognised as a financial asset on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014.
The unrecognised amount, approximately $0.9bn 0.6bn as of 31 December 2014, effectively represents a provision against the uncertainty inherent in the litigation and potential post-appeal proceedings and issues relating to the recovery of certain assets held by an institution outside the US.
The financial asset reflects an increase of $0.7bn 0.5bn recognised in profit or loss as at 30 September 2014 as a result of greater certainty regarding the recoverability of the Clearance Box Assets and the ETD Margin from the Trustee, as well as decreases resulting from a payment of $1.1bn 0.7bn made by the Trustee to the Group on 8 October 2014, fully discharging the Trustees obligations in respect of the Clearance Box Assets and from a payment of approximately $1.5bn 1bn made by the Trustee to the Group on 10 December 2014 in respect of a portion of the ETD Margin.
In this context, the Group is satisfied with the valuation of the asset recognised on its balance sheet and the resulting level of effective provision.
American Depositary Shares BPLC, BBPLC and various current and former members of BPLCs Board of Directors have been named as defendants in five proposed securities class actions consolidated in the SDNY, alleging misstatements and omissions in registration statements for certain American Depositary Shares offered by BBPLC.
312 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Background Information The consolidated amended complaint, filed in February 2010, asserted claims under the Securities Act of 1933, alleging that registration statements relating to American Depositary Shares representing preferred stock, series 2, 3, 4 and 5 Preferred Stock ADS offered by BBPLC at various times between 2006 and 2008 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things BBPLCs portfolio of mortgage-related including US subprime-related securities, BBPLCs exposure to mortgage and credit market risk, and BBPLCs financial condition.
These complaints did not specifically identify what alleged damages these plaintiffs sought to recover in connection with their claims.
Recent Developments The claims concerning the series 2, 3 and 4 offerings have been dismissed on the basis that they were time barred.
Although the SDNY also dismissed the claims concerning the series 5 offering, the Second Circuit reversed the dismissal and ruled that the plaintiffs should have been permitted to file a second amended complaint in relation to the series 5 offering claims.
This series 5 offering had an original face amount of approximately $2.5 billion.
In June 2014, the SDNY denied defendants motion to dismiss with respect to the claims in the amended complaint concerning the series 5 offering.
The case is now in discovery.
BDC Finance L. L. C. BDC Finance L. L. C. BDC filed a complaint against BBPLC in the NY Supreme Court alleging breach of a portfolio of total return swaps governed by an ISDA Master Agreement collectively, the Agreement.
A ruling was made against BBPLC, but the New York State Court of Appeals effectively reversed that ruling.
Parties related to BDC have also sued BBPLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court in connection with BBPLCs conduct relating to the Agreement.
Background Information In October 2008, BDC filed a complaint in the NY Supreme Court alleging that BBPLC breached the Agreement when it failed to transfer approximately $40m of alleged excess collateral in response to BDCs October 2008 demand Demand.
BDC asserts that under the Agreement BBPLC was not entitled to dispute the Demand before transferring the alleged excess collateral and that even if the Agreement entitled BBPLC to dispute the Demand before making the transfer, BBPLC failed to dispute the Demand.
BDC demands damages totalling $298m plus attorneys fees, expenses, and prejudgement interest.
In August 2012, the NY Supreme Court granted partial summary judgement for BBPLC, ruling that BBPLC was entitled to dispute the Demand before transferring the alleged excess collateral, but determining that a trial was required to determine whether BBPLC actually did so.
The parties cross-appealed to the Appellate Division of the NY Supreme Court NY Appellate Division.
In September 2011, BDCs investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, L. L. C. and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, L. L. C. also sued BBPLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from BBPLCs conduct relating to the Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective business relations.
The parties have agreed to a stay of that case.
In October 2013, the NY Appellate Division reversed the NY Supreme Courts grant of partial summary judgement in favour of BBPLC, and instead granted BDCs motion for partial summary judgement, holding that BBPLC breached the Agreement.
The NY Appellate Division did not rule on the amount of BDCs damages, which has not yet been determined by the NY Supreme Court.
Recent Developments In January 2014 the NY Appellate Division granted BBPLC leave to appeal its October 2013 decision to the NY Court of Appeals.
The New York Court of Appeals heard oral argument on 6 January 2015 and on 19 February 2015 modified the NY Appellate Divisions grant of partial summary judgement to BDC, holding that summary judgement in either partys favour cannot be granted because a material issue of fact remains as to whether BBPLC breached the Agreement.
The New York Court of Appeals ordered that the matter be referred back to the NY Supreme Court for further proceedings.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact BDC has made claims against the Group totalling $298m plus attorneys fees, expenses and pre-judgement interest.
Civil Actions in respect of the US Anti-Terrorism Act In November 2014, a civil complaint was filed in the US Federal Court in the Eastern District of New York by a group of approximately 200 plaintiffs, alleging that the Group and a number of other banks engaged in a conspiracy and violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act ATA by facilitating US dollar denominated transactions for the Government of Iran and various Iranian banks, which in turn funded Hezbollah attacks that injured the plaintiffs family members.
Plaintiffs seek to recover for pain, suffering and mental anguish pursuant to the provisions of the ATA, which allows for the tripling of any proven damages.
Claimed Amounts Financial Impact It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the matters in this section or what effect, if any, that these matters might have upon operating results, cash flows or the Groups financial position in any particular period.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 313 Notes to the financial statements Accruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 29 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued Credit Default Swap CDS Antitrust Investigations The Commission and the DOJ-AD commenced investigations in the CDS market, in 2011 and 2009, respectively.
In July 2013 the Commission addressed a Statement of Objections to BBPLC, 12 other banks, Markit Ltd. and ISDA.
The case relates to concerns that certain banks took collective action to delay and prevent the emergence of exchange traded credit derivative products.
If the Commission does reach a decision in this matter it has indicated that it intends to impose sanctions.
The Commissions sanctions can include fines.
The DOJ-ADs investigation is a civil investigation and relates to similar issues.
Barclays is also contesting a proposed, consolidated class action alleging similar issues that has been filed in the US.
Disclosure in the case is ongoing.
Interchange Investigations Investigations of Visa and MasterCard credit and debit interchange rates by competition authorities in Europe remain open.
BBPLC receives interchange fees, as a card issuer, from providers of card acquiring services to merchants.
The key risks arising from the investigations comprise the potential for fines imposed by competition authorities, litigation and the implementation of new regulations that impact interchange fees.
Interest Rate Hedging Products Redress See Note 27 for a description of the FSAs review and redress exercise in respect of interest rate hedging products and the provisions recognised by the Group in connection with it.
General The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in the UK and a number of overseas jurisdictions.
It is subject to legal proceedings by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including but not limited to disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.
The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with but not limited to consumer protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.
At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters will not be material to the Groups results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter s and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Employee benefits The notes included in this section focus on the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.
34 Share based payments Accounting for share based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the date the award is granted or notified and the vesting date of the shares or options.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions such as continuing to make payments into a share based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2014 2013 2012 m m m Share Value Plan 575 576 610 Others 84 126 173 Total equity settled 659 702 783 Cash settled 43 25 35 Total share based payments 702 727 818 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share Value Plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for Executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three years in equal annual tranches.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
Other schemes In addition to the SVP, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by and settled in the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which are individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Included within other schemes are Sharesave both UK and overseas, the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan and the Executive Share Award Scheme.

322 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Pensions and post retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and post retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes including defined contribution, defined benefit and post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligation to members of the scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method on the assumptions set out in the note below.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets remeasurements that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the plan, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred, the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on plan assets excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction.
Post-employment benefits the cost of providing health care benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
Pension schemes UK Retirement Fund UKRF The UKRF is the Groups main scheme, representing 92% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises ten sections, the most significant of which are: Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element.
The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. An investment related increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Between 1 October 2003 and 1 October 2012 the majority of new employees outside of Investment Bank were eligible to join this section.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF.
The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are more limited than in traditional final salary pension plans, being the risk of needing to make additional contributions if preretirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.
The discretionary element of the benefit provides a partial buffer against this risk.
The 1964 Pension Scheme: most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010 members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or Pension Investment Plan PIP, a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions.
The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 pension section are typical of final salary pension plans: principally, that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.
Barclays Pension Savings Plan BPSP From 1 October 2012 a new UK pension scheme, the BPSP, was established to satisfy Auto Enrolment legislation.
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme Group Personal Pension providing benefits for all new Barclays UK hires from 1 October 2012, Investment Bank UK employees who were in PIP as at 1 October 2012, and also all UK employees who were not members of a pension scheme as at that date.
As a defined contribution plan, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or longevity risks that defined benefit plans face.
Members benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.
Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US and South African defined benefit schemes.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts.
Others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local environments.
Governance The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation.
The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays or the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans.
Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, and is regulated by the FCA.
Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Groups other pension schemes, although different legislation covers overseas schemes where, in most cases, the Group has the power to determine the funding rate.
Amounts recognised The following tables include amounts recognised in the income statement and an analysis of benefit obligations and scheme assets for all Group defined benefit schemes.
The net position is reconciled to the assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet.

Of the total benefit obligation of 30,392m 2013: 27,568m, 286m 2013: 298m was wholly unfunded.
As at 31 December 2014, the UKRFs scheme assets were in deficit versus IAS 19R obligations by 1,104m 2013: deficit of 1,432m.
The decrease in the net deficit was driven by a rise in asset values, with the increase in liabilities arising from the decrease in the discount rate partly offset by a decrease in the long term RPI inflation rate.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions, below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for UKRF.
Discount rate 3.67 4.46 Inflation rate 3.05 3.42 Rate of increase in salaries 2.55 2.92 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.98 3.32 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 2.98 3.32 Afterwork revaluation rate 3.35 3.70 The UKRF discount rate assumptions for 2014 and 2013 are taken based on the single equivalent discount rate implied by the Towers Watson RATE Link model.
324 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 35 Pensions and post retirement benefits continued The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2014 of Barclays own post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of the recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2013 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long term trend of 1.25% p. a. in future improvements.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the last three years: Assumed life expectancy 2014 2013 2012 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 28.3 27.9 27.8 Females 29.9 29.0 28.9 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 30.1 29.3 29.2 Females 31.9 30.6 30.5 Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the UKRF assumptions table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly.
The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown.
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

Assets A long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long-term investment strategy ensures, amongst other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.
Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term investment strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.
The value of assets shown reflects the actual physical assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a mark to market basis.
The value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows: Analysis of scheme assets Total Of which relates to UKRF % of total % of total fair value of fair value of scheme scheme Value assets Value assets m % m % As at 31 December 2014 Equities quoted 6,813 23.6 5,808 21.6 Equities non-quoted 1,549 5.4 1,537 5.7 a Bonds fixed government 934 3.2 609 2.3 a Bonds index-linked government 7,114 24.6 7,114 26.5 a Bonds corporate and other 5,599 19.4 5,317 19.8 b Property commercial 2,023 7.0 1,945 7.3 b Derivatives 1,472 5.1 1,472 5.5 Cash 2,897 10.0 2,644 9.9 c Pooled funds 284 1.0 284 1.1 b Other 189 0.7 97 0.3 Fair value of scheme assets 28,874 100.0 26,827 100.0 Notes a Assets held are predominantly quoted.

The UKRF also invests in investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by the Barclays Group.
The UKRF scheme assets also includes 36.2m 2013: 35.9m relating to UK private equity investments and 1,502m 2013: 1,255m relating to overseas private equity investments.
These are disclosed above within equities non quoted.
Approximately a third of the UKRF assets are invested in liability driven investment strategies: primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps.
These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities.
The swaps are used to reduce the schemes inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.
Funding The latest triennial funding valuation of the UKRF was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2013.
This was completed in 2014 and showed a deficit of 3.6bn and a funding level of 87.4%.
The Bank and Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles, a schedule of contributions and a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit in the Fund.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions are a more prudent longevity assumption for funding and a different approach to setting the discount rate.
The recovery plan to eliminate the deficit will result in the Bank paying deficit contributions to the Fund until 2021.
Deficit contributions of 300m are payable in 2015, and also in 2016.
Further deficit contributions of 740m p. a. are payable during 2017 to 2021.
Up to 500m of the 2021 deficit contributions are payable in 2017 depending on the deficit level at that time.
These deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Groups share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year.
In non-valuation years the Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position.
The latest annual update was carried out as at 30 September 2014 and showed a deficit of 4.6bn and a funding level of 85.4%.
The increase in funding deficit over the year to 30 September 2014 can be mainly attributed to the fall in real gilt yields over the year.
Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows: Contributions paid m 2014 241 2013 238 2012 742 The Groups expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2015 is 622m 2014: 218m.
In addition the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2015 is 41m 2014: 46m to the UKRF and 107m 2014: 103m to the BPSP.
For the material non-UK defined benefit schemes the expected contributions in 2015 are 56m 2014: 107m.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation This section presents information on the Groups investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and its interests in structured entities.
Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.
36 Principal subsidiaries Barclays applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
The significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.
Accounting for investment in subsidiaries In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.
Cost includes any directly attributable costs of the investment.
Principal subsidiaries for the Group are set out below.
This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Groups business, results or financial position.
NonNoncontrolling controlling interests interests Percentage proportion of proportion of of voting ownership voting Principal place of business rights held interests interests Company name or incorporation Nature of business % % % Barclays Bank PLC England Banking, holding company 100 11 Barclays Capital Securities Limited England Securities dealing 100 Barclays Private Clients International Limited Isle of Man Banking 100 Barclays Securities Japan Limited Japan Securities dealing 100 Barclays Africa Group Limited South Africa Banking 62 38 38 Barclays Bank S.

United States Securities dealing 100 Barclays Bank Delaware United States Credit card issuer 100 The country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries.
Investments in subsidiaries held directly by Barclays Bank PLC are marked.
Information on the Groups subsidiaries, as required by the Companies Act, will be included in the Annual Return to be filed at the UK Companies House.
Ownership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares.
See Note 33 Non-controlling interests for more information.
At the balance sheet date, a contractual agreement for the sale and transfer of Barclays Bank S. A. U. and its subsidiaries, comprising all its associated assets and liabilities to a third party, Caixabank, S. A. was in place.
The sale took place on 2 January 2015, but Barclays Bank S. A. U. was still a principal subsidiary at the balance sheet date.
Significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the scope of the consolidation Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital.
However, in certain instances this determination will involve significant judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities.
This judgement may involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity.
It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities.
In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors exposures to the structures variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 327 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 36 Principal subsidiaries continued An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity.
However certain entities are excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to their variable returns.
These entities are controlled by external counterparties rather than the Group.
Where appropriate, interests relating to these entities are included in Note 37 Structured entities.
Percentage of voting Equity shareholders Retained profit for Country of registration or incorporation Company name rights held % funds m the year m UK Fitzroy Finance Limited 100 Cayman Islands Palomino Limited 100 1 Significant restrictions As is typical for a Group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests.
Regulatory requirements Barclays principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of 1,757bn 2013: 1,789bn and 1,683bn 2013: 1,720bn respectively.
The assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated.
These require entities to maintain minimum capital, leverage and exposure ratios restricting the ability of these entities to make distributions of cash or other assets to the parent company, Barclays PLC.
In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may hold certain equity accounted and debt accounted issued financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liability.
See Note 33 Non-controlling interests and Note 30 Subordinated liabilities for particulars of these instruments.
These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.
Liquidity requirements Regulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to maintain liquidity pools to meet PRA and local regulatory requirements.
The main subsidiaries affected are Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Africa Group Limited and Barclays Capital Inc. which must maintain daily compliance with the regulatory minimum.
See page 191 to 208 for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of our significant subsidiaries.
Statutory requirements The Groups subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency.
These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation.
In most cases the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.
Contractual requirements Asset encumbrance The Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks.
Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group.
The assets affected are disclosed in Note 40 Assets pledged.
Assets held by consolidated structured entities 379m 2013: 690m of assets included in the Groups balance sheet relate to consolidated investment funds and are held to pay return and principal to the holders of units in the funds.
The assets held in these funds cannot be transferred to other members of the Group.
The decrease is materially driven by the closure of European wealth funds during the year.
Other restrictions The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities and these amounted to 4,448m 2013: 4,722m.
Barclays Africa Group Limited assets are subject to exchange control regulation determined by the South African Reserve Bank SARB.
Special dividends and loans in lieu of dividends cannot be transferred without SARB approval.
37 Structured entities A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
Depending on the Groups power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity.
In other cases it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities The Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities: 328 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 37 Structured entities continued Securitisation vehicles The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.
Refer to Note 39 Securitisations for further detail.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to certain securitisation vehicles.
At 31 December 2014, there were outstanding loan commitments to these entities totalling 201m 2013: 195m.
Commercial paper CP and medium term note conduits The Group provided 9.1bn 2013: 8.1bn in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to CP conduits.
Fund management entities Barclays has contractually guaranteed the performance of certain cash investments in a number of managed investment funds which have resulted in their consolidation.
As at 31 December 2014, the notional value of the guarantee was 585m 2013: 991m.
Covered bonds During the period the Group provided cash capital contributions totalling 0.7bn 2013: 1.3bn to Barclays Covered Bonds Limited Liability Partnership as a result of regulatory requirements to pre fund upcoming covered bond redemptions.
This requirement is expected to increase as more covered bonds approach their maturity in 2015.
Employee benefit trusts The Group provides capital contributions to employee share trusts to enable them to meet their obligations to employees under share-based payment plans.
Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has an interest An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group.
Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.
Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.
The nature and extent of the Groups interests in structured entities is summarised below: Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities Short-term Secured traded Traded Other financing interests derivatives interests Total m m m m m As at December 2014 Assets Trading portfolio assets 14,538 3,668 18,206 Financial assets designated at fair value 963 963 Derivative financial instruments 5,207 1,594 6,801 Available for sale investments 1,216 1,216 Loans and advances to banks 4,277 4,277 Loans and advances to customers 30,067 30,067 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 37,139 37,139 Other assets 38 38 Total assets 37,139 14,538 5,207 41,823 98,707 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 5,222 1,514 6,736 As at December 2013 Assets Trading portfolio assets 12,729 5,111 17,840 Financial assets designated at fair value 1,035 1,035 Derivative financial instruments 3,758 1,464 5,222 Available for sale investments 2,073 2,073 Loans and advances to banks 4,143 4,143 Loans and advances to customers 24,971 24,971 Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending 51,112 51,112 Other assets 35 35 Total assets 51,112 12,729 3,758 38,832 106,431 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 4,895 1,457 6,352 barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 329 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 37 Structured entities continued Secured financing arrangements, short term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under market risk management described in page 175 which includes an indication of the change of risk measures compared to last year.
For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented.
Other interests include a Non-Core portfolio which is being managed down, conduits and corporate lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.
Secured financing The Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity.
Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group has minimal exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty.
A description of these transactions is included in Note 22.
Short-term traded interests The Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar interests.
Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days.
In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.
As at 31 December 2014, 12,058m 2013: 11,634m of the Groups 14,538m 2013: 12,729m short-term traded interests were comprised of debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles.
Traded derivatives The Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices amongst other things.
The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include index-based and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps.
A description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 15.
The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall.
Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Groups normal credit policies.
Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.
Included in the traded derivatives total are 445m 2013: 752m of derivative assets which are cleared derivative type arrangements.
These are transactions where the Group enters into a contract with an exchange on behalf of a structured entity client and holds an opposite position with it.
The Group is exposed to settlement risk only on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining.
Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain.
In addition, the Groups losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets on a daily basis in most cases.
Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Groups interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose of the entities and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.

Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.
Structured Credit Portfolio This comprises interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles, mainly Collateralised Loan Obligations CLOs, Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs, Residential and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securitisation structures RMBSs and CMBSs, and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities.
In some cases, the securities are wrapped with credit protection from a monoline insurer, which transfers the credit risk to the monoline.
The entities are wholly debt financed through the issuance of tranches of debt securities or through direct funding, such as the loan facilities provided by the Group.
As the underlying assets of the entities amortise and pay down, the debt securities issued by the entities are repaid in order of seniority.
Where the entities experience significant credit deterioration, debt securities may be written off or cancelled in reverse order of seniority.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 331 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 37 Structured entities continued As at 31 December 2014, the Groups funded exposures comprised 3,591m 2013: 4,945m debt securities at fair value and 3,390m 2013: 3,115m amortised cost loans and advances.
Of the 6,981m 2013: 8,060m, 4,822m 2013: 6,576m is investment grade, with the remainder either non-investment graded or not rated.
The Group also had 1,078m 2013: 1,411m of unfunded exposures in the form of undrawn liquidity commitments.
Of the 8,059m 2013: 9,471m of funded and unfunded exposures, 7,897m 2013: 9,082m is senior in the capital structure of the entity.
Though the Groups funded exposures are primarily investment grade and senior in the capital structure, there are cases where the interests that are subordinate to the Groups senior and mezzanine interests have minimal or no value, due to decreases in the fair value of the underlying collateral held by the entity.
The Groups income from these entities comprises trading income largely gains and losses on changes in the fair value and interest earned on bonds on items classified as held for trading and interest income on interests classified as loans and receivables.
During 2014, the Group recorded a fair value loss of 91m 2013: 639m gain on debt securities.
Impairment losses recorded on loans and advances were immaterial in both the current and prior year.
The fair value of the Groups interests in certain CLOs and CDOs is influenced by the protection directly provided to the structured entities by monoline insurers in addition to the value of the collateral held by the entities.
The protection provided to the entities by the monoline insurers is in the form of a CDS.
However, the ability of the monolines to make payments is uncertain, which is reflected in the valuation of the Groups interests in the monoline wrapped CLOs and CDOs.
Multi-seller conduit programmes The conduits engage in providing financing to various clients and hold whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar obligations.
These instruments are protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduits.
The Groups off balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduits for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduits and will only be drawn where the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market.
If these facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through , seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduits.
The Group earns income from fees received on the liquidity facility and the letter of credit provided to the conduits.
There were no impairment losses on this lending in either of the current year or the prior year.
Lending The portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by property, equipment or other assets.
All loans are subject to the Groups credit sanctioning process.
Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements.
During the period the Group incurred an impairment of 31m 2013: 20m against such facilities.
The main types of lending are 4bn 2013: 4bn of funding loans to bankruptcy remote structured entities to either invest or develop properties, 5bn 2013: 2bn of loans to structured entities which have been created by an individual to hold one or more assets, 2bn 2013: 2bn to entities whose operations are limited to financing or funding the acquisition of specific assets such as schools, hospitals, roads and renewable energy projects under the Private Finance Initiative PFI, and 1bn 2013: 1bn of funding loans to bankruptcy remote structured entities to enable them to purchase capital equipment for parent companies and are supported by government export guarantees.
Mortgage-backed securities This represents a portfolio of floating rate notes, mainly mortgage-backed security positions, used as an accounting hedge of interest rate risk under the Groups structural hedging programme.
All notes are investment grade.
The portfolio has decreased owing to a reduced requirement for hedge accounting capacity in sterling.
Investment funds and trusts In the course of its fund management activities, the Group establishes pooled investment funds that comprise investments of various kinds, tailored to meet certain investors requirements.
The Groups interest in funds is generally restricted to a fund management fee, the value of which is typically based on the performance of the fund.
The Group acts as trustee to a number of trusts established by or on behalf of its clients.
The purpose of the trusts, which meet the definition of structured entities, is to hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries.
The Groups interest in trusts is generally restricted to unpaid fees which, depending on the trust, may be fixed or based on the value of the trust assets.
Barclays has no other risk exposure to the trusts.
Other This includes 1,514m 2013: 1,457m of derivative transactions with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts.
Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were immaterial.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information 38 Investments in associates and joint ventures Accounting for associates and joint ventures Barclays applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies.
Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint ventures are arrangements where the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Groups share of the post acquisition profit or loss.
The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.
There are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by Barclays.

The Groups associates and joint ventures are subject to statutory requirements such that they cannot make remittances of dividends or make loan repayments to Barclays PLC without agreement from the external parties.
The Groups share of commitments and contingencies of its associates and joint ventures comprised unutilised credit facilities provided to customers of 1,566m 2013: 2,156m.
In addition, the Group has made commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and associates of 183m 2013: 74m.
39 Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either legally where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficial where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty.
Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
When an asset is transferred, in some circumstances, the Group may retain an interest in it continuing involvement requiring the Group to repurchase it in certain circumstances for other than its fair value on that date.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 333 Notes to the financial statements Scope of consolidation 39 Securitisations continued A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below: Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition Securitisations The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card balances.
In addition, the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other lending institutions for securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third-party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.
Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2014 2013 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Carrying amount Value amount Value amount amount m m m m m m Loans and advances to customers Residential mortgage loans 2,830 2,619 2,352 2,360 3,930 3,545 Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 7,060 7,162 5,160 5,178 6,563 5,017 Corporate loans 157 154 135 146 331 294 Total 10,047 9,935 7,647 7,684 10,824 8,856 Assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Retained interest in residential mortgage loans 66 n a n a 68 Balances included within loans and advances to customers represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.
The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.
Residential mortgage loans in 2014 exclude Barclays Non-Core securitised assets of 1,345m 2013: 1,566m and liabilities of 1,305m 2013: 1,561m which relate to the European Geneva securitisation which has been designated as held for sale.
The 2013 balances have not been restated.
Retained interests in residential mortgage loans are securities which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk in the underlying securitised assets.
The carrying amount of the loans before transfer was 120m 2013: 124m.
The retained interest is initially recorded as an allocation of the original carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained.
For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, see Notes 22 and 40.
Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it.
This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Groups involvement with CLOs, CDOs, RMBS and CMBS.
Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.
The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement: Continuing involvement Gain loss from as at 31 December 2014 continuing involvement For the year Cumulative Maximum ended 31 to 31 Carrying Fair exposure December December amount value to loss 2014 2014 Type of transfer m m m m m CLO and other assets 1,370 1,354 1,370 14 720 US sub-prime and Alt-A 208 195 208 1,365 Commercial mortgage backed securities 200 200 200 15 8 Total 1,778 1,749 1,778 29 2,093 334 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 barclays.

These amendments do not have any impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income and the statement of change in equity.

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary and the sale must be highly probable.
Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

A. U and its subsidiaries.
These were disposed of as part of the rationalisation of the Non-Core segment of the Group, announced in the Strategy Update on 8 May 2014.
The sale, initially announced to the market on 31 August 2014, was completed on 2 January 2015.
A write down to fair value less costs to sell of 734m is recognised on the disposal group, of which 263m was allocated against the carrying amount of individual assets within the scope of measurement requirements of IFRS 5 and 471m has been allocated to the disposal group as a whole.
A loss of 446m has been recognised in the income statement within loss profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
This reflects the net impact of the write down of assets in line with IFRS 5 of 734m and other transaction related costs of 27m, partially offset by the gain on related hedging instruments of 315m.
Accumulated currency translation reserve losses of 100m will be recognised in the income statement on completion of the sale.
Sale of Barclaycard Loan Portfolio Other assets includes 1.7bn relating to a customer loan book, intended for sale during the first half of 2015 as part of the strategy to wind down the Non-Core segment of the Group.
No write down is recognised under IFRS 5 as the fair value less costs to sell is expected to exceed the current carrying value.
