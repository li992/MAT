A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the above Notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of the rights of the member to attend, speak and vote in his place.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
If a member appoints more than one proxy to attend the meeting, each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by the member.
To appoint a proxy you may use the form of proxy enclosed with this Annual Report.
To be valid, the form of proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority if any under which it is signed or a notarially certi ed or of ce copy of the same, must be completed and returned to the of ce of the Companys registrar in accordance with the instructions printed thereon as soon as possible and in any event by not later than 11.30 a. m. on 27 April 2015.

The latest time for the submission of proxy votes electronically is 11.30 a. m. on 27 April 2015.
Completion and return of the form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending the meeting and voting in person.
Any person receiving a copy of this Notice as a person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 a Nominated Person should note that the provisions in Notes 1 and 2 above concerning the appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting in place of a member, do not apply to a Nominated Person as only shareholders have the right to appoint a proxy.
However, a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement between the Nominated Person and the member by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as proxy for the meeting.
If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he she may have a right under such agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights at the meeting.
Nominated Persons should also remember that their main point of contact in terms of their investment in the Company remains the member who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy the information rights or perhaps the custodian or broker who administers the investment on their behalf.
Nominated Persons should continue to contact that member, custodian or broker and not the Company regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Persons personal details and interest in the Company including any administrative matter.
The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from the Nominated Person.
Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncerti cated Securities Regulations 2001, only shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company by not later than 6.00 p. m. two days prior to the time xed for the meeting shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at such time.
If the meeting is adjourned, the time by which a person must be entered on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the adjourned meeting is 6.00 p. m. two days prior to the time of the adjournment.
Changes to the register of members after the relevant times shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote whether in person or by proxy shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members of the Company in respect of the relevant joint holding.
Holders of shares through the Savings Schemes are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting if the voting instruction form, which is enclosed with this document, is correctly completed and returned in accordance with the instructions printed thereon.
Shareholders who hold their shares electronically may submit their votes through CREST, by submitting the appropriate and authenticated CREST message so as to be received by the Companys registrar not later than 48 hours before the start of the meeting.
Instructions on how to vote through CREST can be found by accessing the following website: euroclear.
Shareholders are advised that CREST and the internet are the only methods by which completed proxies can be submitted electronically.
If you are a CREST system user including a CREST personal member you can appoint one or more proxies or give an instruction to a proxy by having an appropriate CREST message transmitted.
To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy whether previously appointed or otherwise via the CREST system, CREST messages must be received by Computershare ID number 3RA50 not later than 48hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting.
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time as determined by the timestamp generated by the CREST system from which Computershare is able to retrieve the message.
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members should contact their CREST sponsor for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST.
For further information on CREST procedures, limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST manual.
The Company may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35 5 a of the Uncerti cated Securities Regulations 2001.
If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given discretion as to how the votes subject of those proxies are cast and voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when added to the interest in the Companys securities already held by the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of voting rights that he has a noti able obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make the necessary noti cations to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority.
As a result, any member holding 3% or more of the voting rights in the Company, who grants the Chairman a discretionary proxy in respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would otherwise have a noti cation obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, need not make a separate noti cation to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority.
Any question relevant to the business of the meeting may be asked at the meeting by anyone permitted to speak at the meeting.
A shareholder may alternatively submit a question in advance by a letter addressed to the Company Secretary at the Companys registered of ce.
Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, the Company must answer any question a shareholder asks relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting, unless i answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of con dential information: ii the answer had already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question: or iii it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that, if it is appointing more than one corporate representative, it does not do so in relation to the same shares.
It is therefore no longer necessary to nominate a designated corporate representative.
Representatives should bring to the meeting evidence of their appointment, including any authority under which it is signed.
