However, we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business as set out in note 17.
The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made limiting these to acquisition related costs and costs incurred on termination of derivative financial instruments.
A reconciliation of EPRA earnings per share to the Groups measure of underlying earnings per share is provided below.
On 22 April 2014, the Company issued 278,241,628 new ordinary shares of 50 pence each through a rights issue.
The number of shares previously used to calculate earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the rights issue as per note 17.

co. uk Other information EPRA performance measures unaudited Continued 4 EPRA NAV a EPRA NAV EPRA NAV has been presented as recommended by EPRA which seeks to assist comparison between European property companies.
However, we believe that our measure of NAV per share diluted, adjusted, as presented in note 18a, is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.
The key difference is the swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt which are excluded in the Groups definition of NAV per share diluted, adjusted.
The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historic accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group.
A reconciliation of EPRA NAV to the Groups measure of NAV per share diluted, adjusted is provided below.
As for earnings per share, the comparative number of shares have been adjusted to reflect the rights issue.
