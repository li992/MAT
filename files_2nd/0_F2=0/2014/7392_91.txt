CONTINGENT LIABILITIES A contingent liability existed at the balance sheet date in respect of external guarantees and letters of credit totalling $45 million 2013:$41 million.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacturing at alimited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, has the potential to produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed inindividual territories.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is highly regulated and the operations of market participants, such as Hikma, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA and the Department of Justice.
As a result the Group is subject to certain ongoing investigations by governmental agencies as well as other various legalproceedings considered typical to its business relating to employment, product liability and commercial disputes.

Further details of the general employee share option plan are as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted average exercise average exercise Number of price Number of price share options in $ share options in $ Outstanding at 1 January 228,600 7.33 539,700 7.33 Exercised during the year 61,100 6.67 302,200 6.74 Expired during the year 24,000 0.91 8,900 9.18 Outstanding at 31 December 143,500 7.60 228,600 7.33 Exercisable at 31 December 143,500 7.60 228,600 6.85 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was $27.2.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of less than four years.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Long Term Incentive Plan During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company had a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP settled by equity instruments, with 15separate grant dates.
Under the LTIP, conditional awards and nil cost options are granted which vest after three years subject to aTotalShareholder Return TSR performance condition.
This condition measures the Groups TSR relative to a comparator group of otherpharmaceutical companies.
In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% forupper quartile performance, with pro rata vesting in between these points.
No awards vest for performance which is below the median.
For awards made from 2011, the TSR condition applies in respect of 50% of the award and financial metrics apply in respect of the remaining 50%.
For further details see the Remuneration Committee Report.
The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the LTIP was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo simulation methodology.
For awards made from 2011, 50% of the award is subject to a TSR performance condition which was valued by applying the Monte Carlo simulation methodology: the remaining 50% of the award is subject to financial metrics which are valued by applying the Black-Scholes model.
The exercise price of the share award is $nil.
