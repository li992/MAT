Directors Remuneration Report continued Operation of policy in 2015 Base salary As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans letter, the Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors during the course of 2014.
During its review, the Committee was mindful of the Groups philosophy to place greater emphasis on variable, performance related remuneration, whilst recognising that base salaries for the Executive Directors had not been increased for at least the past five years, while the size and complexity of the business has grown significantly: a more than 100% increase in the market capitalisation of the Group from c. 422m to c. 917m as at the end of December 2014: revenues in the five years having almost doubled from c. 560.7m to, in 2014, 1,078.2m, accompanied by strong growth in underlying Profit Before Tax from 25.2m to, in 2014, 100.5m: the employee base of the Group increasing from c. 20,000 employees to c. 27,000 employees as at December 2014: and the Group having made very strong progress in delivering its strategic objectives, in particular in terms of extending its geographic footprint which now includes the USA and service line offering.
Taking into account the above and the cumulative increase in base salaries of senior Directors in the UK business over the five-year period the Committee agreed that it would be appropriate to increase the base salaries for the Executive Directors with effect from 1March 2015 as follows: Group Chief Executive to 275,000 per annum from 225,000 per annum : and Group Chief Financial Officer to 210,000 per annum from 175,000 per annum.
Following the increases, in line with our policy, the base salaries for the Executive Directors will continue to be positioned significantly below market median against the FTSE 250.
Variable remuneration For the profit share, the target weighting will be 70% in relation to the Groups annual profit performance and 30% in relation to delivery against a mix of strategic and operational objectives.
The Committee will keep the weighting of reward for delivery of corporate and strategic operational objectives under review for future years.
The Committee considers prospective disclosure of profit share targets to be commercially sensitive and disclosure will therefore be on a retrospective basis.
The remuneration policy is for maximum awards of 200% of salary.
The awards for 2015 will be: 550,000 for the Group Chief Executive: and 350,000 for the Group Financial Officer.
As with the 2014 awards, the EPS targets for 50% of the award will be as follows: 25% i. e. threshold of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 3% p. a. compound: 100% i. e. the maximum of the element to vest if the Companys EPS growth is RPI plus 10% p. a. compound or more.
Straight-line vesting between the two points.
The other 50% of the award will be subject to relative TSR performance versus the FTSE Mid 250 index excluding investment trusts.
25% of the element will vest for equalling the index, with 100% vesting for outperforming the index by 8% p. a. compound or more.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Clawback and malus Following the publication of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee determined that clawback and malus provisions should be extended across the cash and the share elements of the annual performance-related profit share and also to the Performance Share Plan.
The Committee also reviewed the circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply and determined that it would be appropriate to extend the established malus and clawback provisions so that they encompass the following: a material misstatement of the Groups financial results: serious misconduct by the individual: and a factual error in calculating an award or vesting.
The malus provision has also been extended to include other exceptional developments which have an actual or potential material adverse effect on the value or reputation of the Group as determined by the Committee.
Clawback will apply for a two-year period post the vesting of awards.
In the event of a regulatory or criminal enquiry ongoing at that point, the clawback period will be extended to a six-month period post the conclusion of such an event.
