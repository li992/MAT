Dixons Retail plc 22 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Enfocus Software - Customer Support Enfocus Software - Customer Support Directors Report Performance Review Group Financial Summary continued Discontinued operations During the year, the Group disposed of its Turkish and Italian operations as well as PIXmania.
In addition, following the year end, the Group also announced the disposal of its Central European operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
All four businesses have been classified as discontinued and charges associated with these exits comprise the trading losses of 42.1 million together with the loss incurred on the disposal transactions of 116.0 million.
Property losses Underlying property losses were 25.4 million 2012 13 loss of 24.4 million.
These comprise mainly store re-site and store asset disposal costs, predominantly in the UK and Nordics.
Underlying net finance costs Underlying net finance costs were 36.6 million 2012 13 35.4 million.
The increase in costs was primarily due to the full year net effect of issuance of the 2017 Notes, partial redemption of the 2015 Notes and full redemption of the 2012 Bonds and associated hedging instruments in the prior year.
Tax The Groups underlying tax charge equates to an effective rate of 30.4% 2012 13 35.8%.
The decrease in the tax rate has, in the main, been affected by an increase in the proportion of taxable profits relative to the non-deductible expenses.
Pensions The IAS 19 accounting deficit of the defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme amounted to 399.8 million compared to 406.4 million at 30 April 2013.
The assumptions used for determining the accounting valuation use a consistent basis to that adopted at 30 April 2013 which build from the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010.
The deficit remains largely unchanged as a result of financial assumptions which determine liabilities and asset values remaining broadly the same from one year end to the next.
The next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2013 has commenced with the results expected in the first half of 2014 15.
