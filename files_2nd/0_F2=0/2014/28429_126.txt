Following the completion of the process of domestication of the Hong Kong branch see note D2 for further information on 1 January 2014, the unallocated surplus of the Hong Kong with-profits business is reported within the Asia insurance operations segment from this date.
In addition, the related policyholder liabilities are classified as being part of the non-UK regulated funds.
The shareholders share of realistic liabilities adjustment to the regulatory basis is only applicable to the UK regulated with-profits fund.
ii Excluding PAC shareholders equity that is included in parent company and shareholders equity of other subsidiaries and funds.
iii The term shareholders equity held in long-term funds refers to the excess of assets over liabilities attributable to shareholders of funds which are required by law to be maintained ring-fenced with segregated assets and liabilities.
iv For regulatory purposes the Jackson surplus notes are accounted for as capital.
v Other adjustments to shareholders equity and unallocated surplus include amounts for the value of non-participating business for UK regulated with-profits funds, deferred tax, admissibility and other items measured differently on the regulatory basis.
For Jackson the principal reconciling item is deferred tax related to the differences between IFRS and regulatory basis as shown in the table above and other methodology differences.
vi Principally includes unit-linked and similar contracts in the UK and GIC liabilities of Jackson.
vii The investment and policyholder liabilities valuation difference between IFRS and regulatory bases for Jackson is mainly due to not all investments being carried at fair value under the regulatory basis and also due to the valuation difference on annuity reserves.

c  Total available capital for the Groups life assurance operations has changed as follows: m OtherUK lifeassurance Asialife subsidiaries assurance Group WPSF andfunds Jackson subsidiaries total note i note iii note ii note iv  8,000 2,708 2,903 1,802 15,413 Changes in assumptions 89 53 60 96 Changes in management policy 100 100 note v Other factors including new business 611 536 238 3,081 3,244  7,200 3,297 3,141 4,823 18,461 Notes i With-profits sub-fund The decrease in 2014 of 800 million reflects primarily the transfer of the available capital for the Hong Kong with-profits business to Asia life assurance subsidiaries following the completion of the Hong Kong branch domestication on 1 January 2014 and the negative impact of decreasing yields, partially offset by the positive impact of investment returns earned on the opening available capital.
ii Jackson The increase of 238 million in 2014 reflects an underlying increase of 57 million applying the 2014 year end exchange rate of US$1.56: 1.00 and 181 million of exchange translation gain.
iii Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The increase in 2014 of 589 million includes the effect of the transfer of the available capital for the Hong Kong non-participating business to the Asia life assurance subsidiaries.
Excluding this effect, the increase principally comprises value movement on assets backing surplus capital due to reduction in interest rates and other investment related profits.
iv Asia life assurance subsidiaries The increase of 3,021 million in 2014 reflects an underlying increase of 2,991 million applying the relevant 2014 year end exchange rates and 30 million of exchange translation gain.
The underlying increase of 2,991 million reflects primarily the transfer of the available capital of the Hong Kong business from the UK operations on 1 January 2014 and its increase during the year.
v Other factors comprise the effect of changes in new business, valuation interest rate, investment return, foreign exchange and other factors.
In 2014, the net movement of 3,244 million includes the effect of the difference between the regulations in the UK and Hong Kong as applied to the calculation of the amounts of the available capital for the Hong Kong business transferred between the two operations on 1 January 2014.
250 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C11:  d Basisofpreparation,  Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
Details by the Groups major operations are shown below.
i Asia insurance operations The available capital shown above of 4,823 million 2013: 1,802 million represents the excess of local regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of required capital of 1,514 million 2013: 699 million.
The 2014 available capital and required capital for Asia insurance operations include the amounts for the Hong Kong with-profits and non-participating business following its domestication as described further below.
The businesses in Asia are subject to local capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
The Hong Kong business branch of PAC was transferred to separate subsidiaries established in Hong Kong following the completion of the process of the domestication of the Hong Kong business on 1 January 2014 see note D2.
Prior to 2014, the Hong Kong business branch of PAC and its capital requirements were subsumed within those of the PAC long-term fund.
From 2014, the Hong Kong business is solely regulated by the relevant regulators in Hong Kong and its local available capital and capital requirements are shown within the Asia insurance operations in this note.
For material Asian operations, the details of the basis of determining regulatory capital and regulatory capital requirements are as follows: Hong Kong As mentioned above, the Hong Kong business branch of PAC was domesticated on 1 January 2014 and the resulting companies Prudential Hong Kong Limited PHKL, for long-term business, and Prudential General Insurance Hong Kong Limited PGHK, for General Insurance business, were established.
For non-participating business, mathematical reserves are generally calculated using a modified net premium approach with no allowance for future discontinuance.
The underlying assumptions are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations.
Cash flows are discounted at a valuation interest rate based on a blend between the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and the reinvestment rate.
For participating business, mathematical reserves are based on the guaranteed benefits only and use a modified net premium approach with no allowance for future discontinuances.
Similar to above, the underlying assumptions are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations with the valuation interest rate being a blend of the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and the reinvestment rate.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with the non-unit reserves calculated in accordance with the standard actuarial methodology and prevailing regulations.
The capital requirement for solvency margin calculation varies by underlying risk and duration of liabilities but is generally determined as 4 per cent of mathematical reserves plus 0.3 per cent of the capital at risk.
Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 120 per cent of solvency capital.
Policy reserves for traditional business are determined on a gross premium reserve basis using prudent best estimate assumptions.
For linked business, the value of the units are maintained with a non-unit reserve which is calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Korea A risk-based capital framework applies in Korea.
Policy reserves for traditional business are determined on a net premium reserve basis using standard mortality and prescribed standard interest rates.
For linked business, the value of the units are held together with the non-unit reserves and calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
In accordance with the local risk-based capital framework, insurers are expected to maintain a level of free surplus in excess of the capital requirements.
Malaysia A risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed and non-guaranteed benefits determined using best estimate assumptions is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of a gross premium reserve on the guaranteed benefits, determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions for risk margin for adverse deviations.
For linked business the value of units is held together with a non-unit reserve calculated in accordance with standard actuarial methodology.
Participating fund surplus is not allowed to be used to support a deficit if any and the capital requirement of the non-participating business.
The capital requirement is calculated based on a prescribed series of risk charges.
The local regulator has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 251 Singapore A risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore.
For participating business, a gross premium reserve, determined using prudent best estimate assumptions and which makes allowance for future bonus, is held.
The amount held is subject to a minimum of the higher of the assets attributed to participating business and a gross premium reserve calculated on specified assumptions, but without allowance for future bonus, that include prescribed provisions for adverse deviations PADs.
For non-participating business, gross premium reserves are held.
A registered insurer incorporated in Singapore is required at all times to maintain a minimum level of paid-up ordinary share capital and to ensure that its financial resources are not less than the greater of i the total risk requirement arising from the assets and liabilities of the insurer calculated in accordance with the Singapore Insurance Act: or ii a minimum amount of 5 million Singapore Dollars.
The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate.
Thailand A risk-based capital framework applies in Thailand.
For non-participating business, the gross premium reserves are determined using best estimate assumptions along with provisions of risk margin for adverse deviations discounted at the risk-free rate.
The risk-free rate is derived from the greater of the current yield curve of Thai government bonds and the weighted-average yield curve of the current and prior seven quarters of Thai government bonds, as with a greater weighting on the current quarter.
Life insurers are required by law to maintain capital funds which are not less than the greater of i the sum of capital for all risks and asset as prescribed in the regulation and ii a minimum amount of 50 million Thai Baht.
Vietnam For traditional business, mathematical reserves are calculated using a modified net premium approach, set using assumptions agreed with the regulator.
For linked business, the value of units is held together with the non-unit reserves calculated in accordance with the local regulators standard actuarial methodology.
The capital requirement is determined as 4 per cent of reserves plus a specified percentage of 0.1 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term less than or equal to five years or 0.3 per cent of sums at risk for policies with original term of more than five years.
An additional capital requirement of Vietnamese Dong 200 billion is also required for companies transacting unit-linked business.
ii US insurance operations The regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC approved Risk-Based Capital standards.
Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard that they calculate by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and separate model based calculations of risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
The Risk-Based Capital formula takes into account the risk characteristics of a company, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk.
The available capital of Jackson shown above of 3,141 million 2013: 2,903 million reflects US regulatory basis available capital as adjusted to exclude asset valuation reserves.
The asset valuation reserve, which is reflected as available capital, is designed to provide for future credit-related losses on debt securities and losses on equity investments.
Available capital includes a reduction for the effect of the interest maintenance reserve, which is designed by state regulators to defer recognition of non-credit related realised capital gains and losses and to recognise them ratably in the future.
Jacksons Risk-Based Capital ratio is significantly in excess of regulatory requirements.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice, net of tax, was to decrease statutory surplus by 356 million at 31 December 2014.
Michigan insurance law specifically allows value of business acquired as an admitted asset as long as certain criteria are met.
US NAIC standards limit the admitted amount of goodwill value of business acquired generally to 10 per cent of capital and surplus.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson reported 242 million of statutory basis value of business acquired as a result of the REALIC acquisition, which is fully admissible under Michigan insurance law.
iii UK insurance operations In the UK, the insurers, regulated by PRA, must hold capital resources equal at least to the Minimum Capital Requirement MCR.
In addition, the rules require insurers to perform Individual Capital Assessments.
Under these rules insurers must assess for themselves the amount of capital needed to back their business.
If the PRA views the results of this assessment as insufficient, it may draw up its own Individual Capital Guidance for a firm, which can be superimposed as a requirement.
252 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C11:  PAC with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund Under PRA rules, insurers with with-profits liabilities of more than 500 million must hold capital equal to the higher of the MCR and the Enhanced Capital Requirement ECR.
The ECR is intended to provide a more risk responsive and realistic measure of a with-profit insurers capital requirements, whereas the MCR is broadly speaking equivalent to the previous required minimum margin under the Interim Prudential Sourcebook and satisfies the minimum EU Standards.
Determination of the ECR involves the comparison of two separate measurements of the firms resources requirement, which the PRA refers to as the twin peaks approach.
The two separate peaks are: i The requirement comprised by the mathematical reserves plus the Long-Term Insurance Capital Requirement LTICR, together known as the regulatory peak: and ii A calculation of the realistic present value of the insurers expected future contractual liabilities together with projected fair discretionary bonuses to policyholders, plus a risk capital margin, together known as the realistic peak.
Available capital of the with-profits sub-fund and Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund of 7.2 billion 2013: 8.0 billion represents the excess of assets over liabilities on the PRA realistic basis.
Unlike the previously discussed FRS 27 basis, realistic liabilities on the regulatory basis include the shareholders share of future bonuses.
These amounts are shown before deduction of the risk capital margin which is estimated to be 1.0 billion at 31 December 2014 2013: 0.9 billion.
The PRAs basis of setting the risk capital margin is to target a level broadly equivalent to a Standard & Poors credit rating of BBB and to judge this by ensuring there are sufficient assets to absorb a one in 200 year event.
The risk capital margin calculation achieves this by setting rules for the determination of margins to cover defined stress changes in asset values and yields for market risk, credit risk and termination risk for with-profits policies.
PAC has discretion in its management actions in the case of adverse investment conditions.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary bonuses, crediting rates and total claim values.
Other UK life assurance subsidiaries and funds The available capital of 3,297 million 2013: 2,708 million reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities of the subsidiaries and funds, before deduction of the capital resources requirement of 1,552 million 2013: 1,364 million.
The capital resources requirement for these companies broadly reflects a formula which, for active funds, equates to a percentage of regulatory reserves plus a percentage of death strains.
Death strains represent the payments made to policyholders upon death in excess of amounts explicitly allocated to fund the provisions for policyholders claims and maturities.
iv Group capital requirements In addition to the requirements at individual Company level, PRA requirements under the IGD apply additional prudential requirements for the Group as a whole.
Discussion of the Groups estimated IGD position at 31 December 2014, together with market risk sensitivity disclosure provided to key management, is provided in the Strategic Report section of the Groups 2014 Annual Report.
Following ratification of the Solvency II Omnibus II Directive on 16 April 2014, Solvency II is expected to come into force on 1 January 2016 and will replace the existing IGD capital requirements.
e  For PAC and all other UK long-term insurers, long-term business assets and liabilities must, by law, be maintained in funds separate from those for the assets and liabilities attributable to non-life insurance business or to shareholders.
Only the established surplus, the excess of assets over liabilities in the long-term fund determined through a formal valuation, may be transferred so as to be available for other purposes.
Distributions from the with-profits sub-fund to shareholders reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
Accordingly, the excess of assets over liabilities of the PAC long-term fund is retained within that company.
The retention of the capital enables it to support with-profits and other business of the fund by, for example, providing the benefits associated with smoothing and guarantees.
It also provides investment flexibility for the funds assets by meeting the regulatory capital requirements that demonstrate solvency and by absorbing the costs of significant events or fundamental changes in its long-term business without affecting the bonus and investment policies.
For other UK long-term business subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels which provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the regulatory minimum.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year-end statutory surplus require prior regulatory approval.
For Asia subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ring-fenced with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to the UK, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency targets.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable to the life assurance businesses after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above basis liabilities.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 253 f  Prudential manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities Prudential has in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory requirements in which it operates, Prudential employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, Jackson and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, US and Asian regulators.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
For example, for businesses that are most sensitive to interest rate changes, such as immediate annuity business, Prudential uses cash flow analysis to create a portfolio of debt securities whose value is expected to change in line with the value of liabilities when interest rates change.
This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates and is used in the UK for annuity business and by Jackson for its fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities and institutional products.
For businesses that are most sensitive to equity price changes, Prudential uses stochastic modelling and scenario testing to look at the future returns on its investments under different scenarios which best reflect the large diversity in returns that equities can produce.
This allows Prudential to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy that, based on the model assumptions, allows it to optimise returns to its policyholders and shareholders over time while maintaining appropriate financial strength.
Prudential uses this methodology extensively in connection with its UK with-profits business.
g  Should the assets of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund, the PAC long-term fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.
C11.2  Certain asset management subsidiaries of the Group are subject to regulatory requirements.
The movement in the year of the surplus regulatory capital position of those subsidiaries, combined with the movement in the IFRS basis shareholders funds for unregulated asset management operations, is as follows:  2014 m 2013 m M&Gincluding Prudential Eastspring Capital US Investments Total Total  Beginning of year 309 134 129 572 513 Gains during the year 296 20 80 396 424 Movement in capital requirement 26 8 34 4 Capital injection 1 1 8 Distributions made to the parent company 342 5 62 409 365 Exchange movement 8 8 4 End of year 238 157 139 534 572
