328 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Additional information Additional unaudited financial information Additional unaudited financial information continued II: Other information continued d Reconciliation of expected transfer of value of in-force VIF and required capital business to free surplus The tables below show how the VIF generated by the in-force long-term business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over the next 40 years.
Although a small amount less than 2 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting, so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2014, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2014 over the same 40-year period.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging after 2054.
Following their sale, the cash flows exclude any cash flows in respect of Japan and PruHealth and PruProtect.
The above amounts can be reconciled to the new business amounts as follows: 2014 m New business Asia US UK Total Undiscounted expected free surplus generation for years 2015 to 2054 3,582 1,594 773 5,949 Less: discount effect 2,111 532 451 3,094 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2015 to 2054 1,471 1,062 322 2,855 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2054 91 2 93 PruHealth and PruProtect free surplus generation for new business not included above 19 19 note 13 Less: Free surplus investment in new business 346 187 73 606 Other items 54 181 235 note 13 Post-tax EEV new business profit 1,162 694 270 2,126 In November 2014, the Group disposed of its stake in the PruHealth and PruProtect businesses for an EEV profit of 44 million.
New business profit for the year includes new business written by the businesses prior to the disposed date.
For the analysis above, such profits have been excluded as the Group has realised the cash through sale in 2014.
Other items represent the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange effects and other non-modelled items.
Foreign exchange effects arise as EEV new business profit amounts are translated at average exchange rates and the expected free surplus generation uses year end closing rates.

At 31 December 2014, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years years 2015 to 2019 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as those underpinning our embedded value reporting was 11.4 billion, an increase of 1.7 billion from the 9.7 billion expected over the same period at the end of 2013.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2014, which is expected to generate 1,379 million of free surplus over the next five years.
Operating, non-operating and disposal of our share of PruHealth and PruProtect businesses and other items are expected to decrease free surplus generation by 70 million over the next five years, which is more than offset by the favourable foreign exchange movements of 345 million.
At 31 December 2014, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 47.1 billion, up from the 43.5 billion expected at end of 2013, reflecting the effect of new business written across all three business operations and a positive foreign exchange translation effect arising in the US and Asia operations of 1.2 billion.
These positive effects have been offset by a 1.7 billion adverse effect reflecting operating, market assumption changes and the disposal of our share of PruHealth and PruProtect businesses and other items.
These principally reflect the impact of falling interest rates, particularly in Asia.
The overall growth in the undiscounted value of free surplus reflects our ability to write both growing and profitable new business.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2014 from life business in force at the end of 2014 was 2.7 billion including 0.3 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2014 realisation at the end of 2013 of 2.2 billion.
See note 8 and note 14 of the EEV basis results section for further details.
These relate to items where there is no definitive timeframe for when the payments will be made or receipts received and are, consequently, excluded from the amounts incorporated into the tables above showing the expected generation of free surplus from in-force business at 31 December 2014.
