There are also unfunded defined benefit plans in the US, Sweden and Germany and a funded defined benefit plan in Ireland.
UK defined benefit plan The UK defined benefit plan is based on revalued career average earnings for members.
It is governed by a board of trustees which is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy.
The plan was closed to new entrants in 2011.
The duration of the plans liabilities is approximately 20 years.
The trustees are drawn partly from nominees of Rexam PLC, which also appoint the chairman, and partly from the plans membership, as member nominated trustees.
It is Rexams expectation that the composition of the trustees will remain at 50% member nominated, excluding the chairman of the trustees.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REXAM ANNUAL REPORT 2014 133 25 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The plan is subject to a statutory funding objective, as set out in UK pensions legislation.
The trustees must obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met, and whether a recovery plan is needed to restore funding to the level of the technical provisions.
A full actuarial valuation by a qualified actuary was carried out as at 31 March 2014.
The preliminary results of that valuation have been used to calculate the liabilities on an accounting basis as at 31 December 2014.
The results are currently in the process of being finalised by the trustees and Rexam.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out no later than 31 March 2017.
In 2012 the trustees agreed a six year escrow investment with contributions of 10m in 2012 and 15m for each of the following five years.
At each subsequent valuation date, the assets in escrow will either be allocated to the plan, to Rexam PLC or remain in escrow depending on the funding position of the plan.
If there is a change of control with a subsequent material decline in Rexams credit rating or a material deterioration in Rexams financial covenant, the escrow would be paid into the plan.
An extension to the escrow arrangement beyond 2017 is currently being discussed alongside the 2014 actuarial valuation results.
On an accounting basis at 31 December 2014 the plan was 104% funded 2013: 99%.
In 2009, Rexam PLC entered into a security agreement with the trustees, granting the plan a charge over the UK beverage can facilities and machinery at Milton Keynes and Wakefield which is enforceable up to 31 December 2017 in the event of a contribution default or a material decline in Rexams financial covenant.
Investment strategy is the responsibility of the trustees, with implementation powers delegated to an investment committee.
This investment committee includes employer representatives.
A strategy has been agreed to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, with planned regular switches from growth assets into bonds.
The switches may be accelerated under certain market conditions and triggers apply based on both funding level and market indices.
Hedging covering 80% of interest rate risk and 80% of inflation risk is currently in place.
The plan has been gender equalised following the European Barber equalisation regulations in 1990, although Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs held in the plan in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme between 1978 and 1997 have not themselves been equalised, as the UK government is yet to confirm how GMP equalisation is to be achieved.
US defined benefit plan The US defined benefit plan is based on final average pay or flat dollar benefits to union and non union hourly members.
Benefits were frozen for salaried members in 2006.
The duration of the plans liabilities is approximately 10 years.
Plan oversight is provided by the US pension and benefits committee and the US investment committee, which are responsible for its management, administration, funding and investment strategy.
Both committees consist entirely of employees of the Group, nominated by Rexam Inc, a subsidiary of Rexam PLC.
A full actuarial valuation by a qualified actuary is carried out annually, the latest being as at 1 January 2014.
This valuation determines the plans funding ratio and calculates the minimum required contributions for the year ahead based on US government requirements.
The minimum contributions reflect the normal cost for benefits expected to be earned in the upcoming year, expected plan expenses including premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and additional contributions required to bring plan funding to 100%, typically over a seven year period.
The calculations reflect the fair value of plan assets and actuarial liabilities based on government prescribed discount rates and mortality assumptions.
At 1 January 2014, the ratio of plan assets to actuarial liabilities on the government funding basis equalled 103% 2013: 107%.
The minimum required contributions for the 2014 plan year were $14.5m 2013: $nil.
In 2014, $50m was paid into the plan 2013: $50m and it is expected that this level of funding will continue in the medium term.
On an accounting basis at 31 December 2014 the plan was 81% funded 2013: 83%.
The US investment committee has been designated by Rexam Inc as a named fiduciary of the trust assets.
It adopted a strategy to minimise funded status volatility by matching at least 90% of the movement in the plan liabilities due to interest rate and credit spread fluctuations while generating returns consistent with the liability growth rate.
As part of the strategy, in 2014 the plan achieved a 15% equity exposure 2013: 15%, mainly through derivatives.
The multiple fixed income managers employed by the investment committee invest predominantly in corporate and government bonds as their primary objective is to avoid securities that will be downgraded or will default, with a secondary objective of outperforming their mutually agreed benchmarks.
Other defined benefit plans The Group also operates unfunded plans in the US, Sweden and Germany and a funded plan in Ireland.
Their legal status and control varies depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
At 31 December 2014, the net liability of all these plans on an accounting basis was 111m 2013: 91m.
The past service credit of 2m in 2013 was in respect of the Irish plan and resulted from conversion from a final salary to a career average plan.
Risk management The Groups retirement benefit risk management for defined benefit pension plans is overseen by the Rexam retirement benefits committee.
This committee manages pension deficit volatility on the balance sheet and general risks within the plans, including equity, interest rate and inflation risk.
In general, trustees or similar bodies manage the defined benefit plans and set the required contribution rates based on independent actuarial advice in accordance with local regulations.
The Group seeks to actively mitigate the risks associated with its plans.
The Group seeks a good working relationship with the trustees through regular meetings and pension matters are regularly reported to the Rexam Board.
The trustees cannot unilaterally wind up the plans nor do they have unilateral power to demand contributions or set contribution rates without employer consent.
There are no significant risks of immediate debt payments to the plans and there is no self investment.
There is a risk that changes in discount rates, price inflation, asset returns or mortality assumptions could lead to a material deficit.
Given the long term time horizon of the pension plan cash flows, the assumptions used are uncertain.
The assumptions can also be volatile from year to year due to changes in investment market conditions.
A higher pension deficit could directly impact the Groups equity valuation, credit rating and may lead to additional funding requirements in future years.
Any deficit relative to the actuarial liability for funding purposes, which may differ from the funding position on an accounting basis, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are reasonably affordable to Rexam PLC and in line with local regulations.
Contingent contribution payment commitments from the escrow account may also become more likely.

These tables are adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the plan membership.
The life expectancy assumed for a 65 year old pensioner is 87.2 years 2013: 87.1 years for a male and 89.4 years 2013: 89.3 years for a female.
The life expectancy for a non pensioner currently aged 45 is 89.0 years 2013: 88.9 years for a male and 91.2 years 2013: 91.1 years for a female.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the US pension plans for 2014 are as follows.
Pre retirement mortality is based on MRP-2007 tables with generational projection using scale MSS-2007.
Post retirement mortality is based on the Mercer Industry Longevity Experience Study MILES-2010 combined collar tables for Auto, Industrial Goods and Transportation AIGT companies, with one year set forward for females and with generational projection using scale MSS-2007 applied from 2010.
The life expectancy assumed for a 65 year old pensioner is 85.5 years for a male and 87.1 years for a female.
The life expectancy for a non pensioner currently aged 40 is 87.0 years for a male and 88.5 years for a female.
In 2013, the mortality assumptions used were based on the RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2023, weighted 70% blue collar and 30% white collar.
The life expectancy assumed for a 65 year old pensioner was 84.1 years for a male and 86.0 years for a female.
The UK defined benefit pension plan discount rate assumption for 2014 is based on the single equivalent discount rate implied by the Mercer Yield Curve, UK Extended Dataset model.
In 2013, the discount rate was based on the single equivalent discount rate implied by the Mercer Yield Curve, UK Index Constituents model.
This Extended Dataset model has been adopted because it is more stable and sustainable.
The impact of this change was to reduce the 2014 present value of defined benefit pension obligations by 36m.
There was no impact on the 2014 consolidated income statement.
The Group expects to contribute 44m in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in 2015, excluding any amounts paid into escrow.
IFRIC 14 IAS19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction had no impact on the Group in 2014 or 2013. iii Other pension plans The Group operates defined contribution plans in the UK and US, included as part of other pensions in i above, for which the charge in the consolidated income statement for the year was 3m for continuing operations and 1m for discontinued operations 2013: 4m and 2m and total cash contributions were 4m 2013: 6m.
136 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED iv Retiree medical The Group operates a defined benefit retiree medical and life insurance plan in the US for certain segments of the retiree population.
Plan oversight is provided by the US pension and benefits committee.
Before reaching Medicare eligibility generally age 65, the plan provides benefits similar to medical coverage as for active employees, but generally with a higher level of participant contributions.
After Medicare eligibility is reached, most retirees receive a flat dollar allowance to help with the cost of privately purchased benefits or with government Medicare contributions.
There is a risk that changes in discount rates and life expectancy assumptions could lead to a material increase in liabilities for plan benefits.
These unfunded benefits are assessed with the advice of a qualified actuary.

In 2013, the mortality assumptions used were based on the RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2023, weighted 85% blue collar and 15% white collar.
The life expectancy assumed for a 65 year old pensioner was 83.9 years for a male and 85.8 years for a female.
Healthcare cost trend rates do not have a significant impact on the Group with respect to retiree medical.
