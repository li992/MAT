Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2013 14 121 11 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.11 PENSIONS 11.11.1 CARE scheme The Company operates three defined benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benefits based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benefits based on either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Schemes.
The CARE Schemes are generally not open to new members.
The Retirement saver plan RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation.
The latest full actuarial valuations are being carried out as at 1 April 2013 for the Safeway Scheme and 5 April 2013 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The preliminary results of these valuations have been used and updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the period to 2 February 2014 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Group has previously entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it has contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP valued at 90m as at 31 January 2013 to the CARE schemes.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis and an accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes qualify as assets for FRS 17 purposes.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 3.3m during the year ending 2 February 2014, and will make annual contributions of 6.6m for a further 19 years.
11.11.2 Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
Financial 2014 2013 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.70% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.30% to 3.50% 2.30% to 3.70% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.50% 4.85% Inflation assumption RPI CPI 3.50% 2.70% 3.70% 2.90% Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2014 2013 Male 24.7 24.5 Female 25.6 25.4 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2014 2013 Male 22.3 22.1 Female 23.2 23.1 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year-old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as long cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up-to-date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2013: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.

11.11.3 Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2014 2013 m m Equities 339 310 Bonds 228 196 Gilts 2 Liability driven investments 218 208 Scottish Limited Partnership 29 30 Cash 1 1 Total market value of assets 817 745 Present value of scheme liabilities 805 717 Net pension asset 12 28 Related deferred tax liability 3 2 Net pension asset after deferred tax 9 26 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2014 2013 m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 745 638 Expected return on scheme assets 41 30 Actuarial gain 19 37 Employer contributions 18 48 Employee contributions 5 5 Benefits paid 11 13 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 817 745 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2013 14 123 11 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.11 PENSIONS CONTINUED The movement in the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the period was as follows: 2014 2013 m m Defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period 717 638 Current service cost 16 17 Employee contributions 5 5 Other finance income 35 31 Actuarial loss 43 39 Benefits paid 11 13 Defined benefit obligation at the end of the period 805 717 11.11.4 Sensitivities Below is listed the impact on the liabilities of changing key assumptions whilst holding other assumptions constant: 2014 2013 m m Discount factor 0.1% 20 18 Longevity 1 year 25 22 11.11.5 profit and loss account impact The following amounts have been charged in arriving at operating profit in respect of pension costs: 2014 2013 m m Current service cost 16 17 The amounts for current service cost and pensions credit have been charged in the following profit and loss account lines: 2014 2013 m m Cost of sales 13 14 Administrative expenses 3 3 16 17 The following amounts have been included in other finance income: 2014 2013 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 41 30 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 35 31 6 1 11.11.6 Amounts recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses The amounts included in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL were: 2014 2013 m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 19 37 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 7 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 36 39 Actuarial loss recognised in the STRGL 24 2 Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2013 14 Financial statements 124 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCONTINUED 52 weeks ended 2 February 2014 11 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.11 PENSIONS CONTINUED 2014 2013 m m Cumulative gross actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 190 166 Taxation on cumulative actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 38 38 Cumulative net actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL 152 128 The actual return on scheme assets can therefore be summarised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Expected return on scheme assets 41 30 Actuarial movement recognised in the STRGL reflecting the difference between expected and actual return on assets 19 37 Actual return on scheme assets 60 67 The expected return on scheme assets was determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
