A deferred tax asset of 1.3m 2013: 1.6m has not been recognised in respect of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be appropriate taxable profits available in the short-term against which these can be utilised.
d. Factors that may affect future tax charges Based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
As a property group, tax and its treatment is often an integral part of transactions.
The outcome of tax treatments are recognised by the Group to the extent the outcome is reasonably certain.
Where tax treatments have been challenged by HMRC, ormanagement believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based on the information available at the Balance Sheet date.

The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with acceptable generally A and above credit ratings.

Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.

The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 1.6m 2013: 1.6m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 0.6m 2013: 0.5m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.

St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 2014 77 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued th for the year ended 30 November 2014 18.
PENSIONS The Group operates a UK based pension scheme, the St. Modwen Pension Scheme, with both defined benefit and defined st contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, to future accrual.
The Income Statement includes: a charge of 0.2m 2013: 0.2m for the defined benefit section: and a charge of 0.6m 2013: 0.6m for the defined contribution section.
The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Ltd.
It is regulated by the UK regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
th The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2014, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 38m, a funding level of 97% based on the trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 5.6% pa post-retirement 3.8% pa Increase in pensions 2.7% pa As the scheme is almost fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such an th extent as to cover administrative expenses only.
The expected contribution for year ended 30 November 2015 is expected to be 0.2m, consistent with the current year 0.2m.
th The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2014 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19.
The majorassumptions used by the actuary were: 2014 2013 2012 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.1% 2.6% 2.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment th Pre 6 April 1997 benefits 3.0% 3.0% 2.7% th Post 5 April 1997 benefits 3.1% 3.4% 2.7% Discount rate 3.6% 4.5% 4.3% Inflation assumption 2.1% 2.6% 2.0% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is st no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from the Hymans Robertson Scheme Specific VITA Tables with an underpin to future improvements of 1% per annum.
The cohort effect is assumed to have peaked and improvements remain flat at the oldest ages.
The resultant assumptions are, for example: th Average future life expectancy in years for a pensioner aged 65 at 30 November 2014: 23.0 male, 23.8 female.
th Average future life expectancy in years at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30 November 2014: 23.9 male, 26.1 female.

A one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.9m to 29.5m.
Defined benefit scheme risk factors The Group is exposed to a number of risks related to its defined benefit scheme, the most significant of which are detailed below.
Asset volatility Pension scheme liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields.
If the assets within the scheme deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme.
This risk is reduced by holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets bonds or similar.
As the scheme matures, it is anticipated that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities.
The asset portfolio includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities and vice-versa.
ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKING In 2010, the Group entered into an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of Branston Properties Ltd Branston, ofwhich Simon Clarke is a shareholder, at market value.
The price paid for the option was 0.1m with exercise contingent on the achievement of certain planning milestones in relation to land held by Branston.
nd Following achievement of these planning milestones the option was exercised by the Group on 22 May 2014 and 87.5% of the issue share capital of Branston was acquired.
A conditional agreement to acquire the remaining 12.5% of the issued share capital, nd which is held by Simon Clarke, was also entered into on 22 May 2014.
Total consideration payable for the entire issued capital of Branston was: 0.8m on completion: 0.1m payable on shareholder approval: 0.1m 12 months after completion: and Contingent consideration payable based on the level of future development gains achieved in respect of the land and property held by Branston.
Based on the provisional fair values detailed below, no contingent consideration has been recognised.
The consideration payable to Mr. Clarke under the conditional agreement equates to 12.5% of the amounts above.
As the consideration payable to Mr. Clarke is in excess of 100,000, the conditional agreement constitutes a substantial property transaction with a director of the Company under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006.
As a result, the agreement is conditional, among other things, on approval of shareholders of St. Modwen Properties PLC: this approval will be sought at the th Companys Annual General Meeting to be held on 27 March 2015.
As required by IFRS3 2008 Business Combinations, this acquisition has resulted in the assets and liabilities of Branston being remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date.
Fair values are reported as provisional for 12 months to allow the incorporation ofany subsequent amendments and the negative goodwill arising has been credited to the Income Statement.
