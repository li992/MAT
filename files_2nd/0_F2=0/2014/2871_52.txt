The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate that recognises their CGU specific characteristics and is based on the overall Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The major assumptions in this extrapolation are: growth rates applied to the year 1 cash flows: the pre-tax discount rates to be used: and the long term growth rate used for the terminal value calculation.
Growth rates The growth rate assumptions are particular to each CGU and are derived from external research across the breadth of our markets which is provided by Ovum, a third party provider.
These projections are reviewed by senior management to ensure that they are in line with their understanding of the markets in which they operate.
Capita plc 134 Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15 Goodwill continued Pre-tax discount rates The Group WACC is calculated by weighting the cost of our debt and equity financing in line with the amounts of debt and equity that we use to finance our activities.
We have calculated our post-tax WACC assuming a risk-free rate of 1.75%, a market risk premium of 8.3% and a Beta of 0.8.
These assumptions are based on publicly available sources.
The Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7.2% 2013: 7.7% has been used as a basis for calculating the discount rate used for each CGU.
This has been done by adjusting the rate, where appropriate, to reflect the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
The rate adjustment takes into account the relative risks in the business through adjustment to the risk premium and the weighting of the funding levels provided per CGU, whilst retaining a constant cost of debt.
Long term growth rates The terminal value included in the calculation is based on the Year 5 cash flow and the pre-tax discount rate for the CGU adjusted for a long term growth factor which is set at an estimate of the long term rate of inflation of 2.3% 2013: 2.0%.
Below is a table setting out the growth and pre-tax discount rates used in the calculations described above.
Third party market growth rates Pre-tax WACC 2014 2013 2014 2013 Insurance Services 4.4% 4.3% 9.6% 10.4% Life & Pensions Services 5.4% 5.5% 9.6% 10.0% Customer Management & International 3.8% 3.6% 8.4% 9.9% IT & Software Services 3.1% 2.2% 9.0% 10.1% Secure Information Solutions 4.6% 4.6% 9.5% 10.0% Property Services 2.1% 1.3% 10.2% 11.1% Workplace Services 4.6% 4.8% 8.7% 9.4% Non-significant CGUs Range 2.1% 6.8% Range 1.3% 7.1% Range 7.9% 12.4% Range 7.9% 11.5% Sensitivity analysis The impairment testing as described is reliant on the accuracy of managements forecasts and the assumptions that underlie them and also on the selection of the discount and growth rates to be applied.
In order to gauge the sensitivity of the result to a change in any one, or combination of the assumptions that underlie the model, a number of scenarios have been run to measure which CGUs are the most susceptible to an impairment should the assumptions used be varied.
The sensitivity analysis on CGU cash flows has been carried out using a 100bps increase in the pre-tax discount rate, a 100bps reduction in growth rates, and a 100bps decrease in CGU year 1 operating margins between 2% and 33% impact on margins depending on CGU.
The Insurance Services CGU, as reported previously, is the most sensitive to a change in a single or combination of assumptions and therefore profit and profit margins are closely monitored.
The headroom in the base case impairment test is 4m: the key assumptions driving this are stated above, together with a year 1 operating margin of 13%.
The resulting impairment of goodwill of a 100bps adverse change in: the operating margin is 13m: the discount rate 4m: the growth rates applied 4m: and a combination of a 100bps adverse change in all, would be 41m.
Other smaller CGUs, which are not material to the Group, are also sensitive to changes in the assumptions, but movements would be immaterial.
Management continue to monitor closely the performance of all CGUs.
In conclusion, other than disclosed above with regard to Insurance Services and some smaller CGUs, management believe there is no reasonably possible change in the underlying assumptions that would result in a CGU becoming impaired and thus recognising an impairment charge in the Income Statement.
