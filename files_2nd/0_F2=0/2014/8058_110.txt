This will create distributable reserves on the balance sheet which will provide Indivior with, among other things, capacity for the payment of future dividends.
As required under s645 of the Companies Act, the High Court of Justice has confirmed the reduction of the Companys share capital.
Following the registration of the Order of the Court with Companies House, the capital reduction became effective on January 21, 2015.
