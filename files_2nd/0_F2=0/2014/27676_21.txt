Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, and The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of Old Mutual plc and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Julian Roberts Ingrid Johnson Group Chief Executive Group Finance Director 27 February 2015 120 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF OLD MUTUAL PLC ONLY For the year ended 31 December 2014 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Old Mutual plc for the year ended 31 December 2014, which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes which include the reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to profit after tax.
In our opinion: The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, and The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: Loans and advances 34,857 million Refer to page 84 Audit Committee Report, pages 136 to 137 and 163 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes A3, E1, E2 and E3 to the financial statements.
The risk: The Groups loans and advances impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgement and the use of subjective assumptions.
Due to the significance of loans and advances and the related estimation uncertainty, this is considered to be a key audit risk, both in respect of the mature, established clusters and the unsecured lending books within Nedbank, as well as the Emerging Markets exposure through the newly consolidated Old Mutual Finance.
Our response: For all banking clusters, our procedures included testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls in operation over the loan approval, administration and monitoring processes.
We involved our own internal valuation specialists to assess each of the portfolio loan loss provisioning models employed by the Group and to compare the Groups assumptions to externally available data in relation to key inputs such as historical default rates, recovery rates, collateral valuation, and economic growth rates.
We also performed detailed testing over the specific provisions held against loans and advances, by inspecting latest correspondence and Credit Committee minutes to inform our work and challenge assumptions where necessary, assessing collateral values and re-performing key calculations.
Policyholder liabilities 79,679 million Refer to page 84 Audit Committee Report, pages 137 to 138 and 188 to 191 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes A3, E1, E2, and E8 to the financial statements.
The risk: The main risk associated with policyholder liabilities is in respect of the insurance contracts within the life businesses: Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth.
Judgement is required over the variety of uncertain future outcomes, including the policy for creating and releasing discretionary margins.
Economic assumptions, such as investment return, discount rates, and operating assumptions, such as mortality and persistency, are the key inputs used to estimate the valuation of these long-term liabilities.
Our response: Our procedures in this area included testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the identification, measurement and management of the Groups calculation of insurance liabilities and evaluation of the consistency of methodologies and the appropriateness of the assumptions used by the Group.
We involved our own internal actuarial specialists to assist us in our challenge of the assumptions used and the process followed for setting and updating these assumptions, particularly around persistency, expense and mortality morbidity assumptions.
This included checking the appropriateness of the data used in managements analysis prepared to set the assumptions.
Our challenge was provided in the context of our own industry knowledge, external data and our views of experience to date, an understanding of which was enhanced through our attendance at the Groups own Independent Review Committee meetings.
In respect of the discretionary reserves held within the South African business we checked and challenged the Groups use and application of the established policy, with reference to industry-wide practice and applicable accounting standards.
Old Mutual plc 121 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF OLD MUTUAL PLC ONLY continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 Goodwill and intangibles 2,763 million Refer to page 85 Audit Committee Report, page 201 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes F1 to the financial statements.
The risk: Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant audit caption on the balance sheet and the determination of the recoverable amount of intangible assets both acquired and internally generated and goodwill is complex and typically requires a high level of judgement, taking into account the different economic environments in which the Group operates.
The most significant judgements arise over the forecast cash flows and the discount rate applied in the value-in-use valuation models.
We consider that the greatest risk is within Old Mutual Wealth but significant goodwill also exists in Institutional Asset Management and the balance will increase as the Group pursues acquisitions.
Our response: Our procedures included challenging the cash flow forecasts and the corresponding assumptions, such as discount rates, applied by the Group in the consideration of potential impairment of intangible assets, based on our understanding of the relevant business and the industry and economic environment in which it operates.
We compared forecasts to business plans and also previous forecasts to actual results to assess the performance of the business and the accuracy of forecasting and considered the appropriateness of the scenarios used, in the context of our wider business understanding.
We involved our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group, in particular those relating to the discount rates and in evaluating these assumptions with reference to inputs we derived ourselves.
Taxation 200 million Refer to page 84 Audit Committee Report, page 138 accounting policy and the disclosures in notes F7 & H4 to the financial statements.
The risk: Accruals for uncertain tax positions require the Group to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax exposures and in response to enquiries and challenges raised by the tax authorities.
This is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on due to the Group operating in a number of different tax jurisdictions and the complexities of and developments in international tax legislation, particularly in relation to South Africa given the proportion of the Groups income earned there.
Our response: In understanding the accruals held, we inspected the correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and associated advice and held discussions with relevant members of management.
We involved our own local and international tax specialists to assist us in analysing the Groups tax positions and challenged positions taken by the Group in determining tax provisions based on our knowledge and experiences of the application of the international and local legislation by relevant authorities and courts.
For all of the risk areas set out above, we have assessed whether the Groups disclosures about the sensitivity of the relevant financial statement items to changes in the respective key assumptions appropriately reflect the associated risks and comply with the requirements of relevant accounting standards.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 80 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation.
Materiality represents 5.2% of Group profit before tax.
In normalising the benchmark, we considered certain of the Groups AOP adjustments.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 4 million in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Groups six business units we subjected all to audits for Group reporting purposes, being the Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank, Institutional Asset Management, Bermuda and Group Head Office businesses.
The component audit teams at each of the business units undertook their own scoping exercises, with oversight from the Group team, to ensure sufficient audit coverage to support their own reporting to the Group team.
Our work covered 93% of total revenues, 99% of profit before tax and 92% of total Group assets.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The Group audit team approved the component materialities which ranged from 32 million to 65 million, having regard for the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.
To support the audit instructions sent to our component teams, the Group audit team visited five component locations in South Africa, the US, Bermuda and elsewhere in the UK for planning and risk assessment meetings and maintained regular communication with the auditors at these locations throughout the audit cycle to discuss work progress and identify matters of relevance to our audit of the Group financial statements.
At these visits and meetings, the status of any issues being reported to the Group audit team was discussed in detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
The Senior Statutory Auditor, in conjunction with other senior staff in the Group audit team, also attended Audit Committee meetings held at the significant components to understand key risks and audit issues at a component level which may affect the Group financial statements.

Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Basis of preparation of adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit AOP reflects the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
AOP is a measure of profitability which adjusts the IFRS profit measures for the specific items detailed in note C1 and, as such, it is a non-GAAP measure.
The reconciliation set out above explains the differences between AOP and profit after tax as reported under IFRS.
For core life assurance and property & casualty businesses, AOP is based on a long-term investment return, including returns on investments held by life funds in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For all core businesses, AOP excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of accounting for intangibles acquired in a business combination and costs related to completed acquisitions, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, profit loss on acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, fair value profits losses on certain Group debt instruments and costs related to the fundamental restructuring of continuing businesses.
AOP includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Old Mutual Bermuda and Nordic are treated as non-core and discontinued operations in the AOP disclosure.
As such they are not included in AOP.
Refer to note B1 for further information on the basis of segmentation.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as AOP.
It is stated after tax attributable to AOP and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates and joint ventures other than those held by life assurance funds which are accounted for as investments.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies adopted by the Company and Group, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss or as available-for-sale, owneroccupied property and investment property.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of the previous carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
The Parent Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with these accounting policies, other than for investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates, which are stated at cost less impairments see note E1 m, in accordance with IAS 27.
The Company and Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate having taken into consideration the points as set out in the Directors Report in the section headed Going concern.
Judgements made by the directors in the applications of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note A3.
Translation of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into the Groups presentation currency using the year-end exchange rates, and their income and expenses using the average exchange rates.
Other than in respect of cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2004, cumulative unrealised gains or losses resulting from translation of functional currencies to the presentation currency are included as a separate component of shareholders equity.
To the extent that these gains and losses are effectively hedged, the cumulative effect of such gains and losses arising on the hedging instruments are also included in that component of shareholders equity.
Upon the disposal of subsidiaries the cumulative amount of exchange differences deferred in shareholders equity, net of attributable amounts in relation to net investments, is recognised in profit or loss.
Cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2004, being the effective date of the Groups conversion to IFRS, were reset to zero.
The exchange rates used to translate the operating results, assets and liabilities of key foreign business segments to pounds sterling are: Year ended 31 December 2014 Year ended 31 December 2013 Statement Statement Income of financial Income of financial statement position statement position average rate closing rate average rate closing rate Rand 17.8712 17.9976 15.0959 17.4284 US dollars 1.6474 1.5581 1.5650 1.6566 Euro 1.2399 1.2877 1.1782 1.2014 Developments during 2014 Other than changes arising from new accounting developments as mentioned in note A5, the Group has not made any changes to the accounting policies during the year.

A3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the preparation of these financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and judgements that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, statement of financial position, other primary statements and related supporting notes.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which involve the most complex or subjective judgements or assessments.
Where applicable the Group applies estimation and assumption setting techniques that are aligned with relevant actuarial and accounting guidance based on knowledge of the current situation.
This requires assumptions and predictions of future events and actions.
There have been no significant methodology changes to the critical accounting estimates and judgements that the Group applied at 31 December 2014.
The significant accounting policies are described in the relevant notes.
The key areas of the Groups business that typically require such estimates and the relevant accounting policies and notes are as follows: Area Policy note More detail Financial assets and liabilities E1 E4 Life assurance contract provisions E8 E8 Deferred acquisition costs E8 F3 Intangible assets and goodwill F1 F1 Consolidation A3 d G3 Tax A3 c D1 F7 Specific areas that have required closer attention in respect of the estimates and judgements during the year ended 31 December 2014 are explained in more detail below: a Loans and advances Provisions for impairment of loans and advances The majority of loans and advances are in respect of Nedbank, which assesses its loan portfolios for impairment at each financial reporting date.
Nedbank actively manages its exposure to loans and advances through robust credit approval processes.
The credit loss ratio at year ended 31 December 2014 was 0.79% 2013: 1.06%.
The impairment for performing loans is calculated on a portfolio basis, based on historical loss experience, adjusted for national and sector specific economic conditions and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the portfolio.
These include early arrears, such as changes in macro-economic conditions and legislation affecting credit recovery.
These annual loss ratios are applied to loan balances in the portfolio and scaled to the estimated loss emergence period.
For portfolios of loans and advances which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on the portfolio, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
There are a number of models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or client category.
Judgement and knowledge are needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
Additional impairment provisions may be raised for issues which the Group believes is not specifically covered by statistical models.
136 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials For wholesale larger exposures impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account.
The level of impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculations of future cash flows and change with time as new information becomes available or as strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment provision as individual decisions are taken.
Emerging Markets has lending exposure in South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe through non-wholly owned subsidiaries of 909 million 2013: 255 million.
Credit loss ratios are monitored on each individual business unit and have generally improved in the current year.
Further detail is provided in note E3.
b Policyholder liabilities Emerging Markets discretionary reserves Technical provisions in South Africa are determined as the aggregate of: Best estimate liabilities, with assumptions allowing for the best estimate of future experience and a market-consistent valuation of financial options and guarantees Compulsory margins, prescribed in terms of the Long Term Insurance Act, 1988 and South African professional actuarial guidance note SAP 104 as explicit changes to actuarial assumptions that increase the level of technical provisions held, and Discretionary margins, permitted by the Long Term Insurance Act, 1988 and SAP 104, to allow for the uncertainty inherent in estimates of future experience after considering available options of managing that experience over time, or to defer the release of profits consistent with policy design or company practice.
Discretionary margins are held as either implicit or explicit margins.
Explicit discretionary margins are derived as conscious changes to assumptions used to project future experience to increase technical provisions.
Implicit discretionary margins arise where the method used to calculate overall technical provisions results in liabilities that are greater than the sum of best estimate liabilities and compulsory margins.
Explicit discretionary margins of 459 million 1.7% of total technical provisions were held at 31 December 2014 2013: 489 million, 1.9% of total technical provisions.
This consisted largely of: Margins held for Mass Foundation Cluster protection business, which allow for the uncertainty related to mortality experience in South Africa, as well as future lapse experience and future investment returns, and to ensure that profit is released appropriately over the term of the policies Margins to allow for the uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to value financial options and guarantees, implied volatility assumptions in particular, which are difficult to hedge due to the short term nature of the equity option market in South Africa Margins on non-profit annuities, due to the inability to fully match assets to liabilities as a result of the limited availability of long-dated bonds, and to provide for longevity risk and A margin set up in 2013 to allow for the uncertainty inherent in future economic assumptions used to calculate, mainly protection product liabilities, in the Retail Affluent business.
Although interest rate hedging is used to manage interest rate risk on these products, the volatility of bond yields in South Africa means that it is difficult to maintain appropriate hedging positions without incurring significant trading costs.
The discretionary margin therefore caters for the residual uncertainty present after allowing for the hedge programme that is in place.
A similar margin was set up for the Mass Foundation Cluster savings book in 2014.
Emerging Markets Financial Soundness Valuation discount rate The calculation of the Groups South African life assurance contract liabilities is sensitive to the discount rate used to value the liabilities.
The methodology applied by the Group requires discount rates to be set according to the South African professional guidance note SAP 104.
In line with these principles, the reference rate is selected as the Bond Exchange of South Africa BESA par bond 10-year yield.
The reference rate was relatively volatile over 2014, ranging from 7.6% to 9.0% during the year ended 31 December 2014 2013: 6.2% to 8.5%.
At 31 December 2014 the reference discount rate was 8.0% 2013: 8.1%.
The volatile interest rate environment continued to have a negligible impact on the operating profit for the South African life assurance businesses in 2014, given the continuance of the hedging program and discretionary margins put in place to mitigate these impacts.
The Group estimates that a 1% reduction in the reference discount rate will result in an increase in policyholder liabilities of 2 million 2013: 6 million, allowing for the impact of the hedging programme.
Further disclosure of the policyholder sensitivity to interest rates is provided in note E8 g. Old Mutual plc 137 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 A: Significant accounting policies continued A3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Old Mutual Bermuda guarantees Since the closure of Old Mutual Bermuda to new business in March 2009, managements key priorities have been to fide-risk the business, manage the risk and solvency position and preserve shareholder value.
The run-off of the book and hedging of the guarantees has significantly reduced the Groups risk exposure.
The active contracts for which reserves are recognised are deferred and fixed index annuity investments and variable annuity products, which include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits GMAB and guaranteed minimum death benefits GMDB.
The key risk to the Group relates to the GMAB policies which were sold with Universal Guarantee Options UGOs.
UGOs guarantee policyholders the return of 120% of invested premiums and, subject to policyholder election, they may include a Highest Anniversary Value HAV guarantee.
These guarantees are effective on the 10 year anniversary of policies, which will be reached in 2017 and 2018.
The risk attaching to the guarantee of 120% of invested premium, and relating to equity and foreign exchange downside risks, is managed by a dynamic tail hedging strategy, which progressively increases hedge coverage if the value of underlying policyholder investments decreases.
The Old Mutual Bermuda business has also implemented a series of structured look back options for the HAV risk of markets rising above the 120% guarantee and then subsequently falling below 120%, having reset the guarantees amount above 120%.
GMAB reserves have reduced from $84 million at 31 December 2013 to $82 million at 31 December 2014.
There are no significant risks to the Group associated with GMDB and management continues to operate strong oversight over the business.
c Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income tax necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
At any given tiAhme the Group typically has a number of open tax returns with various tax authorities and engages in active dialogue to resolve this.
Provisions relating to these open items are recognised based on the Groups estimate of the most likely outcome, after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact profit or loss, current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period such determination is made.
d Consolidation set of standards The Group has applied the following key judgements in the application of the requirements of the consolidation set of standards IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements : Consolidation of investment funds and securitisation vehicles The Group acts as a fund manager to a number of investment funds.
In determining whether the Group controls such a fund, it will focus on an assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group comprising any carried interests and expected management fees and the investors rights to remove the fund manager.
The Group assesses, on an annual basis, such interests to determine if the fund will be consolidated.
See note G3 b for disclosures in respect of the investment funds in which the Group has an interest.
The Group has sponsored certain asset backed financing securitisation vehicles under its securitisation programme which are run according to pre-determined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles.
The Group is exposed to variability of returns from the vehicles through its holding of junior debt securities in the vehicles.
It has concluded that it controls these vehicles and therefore has consolidated these asset backed financing vehicles.
Structured entities The Group is required to make judgements on what constitutes a structured entity.
Accounting standards define a structured entity as an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such investees in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the investee, its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, the nature of its relationship with the investee and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the investee.
The Group has evaluated all exposures and has concluded that all investments in investment funds as well as certain securitisation vehicles and other funding vehicles represent investments in structured entities.
A4: Liquidity analysis of the statement of financial position The Groups statement of financial position is in order of liquidity as is permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
In order to satisfy the requirements of IAS 1, the following analysis is given to describe how the statement of financial position lines are categorised between current and non-current balances, applying the principles laid out in IAS 1.
The following statement of financial position captions are generally classified as current: cash and cash equivalents, non-current assets held for sale, client indebtedness for acceptances, current tax receivable, third-party interests in the consolidation of funds, current tax payable, liabilities under acceptances and non-current liabilities held for sale.
The following balances are generally classified as non-current: goodwill and other intangible assets, mandatory reserve deposits with central banks, property, plant and equipment, investment property, deferred tax assets, investments in associated undertakings and jointly controlled operations, deferred acquisition costs, deposits held with reinsurers, provisions, deferred revenue and deferred tax liabilities.
138 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials The following balances include both current and non-current portions: reinsurers shares of life assurance policyholder liabilities and property & casualty business liabilities, loans and advances, investments and securities, other assets, derivative financial assets and liabilities, life assurance policyholder liabilities and property & casualty liabilities, borrowed funds, amounts owed to bank depositors and other liabilities.
The split between the current and non-current portions for these assets and liabilities is given either by way of a footnote to the relevant note to the accounts or by way of a maturity analysis in respect of major financial liability captions.
A5: Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations adopted in the 2014 annual financial statements The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been adopted in these financial statements: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Amendments to IAS 36 IFRIC 21 Levies The adoption of these standards did not have any impact on the Group financial statements.
A6: Future standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not early-adopted in the 2014 annual financial statements At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for how an entity should classify and measure financial assets, requires changes to the reporting of own credit with respect to issued debt liabilities that are designated at fair value, replaces the current rules for impairment of financial assets and amends the requirements for hedge accounting.
Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities IFRS 9 requires that an entitys business model and a financial instruments contractual cash flows will determine its classification and therefore its measurement in the financial statements.
Upon assessment each financial asset will be classified as either fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, amortised cost, or fair value through Other Comprehensive Income FVOCI.
As these requirements are different than the assessments under the existing IAS 39 rules, some differences to classification and measurement of financial assets are to be expected.
The classification and measurement of financial liabilities remain largely unchanged under IFRS 9 from current requirements.
However, where issued debt liabilities are designated at fair value, the fair value movements attributable to an entitys own credit risk will be recognised in Other Comprehensive Income rather than in the Consolidated income statement under IFRS 9.
Impairment of financial assets The impairment rules under IFRS 9 will apply to those financial assets that are measured at amortised cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI.
Impairment will move from a model whereby credit losses are recognised when a trigger event occurs under IAS 39 to an expected loss model, where provisions are taken upon initial recognition of the financial asset based on expectations of potential credit losses at that time.
The allowance for credit losses provided for on initial recognition will be based on a 12-month expected credit loss basis.
Subsequently, should the probability of default of the issuer increase significantly, the expected credit loss of the financial asset over its lifetime lifetime expected losses will be recognised as an additional provision.
As a result of the changes to impairment rules, IFRS 9 will result in an increase in subjectivity as provisions will be based on forward-looking, probability-weighted information that is continuously monitored and incorporated over the life of the financial asset.
This is in contrast to impairment recognition that is based on credit events that have already occurred under IAS 39.
IFRS 9 is expected to result in an increase in the overall level of impairment allowances, due to the likelihood that there will be a larger population of financial assets to which lifetime expected losses applies as compared to the population of financial assets for which credit events have already occurred under IAS 39.
Hedge accounting IFRS 9 also incorporates new hedge accounting rules that intend to align hedge accounting with risk management practices.
Generally, some restrictions under current rules have been removed and a greater variety of hedging instruments and hedged items become available for hedge accounting.
Effective date IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 which is expected to have the largest impact on the Groups banking operations.
The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Old Mutual plc 139 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 A: Significant accounting policies continued A6: Future standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not early-adopted in the 2013 annual financial statements continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which specifies how and when revenue is recognised, but does not impact income recognition related to financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9 or IAS 39.
IFRS 15 replaces several other IFRS standards and interpretations that currently govern revenue recognition under IFRS and provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
The standard also requires entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative and relevant disclosures.
IFRS 15 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
B: Segment information B1: Basis of segmentation The Groups segmental results are analysed and reported on a basis consistent with the way that management and the Board of directors of Old Mutual plc assesses performance of the underlying businesses and allocates resources.
Information is presented to the Board on a consolidated basis in pounds sterling the presentation currency and in the functional currency of each business.
Adjusted operating profit AOP is one of the key measures reported to the Groups management and Board of directors for their consideration in the allocation of resources to and the review of performance of the segments.
As appropriate to the business line, the Board reviews additional measures to assess the performance of each of the segments.
These typically include sales, net client cash flows, funds under management, gross earned premiums, underwriting results, net interest income, non-interest revenue and credit losses.
A reconciliation between segment revenues and expenses and the Groups revenues and expenses is shown in note B3.
Consistent with internal reporting, assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated between segments where appropriate and where there is a reasonable basis for doing so.
The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices.
Given the nature of the operations, there are no major trading activities between the segments.
The revenues generated in each reported segment can be seen in the analysis of profits and losses in note B3.
The segmental information in notes B3 and B4, reflects the adjusted and IFRS measures of profit or loss and the assets and liabilities for each operating segment as provided to management and the Board of directors.
There are no differences between the measurement of the assets and liabilities reflected in the primary statements and that reported for the segments.
There are four primary business activities from which the Group generates revenue.
These are life assurance premium income, asset management business fee and commission income, banking banking interest receivable and investment banking income and property & casualty premium income.
Other revenue includes gains and losses on investment securities.
The principal lines of business from which each operating segment derives its revenues are as follows: Core operations Emerging Markets life assurance, property & casualty, asset management and banking Nedbank banking, asset management and life assurance Old Mutual Wealth life assurance and asset management Institutional Asset Management asset management Non-core operations Old Mutual Bermuda life assurance 140 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Segment presentation The results of the property & casualty business were previously disclosed separately.
However, following changes in management oversight, these have been included in the Emerging Markets segment with effect from 1 January 2014.
This change has been applied to all periods presented and comparative information has been re-presented accordingly.
The USAM segment has been renamed to Institutional Asset Management and consists of OM Asset Management plc, a listed subsidiary of the Group and Rogge Global Partners plc, a fixed income asset management affiliate of the Group.
There have been no other changes to the presentation of segment information.
The Groups reported segments are now Emerging Markets, Nedbank, Old Mutual Wealth and Institutional Asset Management.
The Other segment includes Group Head Office.
For all reporting periods, Old Mutual Bermuda is classified as a continuing operation in the IFRS income statement, but as non-core in determining the Groups AOP.
As set out in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, the Group continues to incur costs related to the sale of its Nordic business in 2012.
These costs largely relate to the transition of IT information and support services that were previously provided by the Nordic business to the wider Group, back to the Group.
These costs are included in the expenses related to the discontinued operations in the IFRS consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 and as non-core for determining the Groups AOP for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Further information on the results of discontinued operations is provided in note I1.
All other businesses have been classified as continuing operations for all reporting periods.

2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 C: Other key performance information C1: Operating profit adjusting items a Summary of adjusting items for determination of adjusted operating profit AOP In determining the AOP of the Group for core operations, certain adjustments are made to profit before tax to reflect the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
The following table shows an analysis of those adjustments from AOP to profit before and after tax.
m Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December Notes 2014 2013 Expense income Goodwill impairment and impact of acquisition accounting C1 b 128 141 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments C1 c 2 4 Short-term fluctuations in investment return C1 d 49 6 Investment return adjustment for Group equity and debt instruments held in life funds C1 e 42 100 Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities C1 f 32 42 Institutional Asset Management equity plans C1 g 42 38 Credit-related fair value losses on Group debt instruments C1 h 10 31 Restructuring costs C1 i 60 20 Total adjusting items 301 286 Tax on adjusting items D1 d 36 46 28 Non-controlling interest in adjusting items 20 Total adjusting items after tax and non-controlling interests 237 220 b Goodwill impairment and impact of acquisition accounting When applying acquisition accounting, deferred acquisition costs and deferred revenues existing at the point of acquisition are not recognised under IFRS.
These are reversed on acquisition in the statement of financial position and replaced by goodwill, other intangible assets and the value of the acquired present value of in-force business acquired PVIF.
In determining AOP, the Group recognises deferred revenue and acquisition costs and deferred revenue in relation to policies sold by acquired businesses pre-acquisition.
The Group excludes the impairment of goodwill and the amortisation and impairment of acquired other intangibles and acquired PVIF as well as movements in certain acquisition date provisions.
Costs incurred on completed acquisitions are also excluded from AOP.
If the intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are subsequently impaired, this is excluded from AOP.
The effect of these adjustments to determine AOP are summarised below: m Emerging Old Mutual Year ended 31 December 2014 Markets Wealth Total Amortisation of acquired PVIF 3 67 70 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 11 11 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 7 47 54 Change in acquisition date provisions 1 1 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 14 14 Goodwill impairment and impact of acquisition accounting 10 118 128 m Emerging Old Mutual Year ended 31 December 2013 Markets Wealth Total Amortisation of acquired PVIF 76 76 Amortisation of acquired deferred costs and revenue 11 11 Amortisation of other acquired intangible assets 2 46 48 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 8 20 28 Goodwill impairment and impact of acquisition accounting 10 131 141 150 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials c Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments is analysed below: m Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 Emerging Markets 66 Old Mutual Wealth 70 Institutional Asset Management 2 4 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments 2 4 Emerging Markets On 30 April 2014, following the termination of the management agreement with SA Corporate Real Estate Fund, a JSE listed real estate trust, the Group agreed to sell and transfer the business to the new manager once the transaction became unconditional.
A profit of 4 million has been recognised in profit or loss.
On 1 September 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of an additional 25% stake in Old Mutual Finance Pty Ltd.
Consequently a profit of 62 million has been realised on the transaction, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the initial 50% and the carrying amount of the investment in Old Mutual Finance Pty Ltd at 1 September 2014.
Old Mutual Wealth On 30 May 2014, the Group completed the disposal of Skandia Poland, part of Old Mutual Wealth.
A loss on disposal of 21 million has been recognised profit or loss.
On 1 October 2014, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of Skandia Austria and Skandia Germany.
On 6 November 2014, the Group completed the sale of Skandia Liechtenstein.
A loss on disposal of 6 million has been recognised in profit or loss.
Institutional Asset Management During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group received additional earn-out income of 2 million from affiliates disposed of in the prior year.
On 2 January 2013, the Group completed the sale of five of its affiliates and recognised a loss of 1 million.
On 11 October 2013, Institutional Asset Management committed to a plan to cease the operations of Echo Point.
The incremental cost of 3 million associated with discontinuing the entity was recognised in full during October 2013. d Short-term fluctuations in investment return Profit before tax, as disclosed in the consolidated IFRS income statement, includes actual investment returns earned on the shareholder assets of the Groups life assurance and property & casualty businesses.
AOP is stated after recalculating shareholder asset investment returns based on a long-term investment return rate.
The difference between the actual and the long-term investment returns is referred to as the short-term fluctuation in investment return.
Long-term rates of return are based on achieved rates of return appropriate to the underlying asset base, adjusted for current inflation expectations, default assumptions, costs of investment management and consensus economic investment forecasts.
The underlying rates are principally derived with reference to 10-year government bond rates, cash and money market rates and an explicit equity risk premium for South African businesses.
The rates set out below reflect the apportionment of underlying investments in cash deposits, money market instruments and equity assets.
Long-term rates of return are reviewed frequently by the Board, usually annually, for appropriateness.
The review of the long-term rates of return seeks to ensure that the returns credited to AOP are consistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long term.
For Emerging Markets, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets, adjusted for net fund flows.
For Old Mutual Wealth, the return is applied to average investible assets.

These include investments in the Companys ordinary shares and the subordinated liabilities and ordinary shares issued by the Group.
These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax in the IFRS income statement, but are included in AOP.
This ensures consistency of treatment with the measures in the related policyholder liability.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the investment return adjustment increased AOP by 42 million year ended 31 December 2013: increase of 100 million.
f Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities Dividends declared to the holders of the Groups perpetual preferred callable securities on an AOP basis were 32 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 year ended 31 December 2013: 42 million.
For the purpose of determining AOP, these are recognised in finance costs on an accrual basis.
In accordance with IFRS, the total cash distribution is recognised directly in equity.
g Institutional Asset Management equity plans Institutional Asset Management has a number of long-term incentive arrangements with senior employees in its asset management affiliates.
The Group has issued put options over the equity of certain affiliates to senior affiliate employees, as part of its Institutional Asset Management incentive schemes.
The impact of revaluing these instruments is recognised in accordance with IFRS, but excluded from AOP.
At 31 December 2014, these instruments were revalued, the impact of which was a loss of 42 million year ended 31 December 2013: loss of 38 million.
h Credit-related fair value losses on Group debt instruments The widening of the credit spread on the Groups debt instruments causes the market value of these instruments to decrease, resulting in gains being recognised in profit or loss.
Conversely, if the credit spread narrows the market value of debt instruments increases causing losses to be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In the directors view, such movements are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and will reverse over time.
Therefore they have been excluded from AOP.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, due to narrowing of credit spreads, a net loss of 10 million was recognised year ended 31 December 2013: net loss of 31 million.
i Old Mutual Wealth restructuring expenditure The Old Mutual Wealth business embarked on a significant programme of operational change in 2013.
This will fundamentally restructure the way in which its UK platform business operates.
Over the next two years, it will migrate certain elements of service provision to International Financial Data Services IFDS.
Costs related to decommissioning of existing technology and service provision and the migration of service to IFDS are excluded from AOP.
These costs comprise payments to IFDS and directly attributable internal project costs and totalled 60 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 year ended 31 December 2013: 20 million.
152 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials C2: Earnings and earnings per share The Group calculates earnings per share EPS on a number of different bases as appropriate to prevailing international, UK and South African practices and guidance.
IFRS requires the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.
Adjusted operating EPS reflects earnings per share that is consistent with the Groups alternative profit measure.
JSE Limited JSE listing requirements also require the Group to calculate headline EPS.
The Groups EPS on these different bases are summarised below: Pence Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December Source of guidance Notes 2014 2013 Basic earnings per share IFRS C2 a 12.4 15.0 Diluted basic earnings per share IFRS C2 b 11.5 13.9 Adjusted operating earnings per share Group policy C2 c 17.9 18.4 Headline earnings per share Gross of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 12.3 15.6 Headline earnings per share Net of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 12.6 15.2 Diluted headline earnings per share Gross of tax JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 11.4 14.4 JSE Listing Requirements C2 d 11.6 14.1 Diluted headline earnings per share Net of tax a Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding own shares held in policyholder funds, Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts ESOP, Black Economic Empowerment trusts and other related undertakings.

As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in certain African territories, dividends to ordinary equity holders on the branch registers of those countries or in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.
A final dividend of 6.25 pence or its equivalent in other applicable currencies per ordinary share in the Company has been recommended by the directors.
The final dividend will be paid on 29 May 2015 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 17 April 2015 for the South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Malawi registers and 22 April 2015 for the UK register.
The dividend will absorb an estimated 293 million of shareholders funds.
The Company is not planning to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
In March and November 2014, 17 million and 15 million respectively, were declared and paid to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities March 2013: 22 million, November 2013: 25 million.

E: Financial assets and liabilities E1: Group statement of financial position The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets investments and loans, financial liabilities investment contracts, customer deposits and borrowings, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
The key focus of financial risk management for the Group is ensuring that the proceeds from its financial assets are sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and banking operations.
The most important components of financial risk are credit risk, market risk arising from changes in equity, bond prices, interest and foreign exchange rates and liquidity risk.
a Recognition and derecognition A financial asset or liability is recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when, and only when: The contractual rights to the cash flows arising from the financial assets have expired or been forfeited by the Group: or It transfers the financial asset including substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset: or It transfers the financial asset and neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control.
A financial liability is derecognised when, and only when, the liability is extinguished.
That is, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, assigned, cancelled or has expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part thereof extinguished or transferred to another party and consideration received, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the timeframe established by regulation or market convention regular way purchases and sales are recognised at trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans and receivables are recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs when cash is advanced to borrowers.
b Initial measurement Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
c Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are included in investment income or finance costs as appropriate.
Old Mutual plc 161 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued d Hedge accounting Qualifying hedging instruments must either be derivative financial instruments or non-derivative financial instruments used to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in fair value or changes in cash flows.
Changes in the value of the financial instrument should be expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item.
The Group designates certain qualifying hedging instruments as either 1 a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment fair value hedge or 2 a hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction, and could affect profit or loss cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Hedge accounting is used for qualifying hedging instruments designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria in accordance with reporting standards for a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a hedge include: Upfront formal documentation of the hedging instrument, hedged item or transaction, risk management objective and strategy, the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness measurement methodology that will be applied is prepared before hedge accounting is adopted The hedge is documented showing that it is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the risk management and strategy detailed in the upfront hedge documentation The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured The hedge is assessed and determined to have been highly effective on an ongoing basis For cash flow hedges of a forecast transaction, an assessment that it is highly probable that the hedged transaction will occur and will carry profit or loss risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that prove to be highly effective in relation to hedged risk, are recorded in profit or loss, along with the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to that specific hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
For fair value hedge accounting, any previous adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument carried at amortised cost as a result of previous hedge accounting, is amortised in profit or loss from the date hedge accounting ceases, to the maturity date of the financial instrument, based on the effective interest method.
For hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, any cumulative gains or losses in equity are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
e Embedded derivatives Certain derivatives embedded in financial and non-financial instruments, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond, are treated as separate derivatives and recognised as such on a standalone basis, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses reported in profit or loss.
If it is not possible to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative, the entire hybrid instrument is categorised as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value.
f Offsetting financial instruments and related income Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expense items are offset only to the extent that their related instruments have been offset in the statement of financial position, with the exception of those relating to hedges, which are disclosed in accordance with profit or loss effect of the hedged item.
g Interest income and expense Interest income and expense in relation to financial instruments carried at amortised cost or held as available-for-sale are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, taking into account the expected timing and amount of cash flows.
Interest income and expense include the amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences between the initial carrying amount of an interest-bearing instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective interest basis.
Interest income and expense on financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are presented as part of interest income or expense.
h Non-interest revenue Non-interest revenue in respect of financial instruments principally comprises fees and commission and other operating income.
These are accounted for as set out below.
162 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Fees and commission income Loan origination fees, for loans that are probable of being drawn down, are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective yield on the loan.
Fees and commission arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third-party, such as the acquisition of loans, shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction.
Other income Revenue other than interest, fees and commission including fees and insurance premiums, which includes exchange and securities trading income, dividends from investments and net gains on the sale of banking assets, is recognised in profit or loss when the amount of revenue from the transaction or service can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction or service will flow to the Group.
i Financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-tomaturity or available-for-sale.
An analysis of the Groups statement of financial position, showing the categorisation of financial assets, together with financial liabilities is set out in note E1 o. j Classification of financial instruments Held-for-trading financial assets Held-for-trading financial assets are those that were either acquired for generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealers margin, or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists, or are derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss Financial assets that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through profit or loss are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis for instance with respect to financial assets supporting insurance contract provisions or are managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis for instance financial assets supporting shareholders funds.
All financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, whether held-for-trading or designated, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value based on bid prices quoted in active markets.
If such price information is not available for these instruments, the Group uses other valuation techniques, including internal models, to measure these instruments.
These techniques use market observable inputs where available, derived from similar assets and liabilities in similar and active markets, from recent transaction prices for comparable items or from other observable market data.
For positions where observable reference data are not available for some or all parameters, the Group estimates the non-market observable inputs used in its valuation models.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate used is a market-related rate at the reporting date for an instrument with similar terms and conditions.
Fair values of certain financial instruments, such as over-the-counter OTC derivative instruments, are determined using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, yield curves, credit spreads, and volatility factors.
Realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on all financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are included in investment return non-banking or in banking trading, investment and similar income as appropriate.
Interest earned whilst holding financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is reported within investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within investment return nonbanking or banking trading, investment and similar income, when a dividend is declared.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, other than those classified by the Group as fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Third-party expenses such as legal fees incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction.
Held-to-maturity financial assets Financial assets with fixed maturity dates which are quoted in an active market and where management has both the intent and the ability to hold the asset to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
These assets are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Interest earned on held-to-maturity financial assets is reported within investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Available-for-sale financial assets Financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices other than those designated fair value through profit or loss or as loans and receivables, are classified as available-for-sale.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value based on bid prices quoted in active markets.
If such prices are unavailable or determined to be unreliable, the fair value of the financial asset is estimated using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on observable market data where available at the reporting date.
Old Mutual plc 163 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued j Classification of financial instruments continued Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When available-for-sale financial assets are disposed, the related accumulated fair value adjustments are included in profit or loss as gains and losses from available-for-sale financial assets.
When available-for-sale assets are impaired the resulting loss is shown separately in profit or loss as an impairment charge.
Interest earned on available-for-sale financial assets is reported within investment return non-banking or banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within investment return non-banking or banking trading, investment and similar income, as appropriate when a dividend is declared.
Financial liabilities other than investment contracts and derivatives Non-derivative financial liabilities, including borrowed funds, amounts owed to depositors and liabilities under acceptances, are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through profit or loss or as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Liabilities that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through profit or loss are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis or are managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis.
For financial liabilities recorded at fair value and which contain a demand feature, the fair value of the liability is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.
Financial liabilities categorised at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which is normally represented by the transaction price less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Equity classified conversion options included within financial liabilities are recorded separately in shareholders equity.
The Group does not recognise any change in the value of this option in subsequent periods.
The remaining obligation to make future payments of principal and interest to bondholders is calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond and is presented on the amortised cost basis in other borrowed funds until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of a liability and the consideration paid is included in other income.
k Reclassifications of financial assets A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was required to be categorised as held-for-trading on the basis that it was held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
If a financial asset is so reclassified, it is reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification.
Any gain or loss already recognised in profit or loss is not reversed.
The fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its new cost or amortised cost, as applicable.
Other non-derivative financial assets that were required to be categorised as held-for-trading at initial recognition may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in rare circumstances.
Measurement of the asset after reclassification depends on the subsequent categorisation.
A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was designated as availablefor-sale may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category if it meets the loans and receivables definition at the date of reclassification and if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
In the case of a financial asset with a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life using the effective interest method together with any difference between the new amortised cost and the maturity amount.
In the case of a financial asset that does not have a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is recognised in profit or loss when the financial asset is sold or otherwise disposed.
l Sale and repurchase agreements and lending of securities Securities sold subject to linked repurchase agreements are retained in the financial statements as appropriate when considering the fiderecognition criteria contained within IAS 39.
The securities that are retained in the financial statements are reflected as trading or investment securities and the counterparty liability is included in amounts owed to other depositors, deposits from other banks, or other money market deposits, as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell at a pre-determined price are recorded as loans and advances to other banks or customers as appropriate.
The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the lives of agreements using the effective interest method.
164 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Securities lent to counterparties are retained in the financial statements and any interest earned recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the purchase and sale are recorded with the gain or loss included in trading income.
The obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
m Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are recorded at cost.
Impairments of Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are accounted for in the same way as impairments of other non-financial assets.
n Impairments of financial assets Indicators of impairment A provision for impairment is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all amounts relating to the financial asset.
Observable data that could come to the attention of the Group that could lead to a provision for impairment to be made include: Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the counterpartys financial difficulty, grants to the counterparty a concession that the Group would not otherwise consider It becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets, including: adverse changes in the payment status of counterparties in the group of financial assets: or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the group of financial assets.
In addition, for an available-for-sale financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets at amortised cost The amount of the impairment of a financial asset held at amortised cost is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the value of expected cash flows, including amounts recoverable from guarantees and collateral, discounted based on the effective interest rate at initial recognition.
In estimating future expected cash flows, the Group looks at the contractual cash flows of the assets and adjusts these contractual cash flows for historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks, with this adjusted to reflect any additional conditions that are expected to arise or to account for those which no longer exist.
This is done to predict inherent losses which exist in the asset as at the reporting date but have not been reported.
The impairment provision also covers losses where there is objective evidence that losses are present in components of the loan portfolio at the reporting date, but these components have not yet been specifically identified.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written-off against the related impairment provision.
If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after the write-down, the release of the impairment provision is credited to profit or loss.
Impairment reversals are limited to what the carrying amount would have been had no impairment losses been recognised.
Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognised on the impaired amount using the original effective interest rate before the impairment.
Available-for-sale financial assets The amount of the impairment loss of an available-for-sale financial asset is the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, being the difference between the acquisition cost and the assets current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale debt securities, fair value is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of interest.
All such impairments are recognised in profit or loss.
The release of an impairment allowance in respect of a debt instrument categorised as available-for-sale is credited to profit or loss, the release in respect of an equity instrument categorised as available-for-sale is credited to the available-for-sale reserve within equity.

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price.
That is, the fair value of the consideration given or received.
In certain circumstances, however, the initial fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique whose variables include only observable data.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets, which in certain circumstances includes using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services, and offer prices for liabilities.
When quoted prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that refer as far as possible to observable market data.
These include comparison with similar instruments where market observable prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
A number of factors such as bid-offer spread, credit profile, servicing costs and model uncertainty are taken into account, as appropriate, when values are calculated using a valuation technique.
Changes in the assumptions used in such valuations could impact the reported value of such instruments.
All derivative instruments are measured at fair value.
In general, none of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost have a fair value significantly different to their carrying amounts.
Such assets and liabilities primarily comprise variable-rate financial assets and liabilities that re-price as interest rates change, short-term deposits or current assets.
All financial assets and liabilities that are measured at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
The following is taken into account when evaluating the fair value of financial instruments: Assessing whether instruments are trading with sufficient frequency and volume, that they can be considered liquid The inclusion of a measure of the counterparties non-performance risk in the fair-value measurement of loans and advances, which involves the modelling of dynamic credit spreads The inclusion of credit valuation adjustment CVA and debit valuation adjustment DVA in the fair-value measurement of derivative instruments, with particular emphasis on DVA and The inclusion of own credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of financial liabilities.
Loans and advances Loans and advances include mortgage loans, other asset-based loans, including collateralised debt obligations, and other secured and unsecured loans.
In the absence of an observable market for these instruments, the fair value is determined by using internally developed models that are specific to the instrument and that incorporate all available observable inputs.
These models involve discounting the contractual cash flows by using a credit-adjusted zero-coupon rate.
Investments and securities Investments and securities include government and  securities, listed and unlisted debt securities, preference shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments see below, short-term funds and securities treated as investments and certain other securities.
Pooled investments represent the Groups holdings of shares units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual funds and similar investment vehicles.
Pooled investments are stated at fair value.
The fair values of pooled investments are based on widely published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held in the underlying pooled investment funds.
Amounts owed to bank depositors The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors correspond with the carrying amount shown in the statement of financial position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.
Borrowed funds The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where applicable, or by reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.
Other financial assets and liabilities The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities which comprise cash and cash equivalents, cash with central banks, other assets and liabilities are reasonably approximated by the carrying amounts reflected in the statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.
168 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials ii Fair value hierarchy Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy.
Level 1 quoted market prices: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Instruments classified as Level 1 generally comprise listed equity securities, government securities and other listed debt securities and similar instruments, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds and investment contract liabilities linked to Level 1 pooled investments and other assets.
Level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial assets and liabilities valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
Instruments classified as Level 2 generally comprise unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is based on models involving no significant unobservable data.
Certain inputs, such as discount rates and credit spreads may be unobservable but these inputs do not have a significant impact on the fair value of the instrument.
This includes certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and amounts owed to bank depositors.
Level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs: financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Instruments classified as Level 3 generally comprise unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable inputs, securities where the market is not considered sufficiently active, including certain inactive pooled investments, and derivatives embedded in certain portfolios of insurance contracts where the derivative is not closely related to the host contract and the valuation contains significant unobservable inputs.
The Group deems a transfer to have occurred between Level 1 and Level 2 when an active, traded primary market ceases to exist for that financial instrument.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market.
In the event that the market for a financial asset or liability is not active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, another valuation technique is used.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads.
In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to measure the fair value of the asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process.
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable data and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.
However, certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant inputs that are unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental.
A financial asset or liability in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or liabilitys carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs.
In this context, unobservable means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the price at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value.
Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair value derived from a valuation technique with significant unobservable data may be attributable to observable inputs.
Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will generally be restricted to uncertainty about the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.
Details of the Groups valuation techniques can be found in note E1 q iii.
There have been no significant changes to the valuation techniques applied.

This relates to Old Mutual Wealth investments in illiquid property investment funds.
Observable inputs which can be utilised to value these funds are not readily available.
These investment funds back policyholder liabilities investment contracts for which there is a corresponding 464 million Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The backing of liabilities by assets means that the Group is not exposed to any profit or loss arising on the realisation of these investment funds.

When parameters are not amenable to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.
When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown reflect the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.
In respect of private equity investments, which are included as investment securities, the valuations are assessed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology appropriate to the specific investment, in line with industry guidelines.
In many of the methodologies, the principal assumption is the valuation multiple to be applied to the main financial indicators including, for example, multiples for comparable listed companies and discounts for marketability.
For asset-backed securities whose prices are unobservable, models are used to generate the expected value of the asset, incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and the historical performance of the underlying assets.
The models used are calibrated by using securities for which external market information is available.
For structured notes and other derivatives, principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset values.
These principle assumptions include credit volatilities and correlations used in the valuation of the structured credit derivatives.
For such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, and examination of historical levels.
The table below summarises the significant inputs to value instruments categorised as Level 3 and their sensitivity to changes in the inputs used.

Such instruments would include the value of bonds and debt instruments.
Financial instruments that are classified as Level 3 use more market unobservable inputs such as an entitys earnings and adjusted price earning volatilities.
The valuation of the majority of Level 3 instruments uses extensive inputs, which are unobservable in order to determine their value.
Alternative assumptions Accounting standards require consideration of the effect of reasonable possible alternative assumptions on the fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities.
Alternative assumptions are assessed in terms of possible favourable and unfavourable changes in the key market inputs for the major types of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, ranging from, for example, up to a 13% change in the price earnings multiple for equity securities, and up to a 13% change in the discount rates applied to debt securities and volatility assumptions in derivative contracts.
Changes in business risk inputs such as lapses and non-performance risk were also considered.
The impact of reasonable possible alternative assumptions on other comprehensive income was nil in both years.
iv Financial instruments designated as fair value through profit or loss Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position that would otherwise be categorised as loans and receivables under IAS 39 have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2014 At 31 December 2013 Maximum Current Maximum Current exposure to financial exposure to financial Change in fair value due to change in credit risk credit risk year Cumulative credit risk year Cumulative Loans and advances 3,347 3,434 1 Investments and securities 6,406 1 3 6,547 7 2 Other financial assets 21 19 8 9,774 1 3 10,000 16 2 Certain items in the Groups statement of financial position that would otherwise be categorised as financial liabilities at amortised cost under IAS 39 have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Information relating to the change in fair value of these items as it relates to credit risk is shown in the table below: m At 31 December 2014 At 31 December 2013 Current Contractual Current Contractual Change in fair value due to financial maturity financial maturity change in credit risk Fair value year Cumulative amount Fair value year Cumulative amount Borrowed funds 734 10 97 606 747 32 87 709 Amounts owed to bank depositors 2,199 2 5 2,198 5,179 1 4 5,177 2,933 8 92 2,804 5,926 31 83 5,886 The fair values of other categories of financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss do not change significantly in respect of credit risk.
The change in fair value due to a change in credit risk shown above is determined as the amount of the change in fair value of the instrument that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
For loans and receivables that have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss, individual credit spreads are determined at inception as the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the interest rate charged to the client.
Subsequent changes in the benchmark interest rate and the credit spread give rise to changes in fair value of the financial instrument.
Loans and advances are reviewed for observable changes in credit risk and the credit spread is adjusted at subsequent dates if there has been an observable change in credit risk relating to a particular loan or advance.
No credit derivatives are used to hedge the credit risk on any of the financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The change in fair value due to credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss has been determined as the difference between fair values determined using a liability curve adjusted for credit and a risk-free liability curve.
This difference is cross-checked to market-related data on credit spreads, where available.

The calculation of the fair value of these financial instruments incorporates the Groups best estimate of the value at which these financial assets could be exchanged, or financial liabilities transferred, between market participants at the measurement date.
The Groups estimate of what fair value is does not necessarily represent what it would be able to sell the asset for or transfer the respective financial liability for in an involuntary liquidation or distressed sale.
Held-to-maturity investments and securities The fair value of investments and other securities is determined based on available market prices and directors valuations where appropriate.
They would be classified into Level 1 available market prices and Level 2 directors valuations of the fair value hierarchy.
Loans and advances Loans and advances, detailed in note E3, that are not recognised at fair value, principally comprise variable-rate financial assets.
The interest rates on these variable rate-financial assets are adjusted when the applicable benchmark interest rate changes.
Loans and advances are not actively traded in most markets and it is therefore not possible to determine the fair value of these loans and advances using observable market prices and market inputs.
Due to the unique characteristics of the loans and advances portfolio and the fact that there have been no recent transactions involving the disposals of such loans and advances, there is no basis to determine a price that could be negotiated between market participants in an orderly transaction.
The Group is not currently in the position of a forced sale of such underlying loans and advances and it would therefore be inappropriate to value the loans and advances on a forced-sale basis.
The Group has developed a methodology and model to determine the fair value of the gross exposures for the performing loans and advances measured at amortised cost.
This model incorporates the use of average interest rates and projected monthly cash flows per product type.
Future cash flows are discounted using interest rates at which similar loans would be granted to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities.
Inputs into the model include various assumptions utilised in the pricing of loans and advances.
The determination of such inputs is highly subjective and therefore any change to one or more of the assumptions may result in a significant change in the determination of the fair value of loans and advances.
The Group is of the opinion that the carrying value of loans and advances approximates fair value.
Loans and advances would be classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other financial assets The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, mandatory deposits with central banks, provisions and accrurals and trade and other receivables and other assets are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short term in nature or are repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.
Cash and cash equivalents and mandatory reserves would be classified into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Trade, other receivables and other assets would be classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Amounts owed to depositors The Group is of the opinion that the carrying value of variable-rate amounts owed to depositors approximates fair value.
Amounts owed to depositors would be classified into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Borrowed funds The Group is of the opinion that the carrying value of variable-rate long-term debt instruments approximates fair value.
Long-term debt instruments would generally be classified into Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other financial liabilities The carrying values of trade, other payables and other liabilities are considered a reasonable approximation of their respective fair values, as they are either short-term in nature or are repriced to current market rates at frequent intervals.
Trade, other payables and other liabilities would be classified into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
ii Non-financial instruments The fair value of plant and equipment, investment in associated undertakings and joint ventures that are not categorised as Designated at fair value through profit or loss and Life assurance policyholder liabilities that are not categorised as Designated at fair value through profit or loss approximates the respective carrying values.
All of these assets and liabilities would be classified as Level 3.
176 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials s Non-recurring assets and liabilities at fair value i Business combinations Non-recurring assets and liabilities recognised at fair value arise from assets and liabilities that have been acquired as a result of business combinations refer to note H8.
The assets and liabilities acquired are valued based on expected future cash flows which will be received from the assets or paid to settle the liability and which have been discounted at an appropriate rate.
The majority of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are classified as Level 3.
The following table shows the fair value of the non-recurring assets and liabilities as a result of business acquisitions: m As at 31 December 2014 Intangible assets 100 Property, plant and equipment 20 Loans and advances 498 Trade, other receivables and other assets 15 Total assets 633 Borrowed funds 335 Amounts owed to bank depositors 69 Trade, other payables and other liabilities 129 Total liabilities 533 The comparative amounts for 2013 were 55 million for assets and 26 million for liabilities.
ii Held for sale buildings and investment properties Investment properties of 156 million 2013: nil and buildings of nil 2013: 5 million were transferred to held for sale during the year and are regarded as non-recurring assets and classified as Level 3.
More detail on held to sale assets can be found in note I2.
t Risks Market risk i Overview Market risk is the risk of a financial impact arising from the changes in values of financial assets or financial liabilities from changes in equity, bond and property prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market risk arises differently across the Groups businesses depending on the types of financial assets and liabilities held.
The Group has developed risk policies which set out the practices which are used to monitor and manage market risk.
These policies are cascaded to business units across the Group.
Each of the Groups business units has their own established set of policies, principles and governance processes to monitor and manage market risk within their individual businesses and in accordance with their local regulatory requirements.
Group-level governance and monitoring processes provide oversight of these individual approaches to the management of market risk.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings, capital position and embedded value to market risk is monitored through the Groups embedded value and risk appetite reporting processes.
ii Insurance operations For the Groups insurance operations, equity, property, volatility and interest rate risk exposure to capital and to earnings are quantified in accordance with the Groups risk appetite framework.
Additional detail is provided in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
In South Africa the stock selection and investment analysis process is supported by a well developed research function.
For fixed annuities, market risks are managed where possible by investing in fixed interest securities with a duration closely corresponding to those liabilities.
Market risk on policies that include guarantees where shareholders carry the investment risk, principally reside in the South African guaranteed non-profit annuity book, which is closely matched with gilts and semi-gilts.
Other non-profit policies are also suitably matched based upon comprehensive investment guidelines.
Market risk on with-profit policies with guarantees is managed through appropriate asset-liability matching, which includes hedging, as per the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
In Old Mutual Wealths unit-linked assurance operations, policyholders carry the full market risk, with the only risk to the Group being asset-based fee risk from charges on policyholder funds.
In respect of Old Mutual Wealths shareholders funds, market risk is addressed in Old Mutual Wealths investment policy, which provides for very limited opportunity for entities to invest their shareholder capital in equities and other volatile assets.
For the variable annuity business in Old Mutual Bermuda, market risk to shareholders arises from offering policyholder guaranteed returns.
In addition, these guarantees are US dollar denominated and a significant portion of the underlying assets invested in by Old Mutual Bermudas clients are exposed to currencies other than US dollar.
The market and currency risk is managed through a dynamic tail hedging strategy, with the overall exposures to changes in markets monitored closely so that timely actions can be taken to re-establish hedging as required.
Old Mutual plc 177 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued iii Banking operations The principal market risks arising in the Groups banking operations arise from: Trading risk in Nedbank Capital and Banking book interest rate risk from repricing and or maturity mismatches between onand off-balance sheet components in all banking businesses.
A comprehensive market risk framework is used to ensure that market risks are understood and managed.
Governance structures are in place to achieve effective independent monitoring and management of market risk.
Trading risk Market risk exposures from trading activities at Nedbank Capital are measured using Value-at-Risk VaR, supplemented by sensitivity analysis, and stress and scenario analysis.

The VaR risk measure for Nedbank estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregated to arrive at a single risk number.
The one-day 99% VaR number used by Nedbank represents the overnight loss that has less than 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
By its nature, VaR is only a single measure and cannot be relied upon on its own as a means of measuring and managing risk.

Nedbank uses standard analytical techniques to measure interest rate sensitivity within its banking book.
This includes static re-price gap analysis and a point-in-time interest income stress testing for parallel interest rate moves over a forward-looking 12 month period.
At 31 December 2014 the sensitivity of the banking book to a 1% instantaneous reduction in interest rates would have led to a reduction in net interest income and equity of 57 million 2013: 54 million.

This means that in the event of increasing interest rates, net interest income will remain stable in the short-term.
Old Mutual plc 179 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E1: Group statement of financial position continued u Currency translation risk The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates from changes in the sterling value of surplus assets and earnings denominated in foreign currencies.
From a capital perspective, our capital is held where our risks are located and currency translation risk would only be realised if we were to require a transfer of surplus capital between regions during a period of stress.
The functional currencies of the Groups principal overseas operations are South African rand, US dollar and Euro.
The Group reduces this risk through the use of currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Such risk mitigation techniques are reflected in the currency analysis that follows.
The derivative instruments are stated at their fair value, and not their notional amounts.
Therefore, this table does not reflect the results of risk management activities undertaken by the Group.
180 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials v Master netting or similar agreements The Group offsets financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position when it has a legal enforceable right to do so and intends to settle on a net basis simultaneously.
Certain master netting agreements do not provide the Group with the current legally enforceable right to offset the instruments.
The majority of these transactions are governed by the principles of ISDA or similar types of agreements.
These agreements aim to protect the parties in the event of default.
The following tables present information on the potential effect of netting offset arrangements after taking into consideration these types of agreements.

The capital objectives are to maintain the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while supporting the optimisation of return relative to the risks.
The Group ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and strategic initiatives.
The Groups overall capital risk appetite is set with reference to the requirements of the relevant stakeholders and seeks to: Maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support stakeholder requirements Optimise debt to equity structure to enhance shareholder returns Retain financial flexibility by maintaining liquidity including unutilised committed credit lines.
The primary sources of capital used by the Group are equity shareholders funds, preference shares, subordinated debt and borrowings.
Alternative resources are utilised where appropriate.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, credit ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
The individual companies in the Group are subject to regulatory capital requirements at an individual level.
In addition the Group as a whole is subject to the solvency requirements of the Financial Groups Directive FGD as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
Further detail of the Groups regulatory capital surplus and that of subsidiaries is provided in the Annual Report and Accounts.
As at 31 December 2014, the unaudited pro-forma surplus was estimated to be 2.0 billion 2013: 2.1 billion.
The FGD position will be submitted to the PRA by 30 April 2015.
A key component of our approach to capital management is to ensure that the Groups policies are aligned with the Groups overall strategy, business plans and risk appetite.
The Groups Capital Management Committee GCMC reviews the capital structure regularly.
E2: Credit risk Overall exposure to credit risk The Group is exposed to banking credit risk from lending and other financing activities, through its exposure to Nedbank and its exposure to banking operations within Emerging Markets.
Nedbanks lending portfolio forms a substantial part of the Groups loans and advances, as analysed in note E3.
Credit risk represents the most significant risk type facing Nedbank, accounting for 58% of its economic capital requirements.
Nedbanks credit risk profile is managed in terms of its credit risk management framework, which encompasses comprehensive credit risk policy, mandate limits and governance structures, and is approved by the Nedbank Board.
The Group has adopted a policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the financial loss from defaults.
Credit risk is managed through research and analysis at the time of investment.
The Groups exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are continuously monitored.
The overlap of exposures to a single counterparty is limited across regions.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to counterparty credit rating and collateral requirements set by the Credit Risk Policy.
The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit defaults and movements in credit spreads from its insurance businesses.
This includes counterparty default risk, which arises mainly from reinsurance and hedging arrangements.
Other than the above, the Group has other limited credit risk exposures in respect of amounts due from policyholders, intermediaries and reinsurers.
Credit risk exposure from our property & casualty business is small and none of the life assurance operations cedes significant risk through reinsurance.
Loans to policyholders are secured on the surrender value of the relevant policies.

Collateral held includes cash and debt securities.
Cash collateral is included as part of cash equivalents.
These transactions are entered into under terms and conditions that are standard industry practice to securities borrowing and lending activities.
ii Non-financial collateral The Group takes other non-monetary collateral to recover outstanding lending exposures in the event of the borrower being unable or unwilling to fulfil its obligations.
This includes mortgage over property both residential and commercial, and liens over business assets including, but not limited to plant, vehicles, aircraft, inventories and trade debtors and guarantees from parties other than the borrower.
Where the Group is exposed to syndicated lending, the collateral offered by the borrower is secured by security special purpose vehicles.
Should a counterparty be unable to settle its obligations, the Group takes possession of collateral as full or part settlement of such amounts.
In general, the Group seeks to dispose of such property and other assets that are not readily convertible into cash as soon as the market for the relevant asset permits.
A further analysis of credit risk is provided in notes E3, E4, E5 and F4.

Loans and advances increased by 5.1%, in local currency terms, due to solid growth in wholesale banking.
This was offset by muted growth in retail home loans and reductions in personal loans.
Nedbanks credit loss ratio at 0.79% compared with 2013 1.06% improved, due to impairments decreasing by 19.0%.
Further detail on Nedbank is available at www.

At 31 December 2014, the Group has provided 283 million 2013: 203 million in debt securities collateral under repurchase arrangements.
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group has not provided any cash collateral for security lending arrangements.
E6: Derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities The Group utilises derivative instruments for both economic hedging and non-hedging purposes.
The derivative instruments become in-themoney or out-of-the-money as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or asset prices relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are in-the-money or out-of-the-money and, therefore, the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The Group undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with which it deals and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Group.
The following table provides a detailed breakdown of the Groups derivative financial instruments outstanding at year-end.
These instruments allow the Group and its customers to transfer, modify or reduce their credit, equity market, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

E8: Insurance and investment contracts Life assurance Classification of contracts Contracts sold as life assurance with the exception of unit-linked assurance contracts are categorised into insurance contracts, contracts with a discretionary participation feature or investment contracts, being in accordance with the classification criteria set out in the following paragraphs.
For the Groups unit-linked assurance business, contracts are separated into an insurance component and an investment component known as unbundling and each unbundled component is accounted for separately in accordance with the accounting policy for that component.
Unit-linked assurance contracts are savings contracts with a small or insignificant component of insurance risk.
Contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the Group from the policyholder is not significant are classified as investment contracts.
Such contracts include savings and or investment contracts sold without life assurance protection.
Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholder are classified as insurance contracts.
Insurance risk is the risk other than financial risk.
Contracts accounted for as insurance contracts include life assurance contracts and savings contracts providing more than an insignificant amount of life assurance protection.
Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, security price, security index, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided, in the case of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.
Contracts with discretionary participating features are those under which the policyholder holds a contractual right to receive additional payments as a supplement to guaranteed minimum payments.
These additional payments, the amount or timing of which is at the Groups discretion, represent a significant portion of the total contractual payments and are contractually based on 1 the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract, 2 realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or 3 the profit or loss of the Group.
Investment contracts with discretionary participating features, which have no life assurance protection in the policy terms, are accounted for in the same manner as insurance contracts.
188 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Premiums on life assurance Premiums and annuity considerations receivable under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are stated gross of commission and exclude taxes and levies.
Premiums in respect of unit-linked insurance contracts are recognised when the liability is established.
Premiums in respect of other insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are recognised when due for payment.
Outward reinsurance premiums are recognised when due for payment.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deposits and credited directly to investment contract liabilities.
Revenue on investment management service contracts Fees charged for investment management services provided in conjunction with an investment contract are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees, which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which services will be provided.
Fees charged for investment management service contracts by asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
Claims paid on life assurance Claims paid under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature include maturities, annuities, surrenders, death and disability payments.
Maturity and annuity claims are recorded as they fall due for payment.
Death and disability claims and surrenders are accounted for when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Amounts paid under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deductions from investment contract liabilities.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are not recorded through profit or loss, except for fee income and investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to investment contract liabilities.
Insurance contract provisions Insurance contract provisions for African businesses have been computed using a gross premium valuation method.
Provisions in respect of African businesses have been made in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis as set out in the guidelines issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa in Standard of Actuarial Practice SAP 104 2012.
Under this guideline, provisions are valued using realistic expectations of future experience, with margins for prudence and deferral of profit emergence.
Provisions for investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are also computed using the gross premium valuation method in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis.
Surplus allocated to policyholders but not yet distributed related to these contracts is included as part of life assurance policyholder liabilities.
Reserves on immediate annuities and guaranteed payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.
For other territories, the valuation bases adopted are in accordance with local actuarial practices and methodologies.
Derivatives embedded in an insurance contract are not separated and measured at fair value if the embedded derivative itself qualifies for recognition as an insurance contract.
In this case the entire contract is measured as described above.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and intangible assets is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount to the carrying value of the liability at discount rates appropriate to the business in question.
Where a shortfall is identified, an additional provision is made.
The provision estimation techniques and assumptions are periodically reviewed, with any changes in estimates reflected in profit or loss as they occur.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross insurance contract provisions and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
In respect of South African life assurance, shadow accounting is applied to insurance contract provisions where the underlying measurement of the policyholder liability depends directly on the value of owner-occupied property and the unrealised gains and losses on such property, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The shadow accounting adjustment to insurance contract provisions is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealised gains or losses on owner-occupied property backing insurance contract provisions are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as insurance contracts.
Liability adequacy testing is performed to ensure that the carrying amount of the liability for financial guarantee contracts is sufficient.
Old Mutual plc 189 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E8: Insurance and investment contracts continued Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups other than unit-linked business are recorded at amortised cost unless they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency, for example where the corresponding assets are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups unit-linked business are recorded at fair value.
For such liabilities, including the deposit component of unbundled unit-linked assurance contracts, fair value is calculated as the account balance, which is the value of the units allocated to the policyholder, based on the bid price of the assets in the underlying fund adjusted for tax.
Investment contract liabilities measured at fair value are subject to a deposit floor such that the liability established cannot be less than the amount repayable on demand.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs for insurance contracts comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the sale of insurance contracts.
As the gross premium valuation method used in African territories to determine insurance contract provisions makes implicit allowance for the deferral of acquisition costs, no explicit deferred acquisition cost asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for the contracts issued in these areas.
Deferral of costs on insurance business in other territories is limited to the extent that they are deemed recoverable from available future margins.
Costs incurred in acquiring investment management service contracts Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are recognised as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are amortised as the related revenue is recognised.
Costs attributable to investment management service contracts in the asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
Property & casualty Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party and are not classified as life insurance are classified as general insurance.
All classes of property & casualty business are accounted for on an annual basis.
Premiums in property & casualty Premiums stated gross of commissions exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for in the period in which the risk commences.
The proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of risk after the reporting date is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods as unearned premiums, so that earned premiums relate to risks carried during the accounting period.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related direct insurance.
Claims on property & casualty Claims incurred comprise the settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising during the year and adjustments to prior year claim provisions.
Outstanding claims comprise claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether reported or not.
Outstanding claims do not include any provision for possible future claims where the claims arise under contracts not in existence at the reporting date.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its claim liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserve is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events, and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made, and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used and estimates made are reviewed regularly.
Acquisition costs on property & casualty Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the diversification of its risks.
Assets, liabilities and income and expense arising from ceded reinsurance contracts are presented separately from the related assets, liabilities, income and expense from the related insurance contracts because the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its policyholders.
Only rights under contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk are accounted for as reinsurance assets.
Rights under contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as financial instruments.
190 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials Reinsurance premiums for ceded reinsurance are recognised as an expense on a basis that is consistent with the recognition basis for the premiums on the related insurance contracts.
For property & casualty business, reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks.
The unexpensed portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is included in reinsurance assets.
The amounts recognised as reinsurance assets are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions held in respect of the related insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets include recoveries due from reinsurance companies in respect of claims paid.
Reinsurance assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date.
An asset is deemed impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after its initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all amounts due, and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.
The reinsurers share of policyholder liabilities in Old Mutual Wealth relates to investment contracts where the direct management of assets are ceded to a third party through a reinsurance arrangement.
Due to the nature of the arrangement, there is no transfer of insurance risk.

The undiscounted cash flows of discretionary participating investment contracts only include amount vested or to be vested, while their carrying amount include reserves that are payable at the discretion of the Group.
The Group acknowledges that for property & casualty the unearned premium provision, which will be recognised as earned premium in the future, will most likely not lead to claim cash outflows equal to this provision.
The Group has estimated the potential claim outflows that may be associated with this unearned premium.

Contracts issued by the Group may include both insurance and financial risk.
Contracts with significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts, while contracts with no or insignificant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.
The Group assumes insurance risk by issuing insurance contracts, under which the Group agrees to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event affecting the policyholder occurs.
Insurance risk includes mortality and morbidity risk in the case of life assurance or risk of loss from fire, accident, or other source in the case of property & casualty.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to variable claims experience on life assurance, critical illness and other protection business and exposure to variable operating experience in respect of factors such as persistency levels and management expenses.
Unfavourable persistency, expenses and mortality and morbidity claim rates, relative to the actuarial assumptions made in the pricing process, may prevent the Group from achieving its profit objectives.
The Group has developed a risk policy which sets out the practices which are used to monitor and manage insurance risk as well as management information and stress testing requirements.
The policy is cascaded to all entities across the Group who each have their own risk policy suite aligned to the Group.
As well as management of persistency, expense and claims experience, the risk policy sets requirements and standards on matters such as underwriting and claims management practices, and the use of reinsurance to mitigate insurance risk.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings, capital position and embedded value to insurance risk is monitored through the Groups embedded value and risk appetite reporting processes.
The insurance risk profile and experience is closely monitored to ensure that the exposure remains acceptable.
The financial impact of insurance risk events is examined through stress tests carried out within the MCEV and IFRS sensitivities, ICA and Economic Capital assessment.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity risk is the risk that death, critical illness and disability claims are different from expected levels.
Possible causes are new and unexpected epidemics and widespread changes in lifestyle such as eating, smoking and exercise habits.
Higher than expected claims levels will reduce expected emerging profits.
For contracts where the insured risk is survival, the most significant factor that is likely to adversely impact the claims experience is continued improvement in medical science and social conditions that increase longevity.
For unit-linked contracts, a risk charge is applied to meet the expected cost of the insured benefit in excess of the unit value.
This risk charge can be altered in the event of significant changes in the expectation for future claims experience, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
The operations manage mortality and morbidity risks through its underwriting policy and external reinsurance arrangements where its policy is to retain certain types of insurance risks within specified maximum single event loss limits.
Exposures above accepted limits are transferred to reinsurance counterparties.
Persistency Persistency risk is the risk that policyholder surrenders, transfers or premium cessation on contracts occur at levels that are different to expected.
In order to limit this risk to an acceptable level, products including charging and commission structures are designed to limit the risk of direct financial loss on surrender, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Persistency statistics are monitored monthly and a detailed persistency analysis at a product level is carried out on an annual basis.
Management actions may be triggered if statistics show significant adverse movement or emerging trends in experience.
Expenses Expense risk is the risk that actual expenses and expense inflation differ from expected levels.
Higher expenses and expense inflation may result in emerging profit falling below the Groups profit objectives.
Expense levels are monitored quarterly against budgets and forecasts.
An activity-based costing process is used to allocate costs relating to processes and activities to individual product lines.
Some products structures include maintenance charges.
These charges are reviewed annually in light of changes in maintenance expense levels.
This review may result in changes in charge levels, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Tax Tax risk is the risk that the projected taxation basis for basic life assurance business is incorrect, resulting in contracts being incorrectly priced.
Tax risk also represents potential changes in the interpretation or application of prevailing tax legislation as paid by either policyholders or shareholders, resulting in higher taxes reducing profitability or increasing shareholder tax burdens.
The taxation position of the operations is projected annually and tax changes will result in changes to new business pricing models as part of the annual control cycle.
High risk issues and emerging trends are reported internally on a quarterly basis.
194 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials g Sensitivity analysis life assurance Changes in key assumptions used to value insurance contracts would result in increases or decreases to the insurance contract provisions recorded, with impact on profit loss and or shareholders equity.
The effect of a change in assumption is mitigated by the offset partial or full to the bonus stabilisation reserve in the case of smoothed bonus products in South Africa.
The tables below demonstrate the effect of a change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged: % m m m Emerging Old Mutual At 31 December 2014 Change Markets Wealth Bermuda Assumption Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 271 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 44 Discontinuance rates 10 7 1 1 Expenses maintenance 10 54 3 % m m m Emerging Old Mutual At 31 December 2013 Change Markets Wealth Bermuda Assumption Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 256 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 42 Discontinuance rates 10 7 1 3 Expenses maintenance 10 52 3 Emerging Markets The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The insurance contract liabilities recorded for the Emerging Market business are also impacted by the valuation discount rate assumed.
Lowering this rate by 1% with a corresponding reduction in the valuation inflation rate assumption would result in a net increase to the insurance contract liabilities, and decrease to profit, of 3 million 2013: 6 million.
This impact is calculated with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The 2014 impact is lower than the 2013 impact due to further management actions taken to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on operating profit.
It should be noted that where the assets and liabilities of a product are closely matched for instance non-profit annuity business or where the impact of a lower valuation discount rate is hedged or partially hedged, the net effect has been shown since the asset movement fully or partially offsets the liability movement.
Old Mutual Wealth The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated independently using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in premiums paid by policyholders.
The assumption changes have no impact on the linked UK business.
Whole of Life is the main product group affected by the lapse assumption change.
This is because the policies have the longest duration and represent close to 95% of the reserve.
The main product groups impacted by the expense, mortality and morbidity sensitivities are Whole of Life and Accelerated Critical Illness.
In the Old Mutual Wealth business, non-linked liabilities are well matched by gilts so that the net impact of a valuation interest rate change taking asset and liability movement into account is negligible.
Old Mutual Bermuda Lapses and partial withdrawals have the largest impact where increased activity reduces the guarantee portion of the business since less death and living benefit exposure is expected in the future.
Mortality plays a much smaller part in Bermuda since all the business is accumulation savings type business.
Increased deaths do accelerate payment of guaranteed minimum death benefits but there is a comparable release of reserve on the maturity guarantee providing an offset about 74% of the variable annuity business has both death living benefits.
Old Mutual plc 195 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued E8: Insurance and investment contracts continued h Sensitivity analysis property & casualty An increase of 10% in the average cost of claims would require the recognition of an additional loss of 37 million 2013: 49 million net of reinsurance.
Similarly, an increase of 10% in the ultimate number of claims would result in an additional loss of 37 million 2013: 49 million net of reinsurance.
The majority of the Groups property & casualty contracts are classified as short-tailed, meaning that any claim is settled within a year after the loss date.
This contrasts with the long-tailed classes where the claims cost take longer to materialise and settle.
The Groups property & casualty long-tailed business is generally limited to accident, third-party motor, liability and some engineering classes.
In total the long-tail business comprises less than five per cent of an average years claim costs.
i Reinsurance assets credit risk None of the Groups reinsurance assets are either past due or impaired.
Of the reinsurance assets shown in the statement of financial position all are considered investment grade with the exception of 36 million of unrated exposures 2013: 73 million.
Collateral is not taken against reinsurance assets or deposits held with reinsurers other than in limited circumstances.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Individual businesses separately maintain and manage their local liquidity requirements according to their business needs, within the overall liquidity framework established by Old Mutual plc.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity capital requirements, and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups available cash resources and, if necessary, available credit facilities.
The Groups liquid resources are held in large portfolios of highly marketable securities, for example listed bonds, actively traded pooled investments, equities and cash and cash equivalents.
Whilst most of the Groups policyholder and banking liabilities are generally repayable on demand, the Groups expectation is that policyholders and banking depositors will only require funds on an ongoing basis.
However, cash resources and other liquid assets are maintained in the event of a need for additional liquidity.
Information on the nature of the investments and securities held is given in note E4.
The Group renewed the existing revolving credit facility of 800 million 2013: 800 million in August 2014, maturing in August 2019 2013: April 2016.
Details, together with information on the Groups borrowed funds, are given in note E9.
The key information reviewed by the Groups Executive Directors and Executive Committee, together with the Groups Capital Management Committee, is a detailed management report on the Groups and holding companys current and planned capital and liquidity position, together with summary information on the current and planned liquidity positions of the Groups operating segments.
Forecasts are updated regularly based on new information received and also as part of the Groups annual business planning cycle.
The Group and holding companys liquidity and capital position and forecast are presented to the Old Mutual plc Board of Directors on a regular basis.
Additionally the Group conducts regular stress testing around liquidity requirements, as referenced in the Principal risks and uncertainties section refer to page 32.
Group operating segments are required, both in terms of their local requirements and in accordance with direction from the holding company, to establish their own processes for managing their liquidity and capital needs and these are subject to review by their local oversight functions, with representation from the Group.
Further information on liquidity and the holding company cash flows is contained in the financial performance section of the Business Review section.
The Group does not have material liquidity exposure to special purpose entities or investment funds.
The contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities are set out in notes E6, E8, E9 and E10.
200 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials F: Other statement of financial position notes F1: Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the business over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest if any, this excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Non-controlling interest is measured at fair value of the stake held on initial recognition of the business combination.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least once annually.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On loss of control of a subsidiary undertaking, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
On disposal of a business, where goodwill on acquisition is allocated to the entire cash-generating unit CGU, goodwill is allocated to the disposal on a relative basis.
Goodwill is allocated to one or more CGUs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The directors annually test for impairment of each CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, at a level that is no larger than that of the Groups identified operating segments for the purposes of segment reporting.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU or group of CGUs exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
b Present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business The present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business is capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset.
The capitalised value is the present value of cash flows anticipated in the future from the relevant book of insurance and investment contract policies acquired at the date of the acquisition.
This is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the associated life assurance fund and book of in-force policies in order to estimate future after tax profits attributable to shareholders.
The valuation is based on actuarial principles taking into account future premium income, mortality, disease and surrender probabilities, together with future costs and investment returns on the assets supporting the fund.
These profits are discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
The key assumptions impacting the valuation are discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The asset is amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The recoverable amount of the asset is re-calculated at each reporting date and any impairment losses recognised accordingly.
c Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Contractual banking and asset management customer relationships, relationships with distribution channels and similar intangible assets, acquired as a part of a business combination, are capitalised at their fair value, represented by the estimated net present value of the future cash flows from the relevant relationships acquired at the date of acquisition.
Brands and similar items acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value based on a relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Subsequent to initial recognition such acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below: Distribution channels 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Brand 15 20 years The estimated useful life is re-evaluated on a regular basis.
d Internally developed software Internally developed software software is amortised over its estimated useful life, where applicable.
Such assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software is recognised in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed whereas costs incurred in the development phase are capitalised subject to meeting specific criteria, set out in the relevant accounting guidance.
The main criteria being that future economic benefits can be identified as a result of the development expenditure.
Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant software, which range between two and 10 years.

202 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials g Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units The carrying amount of goodwill accords with the operating segmentation shown in note B and primarily relates to the cash generating units CGUs of Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank and Institutional Asset Management.
m At At 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 Emerging Markets 194 101 Old Mutual Wealth 823 864 Nedbank 277 285 Institutional Asset Management 838 793 Goodwill, net of impairment losses 2,132 2,043 h Annual impairment testing of goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested annually for impairment for each CGU, by comparing the carrying amount of each CGU to its recoverable amount, being the higher of that CGUs value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell.
An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs generate revenues through their life assurance and asset management businesses.
The value-in-use calculations for the life assurance operations are determined using the reported embedded value methodology plus a discounted cash flow calculation for the value of new business.
The value of new business represents the present value of future profits from expected new business.
Embedded value represents the shareholders interest in the life assurance business and is calculated in accordance with MCEV principles.
The cash flows attributable to the value of new business are determined with reference to latest approved three-year business plans.
Projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflation based growth assumption.
The value-in-use calculations for the asset management operations are similarly determined based on discounted cash flow models derived from the latest approved three-year business plans.
An additional two years of projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using inflation based growth rates.
The cash flows are discounted at economic profit rates applicable to each individual CGU.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for the Emerging Markets, and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs are as follows: The growth rate the rate used is an inflation based growth assumption, which varies by CGU and is based on external market factors particular to that CGU.
Emerging Markets applied the growth rate of between 9.0% to 12.0% 2013: 8.7% to 9.7% to both its life assurance business and asset management business, being the expected growth rate reflected in the business plans of each CGU.
Old Mutual Wealth applied a weighted average calculation to determine the growth rate of 14.0% 2013: 14.5% The discount rate the applied rate used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
Rates applied were 13.5% 2013: 13.3% for Emerging Markets and 9.0% 2013: 9.6% for Old Mutual Wealth.
Old Mutual Wealth is regarded by the directors as a single cash generating unit due to the integrated nature of its operations.
On disposals of businesses, goodwill is allocated to them based on the relative size of the net assets of the business.
The directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of the Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs to fall below their carrying amounts.
Nedbank The impairment test in respect of the Nedbank CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its estimated value-in-use.
The value-in-use has been determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are the discount rate and growth rate, which are based on the three year business plan plus the terminal value.
A growth rate between 0.0%, international business and 5.8%, South African business 2013: 0.0% and 5.0% was applied to extrapolate cash flows for an additional two years beyond the three-year business plan period.
A terminal value, using the same growth rate, is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The discount rate applied was approximately 12.8% 2013: 12.0%.
The directors are satisfied that a reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amount.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for Institutional Asset Management are as follows: The three year business plan plus two further years have growth rate assumptions based on managements expectation of performance over this period.
A terminal value, using a long-term growth rate of 4.0% 2013: 4.0% is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The assumed long-term growth rate was determined with reference to nominal historical gross domestic product GDP growth, and the outlook for nominal GDP growth for the US The risk-adjusted discount rate applied was 12.0% 2013: 12.0%.

The value of property, plant and equipment pledged as security is 6 million 2013: 2 million.
The revaluation of land and buildings relates to Emerging Markets and Nedbank.
In 2014, Emerging Markets made revaluation gains of 6 million on land 2013: 1 million and 6 million 2013: 10 million on buildings.
Nedbank made revaluation gains of 6 million on land 2013: nil and 10 million on buildings 2013: 23 million.
For Emerging Markets, land and buildings are valued as at 31 December each year by internal professional valuers and external valuations are obtained once every three years.
For Nedbank, valuations are performed every three years by external professional valuers.
For each business, the valuation methodology adopted is dependent upon the nature of the property.
Income generating assets are valued using discounted cash flows and vacant land and property are valued according to sales of comparable properties.
The carrying value that would have been recognised had the land and buildings been carried under the historic cost model would be 28 million 2013: 25 million and 171 million 2013: 179 million respectively for Emerging Markets, 15 million 2013: 16 million and 113 million 2013: 112 million for Nedbank respectively.

210 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials F10: Non-controlling interests a Profit or loss i Ordinary shares The non-controlling interests share of profit for the financial year has been calculated on the basis of the Groups effective ownership of the subsidiaries in which it does not own 100% of the ordinary equity.
The principal subsidiaries where a non-controlling interest exists is Nedbank, the Groups banking business in South Africa and OM Asset Management plc, the Groups asset management business.
For the year ended 31 December 2014 the non-controlling interests attributable to ordinary shares was 252 million 2013: 259 million.

These reflect the legal ownership of this business following the implementation for Black Economic Empowerment BEE schemes in 2005.
In accordance with IFRS accounting rules the shares issued for BEE purposes are deemed to be, in substance, options.
Therefore the effective ownership interest of the minorities reflected in arriving at profit after tax in the consolidated income statement is lower than that applied in arriving at adjusted operating profit after tax.
In 2014 the increase in adjusted operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests as a result of this was 24 million 2013: 20 million.

As at 31 December 2014, the Group held 46 million 2013: 48 million in unconsolidated investment funds which are included in investment and securities.
b Consolidation considerations for structured entities In structured entities voting rights are not the predominant factor in deciding who controls the entity but rather the Groups exposure to the variability of returns from these entities.
The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds.
Determining whether the Group controls such an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of decision making rights as fund manager, the investors rights to remove the fund manager and the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the fund in the form of interest held and exposure to variable returns.
In most instances the Groups decision-making authority, in its capacity as fund manager, with regard to these funds is regarded to be welldefined.
Discretion is exercised when decisions regarding the relevant activities of these funds are being made.
For funds managed by the Group where the investors have the right to remove the Group as fund manager without cause, the fees earned by the Group, are considered to be market related.
These agreements include only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services and level of skills negotiated on an arms length basis.
The Group has concluded that it acts as agent on behalf of the investors in all instances.
The Group is considered to be acting as principal where the Group is the fund manager and is able to make the investment decisions on behalf of the unit holders, earn a variable fee and there are no kick out rights that would remove the Group as fund manager.
This is considered to be a critical accounting judgment and is discussed in A3 d. There have been no changes in facts or circumstances which have changed the Groups conclusion on the consolidation of funds.
The Group has not provided any non-contractual support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has committed to providing certain liquidity facilities for certain securitisation vehicles.
c Securitisation vehicles consolidated in the Groups statement of financial position Nedbank Securitisations The Group through Nedbank uses securitisation primarily as a funding diversification tool and to add flexibility in mitigating structural liquidity risk.
Nedbank currently has four active securitisation transactions: Synthesis Funding Limited Synthesis, an asset-backed commercial paper ABCP programme launched in 2004 GreenHouse Funding RF Ltd, Series 2 GreenHouse, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme GreenHouse Funding III RF Ltd Series 3 GreenHouse 3, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme and Precinct Funding 1 RF Ltd Precinct, a commercial mortgage-backed securitisation programme.
These vehicles are the full extent of the Groups current securitisation exposure.

Old Mutual plc 217 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 H: Other notes H1: Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

b Measurements and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The grant date for the UK and South African plan awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.
The fair value of awards expected to be granted in 2015 which will have an IFRS 2 grant date of 1 January 2014, is shown separately below.
The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
220 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials c Share-based payment arrangements relating to Institutional Asset Management During the year ended 31 December 2014, OM Asset Management plc had the following share-based payment arrangements: Initial public offering IPO Incentive Plan During 2011, a share-based compensation plan was implemented for certain key employees of OM Asset Management plc in connection with the stated intention of exploring a potential IPO of the business.
The plan was designed to reward participants for achievement of strategic objectives and metrics and value creation over the period of exploring an IPO.
The awards consisted of a mix of cash, payable and paid in the first quarter of 2014, and restricted shares in Old Mutual plc, which were granted during the second quarter of 2014, and vest ratably over three years from that date.
At grant date, the stock awards under this plan had an aggregate value of $4 million.
The total expense recognised during 2014 in relation to this plan was $1 million 2013: $4 million and 2012: $2 million.
OM Asset Management plc Equity Incentive Plan In connection with the IPO, certain employees who held unvested Old Mutual plc restricted shares were given the opportunity to exchange their Old Mutual plc restricted shares for restricted shares of OM Asset Management plc, with vesting conditions similar to those to which they were currently subject to.
These restricted shares were awarded to employees as part of a one-time arrangement.
This exchange program was intended to provide employees who elected to participate with restricted share awards of OM Asset Management plc ordinary shares of equivalent value to the Old Mutual plc restricted shares they currently held.
The exchange valued OM Asset Management plc ordinary shares at the price sold to investors in the IPO.
The exchange valued Old Mutual plcs ordinary shares using the weighted-average sale price over the three consecutive trading days on the London Stock Exchange up to and including the date of the exchange.
The exchange occurred following the effectiveness of the OM Asset Management plc registration statement on 8 October 2014.
OM Group UK Limited transferred 1,212,766 OM Asset Management plc ordinary shares equivalent to 5,914,981 Old Mutual plc restricted shares to employees as part of this exchange programme.
In connection with the conversion of these restricted shares, an equity incentive plan was implemented at OM Asset Management plc.
The plan is intended to encourage ownership of stock by employees and to provide additional incentive for them to promote the success of OM Asset Management plcs business through the grant of awards of or pertaining to shares of OM Asset Management plcs stock.
The grant date fair value per share, calculated based on the closing share price as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange on the measurement date, is used to determine the fair value of restricted shares granted to employees.
There is a mechanism at OM Asset Management plc to ensure sufficient shares are available under the plan for grants issued.
Restricted shares under the plan generally have a vesting period of three years.
OM Asset Management plc Affiliate Equity Plans Equity granted during the year to employees of firms participating in the OM Asset Management plc Affiliate Equity Plans vests three to four years from the date of grant, conditional upon continued employment over this period.
Equity purchased by employees vested immediately.
Grant date fair value and fair value used for reassessment was determined based on a multiple of prior year earnings.
Under the terms of the arrangements, participating employees may sell their equity back to OM Asset Management plc which acts as a buyer of last resort at a fixed multiple of prior year earnings, subject to certain restrictions.
Accordingly, the schemes are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments, despite the fact the initial purchase and or grants of equity are settled in equity instruments.
The following summarises the fair value of instruments purchased from and granted by OM Asset Management plc during the year: Total nonAffiliate Affiliate Affiliate controlling share share shares interest in Instruments granted and purchased during the year purchases grants forfeited affiliate Percentage of affiliate equity 2014 0.10% 2.69% 10.75% 7.96% 2013 0.03% 1.87% 0.50% 1.40% Fair value of instruments $m 2014 $17m 2013 $11m Represents fair value in excess of consideration received for affiliate share purchases OM Asset Management plc annual bonus awards The OM Asset Management plc Affiliate Equity Plans are incorporated into annual bonus awards of employees at participating firms, which are to be settled partly in cash and partly in equity.
The level of bonus is contingent upon current year financial and individual performance, therefore the vesting period for bonus equity to be granted during 2015 in respect of the 2014 financial year has been determined to commence from 1 January 2014.
It is anticipated that instruments with a fair value of $10 million 2013: $15 million and 2012: $11 million will be granted during 2015 to firms participating in the OM Asset Management plc Affiliate Equity Plans based on 2014 financial performance.
Old Mutual plc 221 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 H: Other notes continued H2: Share-based payments continued Acadian Asset Management AAM Class B equity interests in AAM acquired by employees during 2007 entitled the participating employees to 28.57% of the earnings of AAM in excess of $120 million, and to a liquidation preference proportionate to their shareholding.
In consideration for the equity acquired, the participating employees agreed to forego a portion of existing long-term incentive payments owed.
The difference between the carrying amount of this consideration and the fair value of the interest acquired was treated as share-based compensation expense in 2007.
Fair value was determined based on the discounted projected future cash flows of AAM.
Effective 1 April 2011, certain terms of the plan were modified to provide for greater participation by Class B interest holders in Acadians profits and cash distributions.
In addition, provisions were added to provide greater liquidity and transferability for the holders of Class B interests.
The plan has since included a feature whereby participating employees may sell their equity back to OM Asset Management plc based on a multiple of prior 12 month earnings above a Class A equity holders minimum preference amount, subject to certain restrictions.
The surrender-date fair value of the Class B interests prior to these modifications amounted to $7 million, and this amount was reclassified from non-controlling interests to cash-settled share-based payments liabilities as a result of the liquidity features added.
The excess of the fair value of the modified award over its pre-modification fair value was $21 million, and was accounted for as incremental cash-settled share-based payments compensation expense and liability.
As the implementation of the modifications were subject to a two year vesting period, the incremental cash-settled share-based payments compensation expense and subsequent revaluations of the liability each period to its fair value, along with the reclassification of the $7 million pre-modification fair value of the award from non-controlling interests as a liability, were recognised rateably over that period commencing 1 April 2011.
The remaining $35 million of the initial fair value of the equity-settled plan that was surrendered by Class B interest holders was transferred to controlling interest equity at the conclusion of the vesting period.
During 2014, employees sold Class B equity interests of 14.29% back to OM Asset Management plc.
Class B equity interests of 14.29% remain outstanding at 31 December 2014. d Forfeitable Restricted share grants The following summarises the fair value of restricted shares granted by the Group during the year: Weighted average Instruments granted and purchased during the year Number granted fair value Shares in Old Mutual plc London Stock Exchange 2014 11,047,898 2.02 2013 9,933,597 1.95 Shares in Old Mutual plc Johannesburg Stock Exchange 2014 13,350,717 R35.35 2013 16,585,998 R27.71 Shares in Nedbank Ltd 2014 4,225,723 R201.11 2013 4,206,027 R185.09 The share price at measurement date was used to determine the fair value of the restricted shares.
Expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value where the holder of the restricted share is entitled to dividends throughout the vesting period.
e Annual bonus awards The UK and South Africa Plan Awards give rise to annual bonus awards.
The level of annual bonus awards is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The accounting grant date for the South African and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
The Group anticipates awards under the South African scheme of 10,022,998 restricted shares 2013: 9,331,684.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R34.70 2013: R32.79.

H4: Contingent liabilities m At At 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 Guarantees and assets pledged as collateral security 1,325 2,052 Irrevocable letters of credit 181 184 Secured lending 455 304 Other contingent liabilities 6 30 The Group, through its South African banking business, has pledged debt securities amounting to 767 million 2013: 703 million as collateral for deposits received under re-purchase agreements.
These amounts represent assets that have been transferred but do not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39.
Contingent liabilities tax The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group.
The Group is committed to conducting its tax affairs in accordance with the tax legislation of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
All interpretations made by management are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction and the relevant legislation.
There are occasions where the Groups interpretation of tax law may be challenged by the Revenue authorities.
The financial statements include provisions that reflect the Groups assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to materialise as part of their review.
The Board is satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to cater for the resolution of tax uncertainties and that the resources required to fund such potential settlements are sufficient.
Due to the level of estimation required in determining tax provisions amounts eventually payable may differ from the provision recognised.
224 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials For the year ended 31 December 2014 South Africa During the course of 2014 discussions have been ongoing with the South African Revenue Services SARS in relation to the tax treatment of investments supporting Fixed Bond products sold by OMLAC SA between 2004 and 2013.
SARS has submitted an assessment for amounts due.
OMLAC SA has appealed the assessments and discussions regarding the merits of the OMLAC SA treatment of these items are continuing with SARS.
Nedbank litigation There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Ltd and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at present.
As previously disclosed, the largest of these potential actions are claims in the High Court against Nedbank by certain shareholders in Pinnacle Point Group Ltd, alleging that Nedbank had a legal duty of care to them arising from a share swap transaction.
In 2013 two of these claims of R147 million and of R802 million were dismissed by the North Gauteng High Court.
The only claim remaining is for R355 million.
Originally these shareholders and others lodged proceedings with the Securities Regulation Panel SRP for an order declaring that an affected transaction took place.
The SRP ruled that no affected transaction took place.
The last remaining claimant brought an application to the South Gauteng High Court for the review of the SRP ruling.
This application was dismissed with costs on 15 November 2013.
The applicant filed a notice to apply for leave to appeal this judgment, and on 16 July 2014 the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled in Nedbanks favour by refusing the application.
During 2011 further actions were instituted against Nedbank by other stakeholders for R210 million and by Absa Bank Limited for R773 million.
In both these actions Nedbank have filed exceptions against the claims.
On 25 August 2014, the R210 million claim was withdrawn.
Nedbank and its legal advisers remain of the opinion that the remaining claims are ambitious, and that the remaining claimants will have great difficulty succeeding.
Consumer protection Old Mutual is committed to treating customers fairly and supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and treating customers fairly is central to how our businesses operate.
We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet this commitment, but there is the risk of regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for customer redress which can result in retrospective changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines.
The Group monitors the exposure to these actions and makes provision for the related costs as appropriate.
H5: Commitments Capital commitments The Groups capital commitments are detailed in the table below.
The Groups management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.
