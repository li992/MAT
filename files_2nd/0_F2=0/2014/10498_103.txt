A change to UK tax legislation largely exempts, from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2014 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
