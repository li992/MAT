Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure of the Company to foreign currency movements for its non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10 percent against GBP sterling, the Companys: loss for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014 would have decreased by $389,000.
profit for the 52 week period ended 27 December 2013 would have increased by $73,000.
In both periods, this is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to foreign exchange movements on sterling-denominated monetary assets and liabilities: there is no impact on other equity reserves 2013: $nil.
A 10 percent weakening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change in currency rates given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.
