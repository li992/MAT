Note 1 On 1 July 2013 Penguin Random House was formed, upon the completion of an agreement between Pearson and Bertelsmann to merge their respective trade publishing companies, Penguin and Random House, with the parent companies owning 47% and 53% of the combined business respectively.
The shareholder agreement includes protection rights for Pearson as the minority shareholder including rights to dividends.
Management considers ownership percentage, board composition and the additional protective rights, and exercises judgement to determine that Pearson has significant influence over Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann has the power to direct the relevant activities and therefore control.
Note 2 The Group has a 50% interest in The Economist Newspaper Ltd, publisher of one of the worlds leading weekly business and current affairs magazines.
The Economist has a unique structure of A, B and Trustee shares, which was established to ensure its independence from proprietorial control.
Pearson, as holder of the B shares, has never controlled the Economist by virtue of its shareholding or influence, and management assesses that it has significant influence over the company.

A valuation of the Penguin Random House ventures was determined during the negotiation of the transaction between Bertlesmann and Pearson.
This valuation of the business was calculated using the income approach, discounting future cash flows to the present value.
Cash flow projections were prepared for both businesses by country taking into account the front and backlist trends and extrapolated using long term growth rate assumptions.
The cash flows were discounted using discount rates with risk premiums specific to each geographic region.
A discount to the Groups share of the total value to reflect the Groups non-controlling minority ownership was applied.
The Group finalised its acquisition accounting for Penguin Random House in 2014 and an adjustment to the opening position with respect to deferred tax and goodwill was made.
The overall carrying value of the associate in 2013 was unchanged however the additions and goodwill balances in the table above have been restated to reflect the final accounting.
