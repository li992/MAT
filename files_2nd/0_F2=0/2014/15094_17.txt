Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
1 Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements of SuperGroup Plc the Company and SuperGroup Plc and its subsidiary undertakings in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Turkey as detailed in note 20 the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by fair values, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The current period 2014 is for the 51 weeks and 6 days ended 26 April 2014 2013: 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 2013.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies note 2.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except where indicated.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail Limited, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited into the financial statements of SuperGroup Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve.
All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting note 1c.
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in associate is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of investment in the statement of comprehensive income.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
c Business combinations The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 95 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
1 Principal accounting policies continued On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
d Foreign currencies The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the actual rate or average rate if not materially different.
Differences on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.
e Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities, as described below.
The Group bases its estimate of returns on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Standalone store revenue Standalone store revenue from the provision of sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Standalone store sales are settled in cash or by credit or payment card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the customer with a right to exchange within 28 days.
Concession revenue Concession revenues from the provision of sale of goods are recognised gross at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Concession revenues are settled in cash, by the concession grantors net of commissions or other fees payable.
It is the concessions policy to sell its products with a right to exchange within 28 days and a cash refund within 14 days.
Provisions are made for concession returns based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Internet revenue Revenue from the provision of the sale of goods on the internet is recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which is the point of delivery.
Transactions are settled by credit card, payment card or PayPal.
Provisions are made for internet credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Wholesale revenue Wholesale revenues from the sale of goods are recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which depends on the specific terms and conditions of sales transactions and which are typically upon either dispatch or delivery.
Revenues are settled in cash, net of discounts.
Provisions are made for Wholesale credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.

1 Principal accounting policies continued f Other income Other income primarily relates to proceeds from legal claims and royalty income.
Royalty income is recognised gross on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Wholesale royalty agreements.
g Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested.
Finance income is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
h Finance expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Finance expenses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
i Leasing and similar commitments Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent-free periods and are considered financing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, as they are the same as financing from landlords to fund store fit-outs.
Cash contributions Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a deferred income liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement of comprehensive income over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the longer of the term of the lease, or from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
Lease premiums Lease premiums paid to landlords are initially recognised as a prepayment, and lease premiums paid to previous tenants are initially recognised as an intangible asset, in the balance sheet, at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and debited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition but excludes interest.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their remaining useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years on a straight-line basis Leasehold improvements 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Computer equipment 3 5 years on a straight-line basis Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
The depreciation policy has been amended following the opening of the new distribution facility in 2014 and the relevant assets are depreciated over a useful economic life of ten years.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 97 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
1 Principal accounting policies continued k Impairment The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting note 1b is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings.
l Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Trademarks 10 years Website and software 5 years Lease premiums Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis Distribution agreements 6 years Trademark costs comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs.
Website and software costs consist primarily of externally incurred development costs.
Lease premiums comprise the amount paid to the previous tenant to acquire the lease.
Distribution agreements comprise the fair value, at date of acquisition, of distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
m Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investors share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition.
The groups investment in associate includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
n Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at their fair value and re-measured at fair value at each period end.
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held for trading.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting.
Foreign forward exchange derivative gains and losses are recognised in other gains and losses net.
o Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost comprises costs associated with the purchase and bringing of inventories to the distribution centres and is based on the weighted average principle.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-downs and shrinkage.
p Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.

1 Principal accounting policies continued q Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are offset against cash when a right of offset exists and the Group intends to use this right of offset.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, less overdrafts, which are repayable on demand.
r Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs, including facility fees incurred, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans.
Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss, and the amortisation is recorded as finance income cost using the effective interest yield method on the asset liability.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
s Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are discounted if the impact on the provision is deemed to be material.
t Employee benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its employees.
The Group pays contributions into an independently administered fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The costs to the Group of providing these benefits are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income and comprise the amount of contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the year.
Payroll expense and related contributions Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
u Share based payments The Group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan.
The fair value of the shares under such plans is recognised as an expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
v Trade and other payables Trade and other payables, excluding lease incentives see note 1i, are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value which approximates book value.
Trade and other payables are derecognised when the contractual obligations to the cash flows from the liability expire or are transferred.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 99 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
1 Principal accounting policies continued w Taxation The policy for current and deferred income tax, when relevant, is as follows: tax on the profit or loss for the period will comprise current and deferred income tax: current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years: deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: the amount of deferred income tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date: a deferred income tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised: and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
x Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date.
Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or proposed or declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved for issue by the directors.
y Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity, as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
z Retained earnings The retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits and losses of the Group.
aa Merger reserve, non-controlling interests and other reserves The merger reserve arose on the Group restructuring in March 2010 and represents the differences on consolidation arising on the adoption of predecessor accounting.
This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of net assets acquired in the transaction less any impairment.
Non-controlling interests relate to business arrangements in which SuperGroup has less than a 100% share.
Other reserves arose on the business combination occurring in Germany regarding former KuH stores.
ab Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating DecisionMaker.
The Chief Operating Decision-Maker, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the executive board.
ac Cost of sales Cost of sales comprises movements between opening and closing inventories, purchases, carriage in, commissions payable, and other related expenses.

1 Principal accounting policies continued ad Exceptional items Items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature, are disclosed separately as exceptional items in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The separate reporting of exceptional items, which are presented as exceptional within the relevant category in the Group statement of comprehensive income, helps to provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
The principal items which may be included as exceptional items are: significant profit loss on the disposal of non-current assets: impairment of property, plant and equipment: impairment of intangible assets: impact on deferred income tax for changes in tax rates: and the costs and benefits associated with significant corporate, financial or operational restructuring, including acquisitions.
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a Recoverability of deferred income tax assets The Group has recognised a significant deferred income tax asset in its financial statements which requires judgement for determining the extent of its recoverability at each balance sheet date.
The Group assesses recoverability with reference to board approved forecasts of future taxable profits.
These forecasts require the use of assumptions and estimates.
The Groups subsidiaries will need to make taxable profits of at least 127.5m over the next 16 years 2013: 141.9m over 17 years to obtain the full tax deduction against the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets in those subsidiaries.
Discussions with HMRC in respect of the tax deductible intangibles arising on the March 2010 reorganisation are ongoing.
Written confirmation has been received from HMRC that they will not challenge the commercial nature of the transactions.
The amounts of intangible assets available for tax relief are yet to be agreed with HMRC.
Following independent advice the directors consider that the related deferred tax asset in respect of these intangible assets continues to be considered recoverable.
b Impairment of goodwill The Group has tested goodwill for impairment which requires judgement when determining the recoverable amount.
Further details of the impairment testing and the key assumptions are included in more detail in note 19. c Provisions The Group has recognised provisions for impairment of inventories, impairment of trade receivables, post year end credit notes and returns in respect of revenue, employee bonuses, dilapidations, onerous leases and income tax in its financial statements which requires management to make judgements.
The judgements, estimates and associated assumptions necessary to calculate these provisions are based on historical experience and other reasonable factors.
d Acquisition accounting In accounting for business combinations, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired have to be measured at their fair values.
In particular, some judgement is required in estimating the fair value of inventory with reference to current selling prices and costs to sell, and judgement in estimating the valuation of intangible assets with reference to forecast future sales under the pre-existing contract.
Details concerning acquisitions and business combinations are outlined in notes 20, 33 and 34.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 101 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued e Exceptional items Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional.
Details of these items cataegorised as exceptional are outlined in note 13.
3 New accounting pronouncements The following new or recent standards, interpretations and amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group where appropriate or applicable to the Group for the financial year begining 29 April 2013: Amendment to IAS 1, Financial statement presentation, regarding other comprehensive income.
The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for the Group to group items presented in other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently.
Amendments to IAS 36, Impairment of assets, on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets.
This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
IFRS 11, Joint arrangements, focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form.
There are two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures.
Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of an arrangement.
A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
Joint ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement: joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 29 April 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010.
It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument.
For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements.
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board.

4 Segment information The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on the reports reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker executive board members: the CODM.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profit before income tax, before inter-segment royalties.
The CODM considers the business from a customer perspective only, being Retail and Wholesale.
The CODM reviews the balance sheet at a Group level.
No separate balance sheet measures are provided between the Retail and Wholesale segments.
The CODM receives information, reviews the performance of the business, allocates resources and approves budgets for two operating segments, and therefore information is disclosed in respect of the following two segments: Retail principal activities comprise the operation of UK, Republic of Ireland and European stores, concessions and all internet sites.
Revenue is derived from the sale to individual consumers of own brand and third party clothing, footwear and accessories.
Wholesale principal activities comprise the ownership of brands, wholesale distribution of own brand products clothing, footwear and accessories worldwide and trade sales.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The Group reports and manages central functions separately to the Retail and Wholesale operations, which includes design, finance, HR, IT, legal, marketing, merchandising, property, sourcing and the goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation.
The revenue from external parties reported to the board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the IFRS financial statements.
Inter-segment royalties, transfers or transactions entered into under a cost plus pricing structure are not reflected in the performance of each business segment.
Segmental information for the main reportable business segments of the Group for April 2014 and April 2013 is set out below: Retail Wholesale Central costs Group 2014 2014 2014 2014 m m m m Total segment revenue 295.4 165.3 460.7 Less: inter-segment revenue 9.9 19.9 29.8 Revenue from external customers 285.5 145.4 430.9 Finance income 0.6 0.6 Profit loss before income tax 49.2 41.0 45.0 45.2 23332.04 8 August 2014 7:26 AM Proof 1 SuperGroup.

13 Non-underlying and exceptional adjustments continued Re-measurements a Fair value re-measurement of deferred share consideration The SuperGroup Europe BVBA acquisition in February 2011 included two tranches of deferred contingent share consideration to be issued on the second and third anniversaries of the acquisition.
The consideration is payable in shares, and the shares will be issued in proportion to the percentage completion of certain sales and store number targets.
The fair value of these shares at the acquisition date was 10.3m.
IFRS 3 revised requires deferred contingent share consideration to be re-measured at each period end to reflect the estimated percentage completion of the targets and change in share price.
The share price movement from 7.36 at April 2013 to 16.10 in February 2014, the date the shares were issued on the third anniversary of the acquisition, increased the liability by 3.9m 2013: the share price movement from 3.50 at April 2012 to 6.93 in February 2013, the date the shares were issued on the second anniversary of the acquisition, increased the liability by 0.8m.

The remainder of 0.6m 2013: 0.1m is included within other movements such as accelerated capital allowances and temporary differences.
In preparation for the listing of the business on the London Stock Exchange, a substantial reorganisation was undertaken with effect from 7 March 2010 and the Groups subsidiaries acquired net assets with a total fair value of 375m.
Within this amount, 340m was identified as intangible assets and goodwill, of which the directors believe that 187m should be deductible against taxable profits over the useful economic lives of the respective assets.
This gave rise to 52.4m of the exceptional deferred income tax credit booked in 2010.
Based on this the directors consider that the Groups future cash tax expense should be reduced by approximately 2.8m per annum using the corporation tax rate of 20%.
The Groups income tax expense on underlying profit of 14.9m represents an effective tax rate of 24.0% for the period ended 26 April 2014.
The Groups underlying effective tax rate of 24.0% is higher than the statutory rate of 22.8%, primarily due to depreciation of non-qualifying assets and non-allowable expenses.
Discussions with HMRC in respect of the tax deductible goodwill arising on the March 2010 reorganisation are ongoing.
15 Loss attributable to SuperGroup Plc The after tax loss for the 51 weeks and 6 days ended 26 April 2014 for the Company was 2.8m 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013: loss of 0.6m.

Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the goodwill on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
Goodwill attributable to SuperGroup Europe BVBA amounted to 18.0m 2013: 18.3m.
The recoverable amounts in 2014 were measured based on value in use 2013: based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next three years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
Goodwill of 0.7m arose in the business combination in Germany during the year note 33, within the Retail segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell.
The consideration for the acquisition supports the valuation of goodwill, as does the proximity of the applicable impairment review date.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 119 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
19 Intangible assets continued Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Pre-tax adjusted discount rates Pre-tax adjusted discount rates are derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
A relative risk adjustment has been applied to the rate to reflect the risk inherent in the territories to which the cash flows arise.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used for SuperGroup Europe BVBA of 11.7%, reflects the mix of geographical territories within which the CGU operates.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the three years, a long-term average growth rate has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm retail growth rate in each of the territories where the CGU is based.
This results in an average growth rate for SuperGroup Europe BVBA of 2.6%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The table below shows the assumptions used and the assumptions required in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
The directors do not consider this to be reasonably possible.
Group Assumptions Assumption used required % % Pre tax risk adjusted discount rate 11.7 19.4 Long-term growth rate 2.6 -5.6 The discounted forecast operating cash flows were 111m and a percentage change of 51.0% in isolation would be required in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

The overdraft in the Company is part of an offset arrangement.
No interest has been incurred 31 Financial risk management The company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is responsible for managing.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
For those sales considered higher risk, the Group operates a policy of cash in advance of sale.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by PayPal.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.
Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 129 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements.
31 Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign currency exposure arises from: transactions sales purchases denominated in foreign currencies: monetary items mainly cash receivables and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies: and investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation.
The Group is mainly exposed to US dollar and euro currency risks.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each company is monitored and managed at Group level.
The Groups policy is to economic hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.
As at 26 April 2014 and 28 April 2013, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk.
Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been applied.
Forward exchange contracts are valued at fair value.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are not hedged.
At 26 April 2014 if the currency had weakened strengthened by 10% against both the US dollar and euro with all other variables held constant, profit for the period would have been 2.0m 2013: 1.8m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US dollar euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables.
The figure of 10% used for sensitivity analysis has been chosen because it represents a range of reasonably probable fluctuations in exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposure is as follows: Group 2014 2013 US Dollar Euro US Dollar Euro m m m m Financial assets Trade receivables 0.1 17.5 0.4 14.2 Cash and cash equivalents 1.4 12.5 5.7 6.3 Assets 1.5 30.0 6.1 20.5 Financial liabilities Trade payables 1.1 10.2 1.8 6.9 Liabilities 1.1 10.2 1.8 6.9 Net exposure 0.4 19.8 4.3 13.6 The US dollar and euro overdrafts form part of an offset arrangement and as such each currency is netted off against other cash balances in the same currency and is not recognised as an overdraft in its own right.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows variable rate.
Management does not currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the Group.
The Groups significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 24 and 25.

Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the derivative is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the derivative is less than 12 months.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and noncurrent borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The Group is in a net cash position at 26 April 2014.
The Directors have concluded that the company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth.
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2014 2013: nil.

33 Business combinations During the year a 70% subsidiary of SuperGroup Plc, Superdry Germany GmbH Superdry Germany completed a business combination with KUH Retail GmbH KuH, a former distributor and former agent in Germany for the Group.
The other 30% shareholder in Superdry Germany is Ranft Soller Holdings GmbH RSH.
RSH is the sole shareholder of KuH.
The business combination was completed on 31 October 2013 and involved KuH selling their trade and certain assets to Superdry Germany for the consideration as set out below.
The trade and assets acquired principally consists of seven Superdry branded stores.
As part of the transaction the pre-existing agency agreement between the Group and KuH was terminated in order that the Group would take back control of this territory.
The transaction will allow the Group to benefit from improved Wholesale margins, accelerate the roll-out of German stores by investing its own capital, and retain the local operational and management expertise.
Superdry Germany paid a total of 5.8m in consideration by a combination of cash and non-cash funding.
Cash paid by SuperGroup Plc on acquisition was 1.0m.
Deferred cash payable within one year was 2.1m.
Fair value of other considerations was 2.7m.
Of the 2.1m deferred cash payable, 0.9m remains unpaid as at 26 April 2014.
2.2m of cash outflow has been recognised in respect of acquisition of business being 1.0m on acquisition and 1.2m to April 2014 in the Group cash flow statement.
The provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: m Intangible assets 1.2 Property, plant and equipment 1.2 Inventories 2.8 Provision for deferred tax 0.1 Total fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 5.1 Goodwill on acquisition 0.7 Total consideration 5.8 Intangible assets relate to reacquired rights to the German territory.
Goodwill represents expected synergies and is expected to be tax deductible.
Included within non-underlying and exceptional items are Buy-out of German agent and business combination costs, which included 1.8m of cash termination fee, 0.1m of accrued termination fees plus legal and other costs.
The amounts included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 1 November 2013 included revenue of 7.2m and there was a net loss of 0.3m over the same period.
Had the transaction occurred on the first day of the financial year, then estimated contribution to Group revenues would have been 12.6m and net profits 0.5m.
In addition to the consideration of 5.8m, a deferred contingent consideration of 0.7m, payable in shares in SuperGroup Plc in the three years up to the third anniversary of the transaction, was agreed.
The shares are payable contingent upon the continued employment of a key individual over this time period.
In accordance with IFRS 3 revised this consideration is treated as a postacquisition employment expense and accordingly 0.1m has been recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has a call option that allows them to acquire the remaining 30% shareholding in Superdry Germany from RSH three years after the acquisition date.
The call option is a financial instrument and is accounted for at fair value through the statement of comprehensive income.
At the acquisition date and at 26 April 2014, the fair value of this call option is negligible.

Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the release of the annual report valuations of assets and liabilities acquired along with the disclosures required by IFRS 3 Revised have not been able to be prepared.
Disclosure will be made in future annual financial statements.
The book value of assets acquired was 1.4m and no material goodwill is expected to arise once the fair value exercise is complete.
