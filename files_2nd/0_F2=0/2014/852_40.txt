Performance measures We assess the financial performance of our businesses using a variety of measures.
Certain of these measures are particularly important and we have termed them key performance indicators.
We refer to these measures in the strategic report and use them in presentations to investors.
In this section, we explain the relevance to us of each of these measures and show how they are calculated.
Some of these measures are non-IFRS measures because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS.
We do not regard these non-IFRS measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and it should be noted that they may not be comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
Scope revenue Scope revenue represents reported revenue less flow-through procurement revenue.
Flow-through procurement revenue and costs are recognised when we purchase materials, equipment or third-party services for our customers on a reimbursable basis.
We do not recognise any profit on flow-through procurement costs.
Scope revenue is a non-IFRS measure that we present because it represents the revenue that we have earned from providing services to our customers.
We use scope revenue in the calculation of trading margin because our margins would otherwise be reduced by flow-through revenue on which we earn no profit and would fluctuate from one period to another depending on the extent of procurement activities.

Each of these measures is based on an IFRS measure of profit but excludes specific items whose inclusion in the IFRS measure hinders the comparison of the trading performance of our businesses from one period to another, with each other or with those of our competitors.
Management has identified the following specific items that are excluded in arriving at these non-IFRS measures: exceptional items: the amortisation of intangible assets: and asbestos-related costs net of insurance recoveries.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense that are material by their size, incidence or nature and may include, but are not restricted to: acquisitionrelated costs: restructuring costs: gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets: and gains and losses on the disposal or closure of businesses.
Acquisition-related costs may include transaction costs including external advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees and attributable internal costs, the amortisation of acquisition-related facility fees, payments to selling shareholders that are accounted for as remuneration and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.
Exceptional items that were recognised in continuing operations are analysed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trading profit, trading margin and adjusted profit before tax exclude items that can have a significant effect on the Groups profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the equivalent IFRS measures.
Management compensates for these limitations by separately monitoring the items that are excluded from the equivalent IFRS measures in calculating these non-IFRS measures.
Trading profit Trading profit represents profit before net financing expense excluding exceptional items: the amortisation of intangible assets: and asbestos-related costs net of insurance recoveries.
Trading profit includes the Groups share of the trading profit of joint ventures.
Trading profit is the measure used by management to assess the trading performance of the Groups individual businesses and is the measure of segment profit that we present under IFRS.
Trading profit is a non-IFRS measure when presented on a consolidated basis.

Trading margin is a non-IFRS measure that is used by management to measure the success of our businesses in managing their cost base and improving profitability.

Adjusted profit before tax is a non-IFRS measure that is used by management to assess the trend in the Groups overall profitability.

Trading cash flow is a non-IFRS measure which is an indicator of the Groups ability to generate cash from its continuing operations before taking into account exceptional items and the servicing of long-term obligations and the settlement of legacy issues.

We define the underlying change as the year-on-year change excluding the effect of flow-through procurement, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and currency exchange rate movements.

Growth in adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is an indicator of the underlying trend in the Groups ability to generate earnings and may be useful to investors in assessing the value of the Companys ordinary shares for example, by way of price earnings multiples.
Whilst IFRS does not define any adjusted EPS measures, the presentation of such measures is permitted in financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Accordingly, reconciliations of adjusted diluted EPS to diluted EPS from continuing operations for each period presented are included in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

Whilst dividend cover is an indicator of the sustainability of future dividend payments in the context of the Groups underlying trading performance, we can only pay dividends to the extent of the Companys accumulated distributable reserves.
