The apportionment of our shareholder assets is predominantly weighted towards debt securities and loans.
In comparison, policyholder and participating funds contain a greater proportion of equities and other investments e. g. unit trusts, reflecting the underlying investment mandates.
We carry investments on our statement of financial position at either fair value or amortised cost.
At 31 December 2014, approximately 98% of the Groups total investments were carried at fair value on the statement of financial position.
Financial investment balances included in the remainder of these disclosures include financial investments of operations classified as held for sale.
For more information about financial investments analysed according to their accounting classification and valuation approach, as well as the cost, unrealised gains and losses, impairments, fair value and other information concerning financial investments, see IFRS Financial statements Note 27 Financial investments.
Debt securities Participating fund asset and shareholder debt securities analysed by credit rating and sector Participating fund asset and shareholder debt securities analysed by credit rating and product type as at 31 December 2014 are set out in the table below.
Government and corporate debt securities are further analysed by type of issuer.
The credit rating used for each individual security is the median rating of the available ratings from the major credit rating agencies.
If a credit rating is available from only one of these rating agencies then this rating is used.
If an individual security has not been given a credit rating by any of the major rating agencies, the security is classified as non-rated.
For the table above we have expressed our rating using a rating scale whereby investment grade debt securities are classified within the range of AAA extremely strong to BBB good ratings, with AAA being the highest possible rating.
Debt securities which fall outside this range are classified as less than BBB.
This rating scale is analogous with that used by major rating agencies.
At 31 December 2014, the proportion of our shareholder debt securities that are investment grade increased to 91.3% 2013: 90.2%.
The remaining 8.7% of shareholder debt securities that do not have an external rating of BBB or higher can be split as follows: 0.8% are debt securities that are rated as below investment grade: and 7.9% are not rated by the major rating agencies.
Of the securities not rated by an external agency most are allocated an internal rating using a methodology largely consistent with that adopted by an external rating agency, and are considered to be of investment grade credit quality: these include 2.5 billion 2013: 2.4 billion of debt securities held in our UK Life business, predominantly made up of private placements and other corporate bonds, which have been internally rated as investment grade.
Total wrapped credit In respect of the wrapped credit investments, the table below shows the credit rating of the securities as they are officially rated, and an estimate of their rating without the guarantee.
As rating agencies do not provide credit ratings for individual wrapped credit securities without consideration of the insurance guarantee, the credit ratings disclosed in the table below are based on internal best estimates.
