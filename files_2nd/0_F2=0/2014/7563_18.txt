The presentation in the balance sheet is as follows: 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Deferred tax assets 40.3 23.2 Deferred tax liabilities 2.6 3.6 37.6 19.6 At the balance sheet date the Group had unused trading tax losses with a potential value of 10.1m 2013: 10.5m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
The Group also has carried forward capital losses and the related potential deferred tax asset of 17.2m 2013: 17.0m which has not been recognised.
Both of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 18 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS 87 Trade and other receivables 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 102.9 96.3 Prepayments and accrued income 28.7 24.6 Other receivables 1.5 1.5 133.1 122.4 Trade and other receivables are not interest-bearing, and are on commercial terms.
Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Balance at start of period 6.8 8.1 Increase decrease in allowance recognised in the income statement 0.5 1.3 Balance at end of period 7.3 6.8 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 28.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of period end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable or require provision.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specific amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 7.3m 2013: 6.8m consists of a specific provision of 2.9m 2013: 3.3m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 3.7m 2013: 4.1m, and a provision of 4.4m 2013: 3.5m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
4.6m of debts were written off in the period 2013: 5.0m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 16.5m before bad debt provision 2013: 13.0m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 88 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m 130 days past due 8.9 6.1 3160 days past due 1.7 1.4 6190 days past due 1.0 1.0 90 days past due 4.9 4.5 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 16.5 13.0 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit, and is available on demand.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in short-term UK Gilts.
They have maturity dates ranging between 1 and 3 months from the balance sheet date.
They return a fixed rate of interest.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the Gilts held at the balance sheet date is 0.3% pa.
These investments are classified as held-to-maturity, and are held at amortised cost.
There were no such investments at the prior period end.
The directors estimate that the fair value of these investments at the current period end is equal to their carrying value.
Assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure its bank facility.

Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 46 days 2013: 44 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 20 BORROWINGS 89 Total borrowings 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Current assets Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.6 0.1 Current borrowings Current portion of finance lease obligations 0.1 Non-current assets Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.3 0.9 Non-current borrowings Non-current portion of finance lease obligations 0.1 0.1 Total net borrowings 0.8 0.8 Bank borrowings The bank borrowings are repayable as follows: 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Disclosed under current assets On demand or within one year 0.4 Less: prepaid issue fees set against borrowings 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.1 Disclosed under non-current assets Prepaid issue fees 0.3 0.9 Total bank borrowings, net of prepaid fees 0.9 1.0 The Groups accounting policy is to capitalise prepaid loan facility issue fees and to set them against the related borrowings.
The fees are then amortised over the life of the facility.
The Groups current facility expires in July 2016.
At the current and prior period ends, the amount of fees relating to the period in excess of one year from the balance sheet date were greater than the corresponding amounts drawn down under the facility, thereby creating a net debit balance as shown above.
At the current period and prior ends, the amount of fees relating to the period less than one year from the balance sheet date was also greater than the corresponding amount drawn down.
All bank borrowings shown above are in sterling, and are drawn under the 140m 2013: 160m committed bank facility.
The terms of this facility are explained further in the final paragraph of note 28 a.
This facility is secured on the property and other assets of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets is as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 140m.
In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement this limit reduced from 160m to 140m in May 2014.
As at 27 December 2014, the Group had available 112m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 28 December 2013: 123m, in addition to the Groups cash and short-term investments as shown on the Balance Sheet.
If the Group were to use the facility, it would carry interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin would vary between 200 and 250 basis points and would be determined by the Groups rolling Adjusted Profit Before Tax.

Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 21 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 91 a Overview of all retirement benefit arrangements Defined contribution: auto-enrolment plan The Group operates an auto-enrolment defined contribution plan for employees, in line with recent UK Government legislation.
Under the terms of this scheme, employees make pension contributions out of their salaries, and the Group also makes additional contributions.
The Group decided to give employees the option to enter this plan earlier than the mandatory start date, and so the auto-enrolment plan was open to employees from November 2012 on a voluntary, opt-in, basis, although it was not mandatory to enrol employees into this plan until July 2013.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 2.7m 2013: 1.4m represents the Groups contributions due and payable in respect of the period.
Due to the timing of payments, 0.3m 2013: 0.2m of this amount was unpaid at the period end, but was paid shortly afterwards.
Defined contribution: other plan The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.
The assets of this plan are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This plan began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 0.8m 2013: 0.8m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan Characteristics and risks of the plan The Group operates a funded pension plan which provides benefits based on the career average pensionable pay of participating employees.
This plan was closed to new entrants from April 2013.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group, being held in a trustee-administered pension plan and invested with independent fund managers.
The trustee directors of the plan comprise three member-elected trustees, two independent trustees, and three Group-appointed trustees.
All trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan beneficiaries.
The plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, and market investment risk.
Accounting and actuarial valuation Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2011 by the plan actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2011 valuation to 27 December 2014, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
Funding and estimated contributions The Group has an agreement with the pension plan trustees to make additional deficit contributions to the plan over and above the normal level of contributions as follows: 25m per year until 31 March 2015, and 35m per year from 1 April 2015 until 30 June 2017.
This annual contribution may be increased by a one-off 10m per year, if profits are above pre-agreed levels until 31 March 2015.
An additional payment was triggered by the Groups 2014 profit being in excess of the pre-agreed level, and accordingly an additional one-off payment of 10m will be paid in 2015.
More details of the one-off payment and the funding arrangements are given in our Interim Management Statement of 5 November 2014 and in our RNS news announcement of 12 June 2012.
The funding agreement is subject to review as part of the 2014 triennial valuations and will be agreed with the Scheme trustees during 2015.
The trustees and the Group agree the contributions to be paid into the Plan.
The Groups estimated contributions to the defined benefit plan in the 52 weeks ending 26 December 2015 are 57m.
This figure has been arrived at by assuming that our funding arrangement with the trustees and our payment to the Pension Protection Fund remain at the same level as in 2014.
It also includes a one-off additional payment to the plan of 10m, which is mentioned above and which will be paid in 2015.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Differences between the defined benefit pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis and on a funding basis 92 As is mandatory under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group values its pension deficit in these accounts on an IAS 19 basis.
As shown below, the IAS 19 deficit at the current period end is 142.6m.
On a funding basis also know as a Technical Provisions basis, being the basis on which the triennial actuarial valuations are carried out, the funding deficit at the current period end is estimated at 249m, this estimate being based on an approximate roll-forward of the 2011 triennial funding valuation, updated for market conditions.
French post-employment benefits As explained in more detail in note 22, we have recognised a provision for a post-employment benefit which is payable to employees in our French subsidiaries under French law on retirement.
It is a lump sum payable on retirement, not a recurring pension.
As such, there is no underlying pension plan.
b Adoption of revisions to IAS 19 in the current period The revised IAS 19 was adopted in the current period.
As required, prior periods have been restated as if the revised standard had been in force in those periods.
Further detail of the nature of the revisions is given at note 2.

Separate scaling factors apply to males and females and to the different categories of members.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The mortality assumption adopted by the Group in 2013 and 2014 is equivalent to the following life expectancies: 94 2014 2013 Male years Female years Male years Female years Non-pensioner age 45 89.5 91.8 89.3 91.7 Pensioner age 65 88.6 89.6 88.5 89.5 Sensitivities If there was an increase decrease in the discount rate of 0.25%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 5%, or 54m, and a decrease increase in the total service cost of around 4.4% or 0.8m.
An increase of 0.25% to the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by around 35m, or 3.2%, and would increase total service cost by around 0.5m or 2.8%.
A decrease of 0.25% to the inflation rate would decrease scheme liabilities by around 31m, or 2.8%, and would decrease total service cost by around 0.4m or 2.2%.
The effect of an increase in inflation is not the exact equal and opposite of the effect of a decrease in inflation because of the effect of various caps and collars on various tranches of pension benefits for instance, some pension increases are capped at the lower of LPI and 2.5%, as noted above.
The effect of increasing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2% or 22m, and would increase total service cost by around 0.3m or 1.6%.
The sensitivities above are applied to the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision at note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities.
The timing of outflows from the provision is variable, and is dependent on property lease expiry dates, on opportunities to surrender leases, and on the timing of dilapidations assessments and works.
In the prior period there was an increase of 0.1m to one element of the property provision which was for empty properties with long leases remaining, and which related to the unwinding of the discount rate over time.
In the current year, following continued property disposals and lease expiries, the comparable charge was less than 0.1m.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Warranty provision 98 The warranty provision relates to amounts due in respect of product warranties.
As products are sold, the Group makes provision for claims under warranties.
As claims are made, the Group utilises the provision and then uses this historical data to periodically revise the basis on which it makes further provision.
Business closure provision The provision for business closure relates to the costs of closure of the former Group subsidiary company Howden Joinery Supply Division Asia Ltd.
This closure was almost entirely completed at the end of 2013, but the final small cash outflows were paid in 2014 and the small unutilised remaining provision was released.
French post-employment benefits This provision relates to a benefit which is payable to employees in our French subsidiaries under French law on retirement.
It will only be payable if any of the eligible employees are employed by our French subsidiaries immediately before their retirement.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to maximise the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance, trading-off the benefits of financial leverage with the expected future costs of financial distress.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt including the borrowings disclosed in note 20 offset by cash and short-term investments and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent including issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and in note 23.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure regularly, including, but not limited to, at the time of preparing annual budgets, preparing three-year corporate plans, and considering corporate transactions.
As part of this review, the Board reviews the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs, taking on or issuing new debt or repaying any existing debt.
At the period end, the Group had a 140m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on three sub-facilities stock, trade receivables, and a cash flow facility.
The facility limit is the lower of 140m and the sum of the sub-facilities.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business: ii allows up to 10m of additional secured borrowings, and iii allows up to 20m of finance lease borrowing.
The facility expires in July 2016.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 b Significant accounting policies 109 Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
c Categories of financial instruments 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Financial assets current and non-current Trade receivables 102.9 96.3 Cash and cash equivalents 131.9 139.7 Current asset investments 85.0 Financial liabilities current and non-current Trade payables 80.1 70.4 Borrowings 0.8 0.8 d Financial risk management General The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantification of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below subcategorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Cash and cash equivalents 110 Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as defined immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand and current asset investments.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Current asset investments consist of UK Government Treasury Bills with an initial term to maturity of up to three months.
These investments are held to maturity and, whilst of lower liquidity than cash, will ensure that the primary Group policy objective of asset security is met.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 18. e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash, investments, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 18.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and investments through adherence to a policy of minimum short-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors A-2 and Moodys P-1.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 102.9 96.3 Cash 131.9 139.7 Current asset investments 85.0 Total credit risk exposure 319.8 236.0 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 f Liquidity risk 111 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient cash and investment reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Financial Review contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
Maturity profile of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued g Market risk 112 This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m Euro Trade receivables 1.6 1.7 Other receivables 0.8 0.6 Cash and cash equivalents 4.4 5.5 Trade payables 16.5 16.4 Other payables 0.8 0.7 10.5 9.3 US Dollar Cash and cash equivalents 3.9 Trade payables 0.8 3.8 0.8 0.1 Hong Kong Dollar Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 0.3 TOTAL 11.3 8.9 Interest rate risk The Group does not have any significant exposure to interest rate risk.
Payments on the Groups finance leases are fixed on inception of the lease contract, and as such are regarded as fixed rate borrowings.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 h Financial instrument sensitivities 113 Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would remain the same 2013: remain the same.
For a decrease of 50 basis points, the current year figures would remain the same 2013: remain the same.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, and US dollar exchange rates.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, and the US Dollar.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the end of the financial period, and based on the outstanding foreign currency balances at the period end.
27 December 2014 28 December 2013 m m 10% weakening of Sterling to Euro 1.2 1.0 10% strengthening of Sterling to Euro 1.0 0.8 10% weakening of Sterling to US dollar 0.1 10% strengthening of Sterling to US dollar 0.1 The Groups sensitivity, on the basis above, to a strengthening or weakening of Sterling to the Hong Kong Dollar was less than 0.1m at both the current and prior period ends.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 114 There were no discontinued operations in the prior period.
All discontinued operations in the current period are discontinued exceptional items, and are analysed as follows: 52 weeks to 27 December 2014 Note m Increase to discontinued operations property provision a 2.2 Release of discontinued interest accrual b 0.1 Exceptional item loss on discontinued operations 2.1 Release of tax creditor for discontinued operations c 11.1 Tax credit on increase to discontinued operations property provision a 0.1 Exceptional profit after tax 9.1 a Increase to discontinued property provisions During the current period, we have increased the provision for our remaining legacy properties.
b Release of discontinued interest accrual In prior periods, the Group had been accruing for possible interest which would be due in relation to overdue tax in the event that we were unsuccessful in our dispute with HMRC relating to discontinued operations see c below.
Following the partial resolution of this dispute in the current period, we now have certainty that some of this accrual will no longer be needed.
We have therefore released this amount in the current period.
c Release of tax creditor for discontinued operations During the current period, we received a First Tier Tribunal judgement which gave a partial resolution of a dispute with HMRC, regarding the tax treatment of certain expenses relating to our legacy properties which had been incurred in prior periods.
In prior years, we had prepared our tax computations for accounts purposes on the basis that the disputed expense items would not be deductible for tax, and we provided for tax on that basis.
Now that the judgement has given us certainty that particular expenses may be treated as deductible for tax, we are recognising a credit of 11.1m of tax in the current period.
