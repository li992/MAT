Iain Conn The Companys share of the total Group surplus or deficit at the end of the reporting period for each scheme is calculated in proportion to the Companys share of ordinary employer contributions in to that scheme during the year: ordinary employer contributions are determined by the Chief Executive pensionable pay of the Companys employees within the scheme and the cash contribution rates set by the scheme trustees.
Current service cost is calculated with reference to the pensionable pay of the Companys employees.
The Companys share of the total Group interest on scheme liabilities, The notes on pages 167 to 173 form part of these Financial Statements, along with note 25 to the Group Financial Statements.
expected return on scheme assets and actuarial gains or losses is calculated in proportion to ordinary employer contributions in the prior accounting period.
Changes in the surplus or deficit arising as a result of the changes in the Companys share of total ordinary employer contributions are also treated as actuarial gains or losses.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
