80 Accounts Notes to the Accounts 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are entirely based in its country of domicile, the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence the Group has one reportable segment which is UK housebuilding.
As there continues to be only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Chief Executives Operating Review on page 23.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole, which are based in the UK, when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

5 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories was performed at 31 July 2014 and the carrying value of land was compared to the net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs ofcompletion and attributable overheads.
Estimated selling prices and costs to complete were reviewed on a site by site basis and selling prices were amended based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
Noexceptional land write-downs or land write backs were required as a result of this review.
There were no exceptional items in the year ended 31 July 2013.

At the year end a tax rate reduction to 20%, effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted.
The corporation tax rate reduced from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013, and to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014.
A furtherreduction to 20%, effective from 1 April 2015, will reduce the Groups current tax charge accordingly.
The effective income tax expense is 22.2% of profit before taxation 2013 23.0% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 22.3% 2013 23.7%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to enhanced tax deductions received by the Group in relation to land remediation relief.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.

They are valued under the cost model and are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
A formal internal valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year.
The fair value of the investment properties was assessed at 7.450 million 2013 7.697 million.
Investment properties are held at cost and categorised as level 3 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised as defined within the standard.
The fair value is calculated on the same basis as other financial assets see notes 14 and 18.

In the ordinary course of business inventories have been written back by a net 11.8 million 2013 3.2 million in the year.
There has been no exceptional write-down of inventories in the period 2013 nil as outlined in note 5 on page 81.
Land with a carrying value of 66.4 million 2013 53.2 million was used as security for land payables note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.
14 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS 2014 2013 Group 000 000 At 1 August 34,484 35,080 Additions 72 1,128 Redemptions 2,526 1,849 Imputed interest 156 125 At 31 July 32,186 34,484 Other financial assets carried at fair value are categorised as level 3 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised asdefined within the standard.
Other financial assets comprise loans, largely with non fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded atfair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of significant unobservable inputs including future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
At31 July 2014 the estimated fair value of these assets included an allowance for low single-digit price inflation.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is charged over the estimated deferred term tocost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Theimputed interest credited to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2014 was 0.156 million 2013 0.125 million.
Credit risk, which the directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 July 2014 2013 nil.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2013 nil.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors consider at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 31 July 2014 or 31 July 2013 and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the Statement of Comprehensive Income to date.
The Company has no other financial assets.

b The shares were redeemable by the Company at any time at a sum calculated by reference to the yield on 12% Exchequer Stock 2013 2017 provided such sum was neither less than the nominal value nor more than twice the nominal value of the shares.
All shares still in issue were redeemed at par on 7 April 2014. c I n the event of a winding up of the Company, the preference shareholders were entitled to a preferential payment in addition to any arrears of dividend, equivalent to the nominal value of the preference shares, or in the event of a voluntary winding up, an amount per share calculated by reference to the yield on 12% Exchequer Stock 2013 2017, provided such sum was neither less than the nominal value nor more than twice the nominal value of the shares.
d T he preference shareholders had no ordinary voting rights except in circumstances where the fixed dividend on the preference shares was six months in arrears or where the business of a general meeting included the consideration of certain resolutions as defined in the Articles of Association relating to winding up, changes in the rights of preference shareholders or failure by the Company to redeem the preference shares by 7 April 2014.

18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables, other financial assets and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash, other receivables and amounts owed by Group undertakings following the repayment of the preference shares on 7 April 2014.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through reinvested profits, bank borrowings, cash in hand and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and housing market risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 About Us 01 05 89 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and reinvested profit and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two-year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined in the Report of the Directors are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on LIBOR.
For the year ended 31 July 2014 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would increase the Groups profit before taxation by 0.122 million 2013 decrease profit before taxation by 0.649 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
At 31 July 2014 it is estimated that if forecast UK house price inflation had been 1% lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of taxation, by 3.0 million 2013 3.0 million with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
Adjustments to the house price inflation assumption in the fair value model would have an effect on the fair value of the assets.
Additionally, whilst not easily assessable in advance, changes to house price inflation levels may affect the likelihood of these assets being redeemed, further affecting their fair value.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the deferred creditor is initially recorded at fair value, being the price paid for the land discounted to present day, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 1 2 years 2 5 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2014 247,987 253,826 188,114 41,973 23,739 At 31 July 2013 146,019 150,551 108,403 18,064 21,442 2,642 Bellway p. l. c.

The imputed interest rate on land payables reflects market interest rates available to the Group on floating rate bank loans at the time of acquiring the land.
At the year end, the Group had 270.0 million 2013 270.0 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
Cash and cash equivalents This comprises cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity date of less than one month.
The amounts of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended 31 July 2014 and 31 July 2013 for both the Group and the Company are shown in note 22.
At 31 July 2014 the average interest rate earned on the temporary closing cash balance was 0.51% 2013 0.48%.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS a Retirement benefit obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension Scheme the Scheme which has a funded defined benefit arrangement which is closed to new members and to future service accrual.
The Group also sponsors the Bellway plc 2008 Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP which is a defined contribution contract-based arrangement.
Contributions of 2.858 million 2013 2.238 million were charged to the income statement for the GSIPP.
Defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.
Role of Trustees The Scheme is managed by the Trustees, who are appointed by either the Company or the members.
The role of the Trustees is to manage the Scheme in line with the Scheme trust deed and rules, to act prudently, responsibly and honestly, impartially and in the interests of all beneficiaries.
The main responsibilities of the Trustees are to agree with the employer the level of contributions to the Scheme and to make sure these are paid, to decide how the Schemes assets are invested so the Scheme is able to meet its liabilities, and to oversee that the payment of benefits, record keeping and administration of the Scheme complies with the Scheme trust deed and rules and legislation.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 August 2011 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2014.
A full actuarial valuation as at 1 August 2014 is underway.
With regard to the Scheme, regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year were 1.2 million 20131.2 million.
The employer also paid special contributions amounting to 1.32 million 2013 nil.
The Group paid a special contribution of 3.2 million in August 2014 and expects to pay no regular contributions to the Scheme during the year ending 31 July 2015, subject to the results of the full actuarial valuation as at 1 August 2014.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 94 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members of occupational pension schemes: to promote, and to improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes: to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund: and to maximise employer compliance with employer duties and the employment safeguards introduced by the Pensions Act 2008.
Risk The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant are: RISK DESCRIPTION Asset volatility The Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
However, a significant proportion of the Schemes assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities, that would be expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term but create volatility and risk in the short-term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, with higher inflation increasing the liabilities.
However, there are caps of either a 3% p. a. or 5% p. a. increase in place to limit the effect of higher inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes liabilities are to provide a pension for the life of the member, withany increase in life expectancy also increasing the Schemes defined benefit obligation.

All government bonds are issued by European governments and are AAA rated.
Actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date: 2014 2013 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 4.20 4.60 Future salary increases 3.90 4.05 Allowance for pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p. a. if less 3.40 3.55 Allowance for deferred pension increases of CPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.40 2.85 50% of 50% of Allowance for commutation of pension for cash at retirement maximum maximum The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 July 2014 are based on the SIPxA tables and allow for future improvement in mortality.
The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2014 23.4 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2014 25.7 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2034 25.6 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2034 28.0 years Sensitivities The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises the effect on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if different assumptions were used: Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities % Discount rate -0.25% p. a.
Increase by 4.3% Future salary increases 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 0.8% Inflation RPI 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 3.7% Mortality 1 year life expectancy Increase by 2.6% The calculations for the sensitivity analysis are not as accurate as a full valuation carried out using these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 96 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED b Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, a share matching plan SMP, an annual bonus scheme, employee share option schemes ESOS and Savings Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS, all of which are detailed below.
Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors and the Group Company Secretary, with awards underthe annual bonus scheme also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under these schemes.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 55 and 58 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level, under the term of the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 normally for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed overleaf, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share-based payments is as follows: LTIP, SMP and annual bonus 2014 2013 Number of Number of options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 251,219 330,064 Granted during the year 114,812 108,962 Lapsed during the year 71,629 187,807 Outstanding at the end of the year 294,402 251,219 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,000 The options outstanding at 31 July 2014 have a weighted average contractual life of 1.5 years 2013 1.7 years.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 About Us 01 05 97 Strategic Report 06 35 Governance 36 69 Accounts 70 98 Other Information 99 112 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Valuation methodology For the LTIP options granted prior to 24 October 2011, a Monte Carlo simulation method was used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of TSR, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities were calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, was also used.
For LTIP and SMP options granted after 24 October 2011 half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
The inputs into the models for the various grants in the current and previous year were as follows: 2014 2013 November November November December November November November November 2013 2013 2013 2013 2012 2012 2012 2012 Scheme description SMP 3 Year 5 Year LTIP SMP 3 Year 5 Year LTIP SRSOS SRSOS SRSOS SRSOS Grant date 28 Nov 13 15 Nov 13 15 Nov 13 17 Dec 13 23 Nov 12 16 Nov 12 16 Nov 12 13 Nov 12 Risk free interest rate 0.9% 0.9% 1.7% 0.0% 0.4% 0.4% 0.8% 0.0% Exercise price 1,218.4p 1,218.4p 805.6p 805.6p Share price at date of grant 1,446.0p 1,406.0p 1,406.0p 1,472.0p 967.5p 951.0p 951.0p 969.0p Expected dividend yield n a 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% n a 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% Expected life 3 years 3 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 5 years 3 years 2 months 2 months 2 months 2 months Vesting date 28 Nov 16 1 Feb 17 1 Feb 19 17 Dec 16 23 Nov 15 1 Feb 16 1 Feb 18 13 Nov 15 Expected volatility 30% 30% 35% 30% 30% 30% 45% 30% Fair value of option 735p 315p 409p 708p 535p 215p 336p 501p The expected volatility for all models was determined by considering the volatility levels historically for the Group.
