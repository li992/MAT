These goodwill amounts by acquired operations are not individually material.
The aggregate goodwill impairment of 120 million at 31 December 2014 and 2013 relates to the goodwill held in relation to the held for sale Japan life business see note D1, which was impaired in 2005.
Impairment testing Goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
These cash-generating units are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Assessment of whether goodwill may be impaired Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the cash-generating units carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount.
With the exception of M&G, the goodwill attributable to shareholders mainly relates to acquired life businesses.
The Company routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of acquired life business with the value of the business as determined using the EEV methodology, as described in note 16.
Any excess of IFRS over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired.
The assumptions underpinning the Groups EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.
M&G The recoverable amount for the M&G cash-generating units has been determined by calculating its value in use.
This has been calculated by aggregating the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the M&G operating segment based upon management projections.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on a three-year plan prepared by M&G, and approved by management, and cash flow projections for later years.
The value in use is particularly sensitive to a number of key assumptions as follows: i The set of economic, market and business assumptions used to derive the three-year plan.
The direct and secondary effects of recent developments, eg changes in global equity markets, are considered by management in arriving at the expectations for the financial projections for the plan: ii The assumed growth rate on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the plan.
A growth rate of 2.5 per cent 2013: 2.5 per cent has been used to extrapolate beyond the plan period representing managements best estimate view of the long-term growth rate of the business after considering the future and past growth rates and external sources of data: iii The risk discount rate.
Differing discount rates have been applied in accordance with the nature of the individual component businesses.
For retail and institutional business, a risk discount rate of 12 per cent 2013: 12 per cent has been applied to post-tax cash flows.
The pre-tax risk discount rate was 16 per cent 2013: 18 per cent.
Management have determined the risk discount rate by reference to an average implied discount rate for comparable UK listed asset managers calculated by reference to risk-free rates, equity risk premiums of 5 per cent and an average beta factor for relative market risk of comparable UK listed asset managers.
A similar approach has been applied for the other component businesses of M&G: and iv That asset management contracts continue on similar terms.
Management believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of M&G to fall below its carrying amount.

Note PVIF and other intangibles comprise PVIF, distribution rights and other intangibles such as software rights.
Distribution rights relate to amounts that have been paid or have become unconditionally due for payment as a result of past events in respect of bancassurance partnership arrangements in Asia.
These agreements allow for bank distribution of Prudentials insurance products for a fixed period of time.
Additions of 865 million in 2014 principally relate to fees paid and due to extend the term and expand the geographic scope of the agreement with Standard Chartered Bank and other fees on current distribution deals.
It also includes 18 million for PVIF and other intangibles in 2014 for the acquisition of Express Life of Ghana and Shield Assurance Company Limited in Kenya.
 Summary balances The DAC amount in respect of US insurance operations comprises amounts in respect of: 2014 m 2013 m Variable annuity business 5,002 3,716 Other business 759 868 Cumulative shadow DAC for unrealised gains booked in other comprehensive income 584 463 Total DAC for US operations 5,177 4,121 Consequent upon the positive unrealised valuation movement in 2014 of 956 million 2013: negative unrealised valuation movement of 2,089 million, there is a charge of 87 million 2013: a credit of 498 million for altered shadow DAC amortisation booked within other comprehensive income.
These adjustments reflect movement from period to period, in the changes to the pattern of reported gross profits that would have happened if the assets reflected in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising the unrealised gains and losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.
At 31 December 2014, the cumulative shadow DAC balance as shown in the table above was negative 584 million 2013: negative 463 million.
222 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C5:  Overview of the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs for Jackson Under IFRS 4, the Group applies grandfathered US GAAP for measuring the insurance assets and liabilities of Jackson.
In the case of Jackson term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with a combination of historical and future expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For fixed interest rate and fixed index annuity and interest-sensitive life business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
Expected gross profits also depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expense experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
Acquisition costs for Jacksons variable annuity products are also amortised in line with the emergence of profits.
The measurement of the amortisation in part reflects current period fees including those for guaranteed minimum death, income, or withdrawal benefits earned on assets covering liabilities to policyholders, and the historical and expected level of future gross profits which depends on the assumed level of future fees, as well as components related to mortality, lapse, expense and the long-term cost of hedging.
Mean reversion technique For variable annuity products, under US GAAP as grandfathered under IFRS 4 the projected gross profits, against which acquisition costs are amortised, reflect an assumed long-term level of returns on separate account investments which, as referenced in note A3, for Jackson, is 7.4 per cent 2013: 7.4 per cent after deduction of net external fund management fees.
This is applied to the period end level of separate account assets after application of a mean reversion technique that removes a portion of the effect of levels of short-term variability in current market returns.
Under the mean reversion technique applied by Jackson, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted from period to period so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding two years and the current period, the 7.4 per cent 2013: 7.4 per cent annual return is realised on average over the entire eight-year period.
Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the 7.4 per cent 2013: 7.4 per cent assumption.
However, to ensure that the methodology does not over anticipate a reversion to the long-term level of returns following adverse markets, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than 0 per cent per annum after deduction of net fund management fees in each year.
Sensitivity of amortisation charge The amortisation charge to the income statement is reflected in both operating profit and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The amortisation charge to the operating profit in a reporting period comprises: i A core amount that reflects a relatively stable proportion of underlying premiums or profit: and ii An element of acceleration or deceleration arising from market movements differing from expectations.
In periods where the cap and floor feature of the mean reversion technique are not relevant, the technique operates to dampen the second element above.
Nevertheless, extreme market movements can cause material acceleration or deceleration of amortisation in spite of this dampening effect.
Furthermore, in those periods where the cap or floor is relevant, the mean reversion technique provides no further dampening and additional volatility may result.
In 2014, the DAC amortisation charge for operating profit was determined after including a charge for accelerated amortisation of 13 million 2013: credit for decelerated amortisation of 82 million.
The 2014 amount primarily reflects the separate account performance of 6 per cent, which is lower than the assumed level for the year.
As noted above, the application of the mean reversion formula has the effect of dampening the impact of equity market movements on DAC amortisation while the mean reversion assumption lies within the corridor.
It would take a significant movement in equity markets in 2015 outside the range of negative 34 per cent to positive 36 per cent for the mean reversion assumption to move outside the corridor.

The venture fund investments consolidated by the Group relates to investments of the PAC with-profits fund which are managed by M&G for which the goodwill is shown in the table above.
Goodwill is tested for impairment of these investments by comparing the investments carrying value including goodwill with its recoverable amount fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation based on cash flow projections to 2016 prepared by management after considering the historical experience and future growth rates of the business.
The key assumption applied in the calculations is the risk discount rate which were from 10 to 14 per cent.
The discount rates were derived by reference to risk-free rates and an equity premium risk.
In 2014 and 2013, there was no impairment of goodwill.

As the with-profits contracts are accounted for under the UK regulatory realistic basis, no deferred acquisition costs are established for this type of business.
Distribution rights attributable to with-profits funds of the Asia insurance operations Distribution rights relate to facilitation fees paid in relation to the bancassurance partnership arrangements in Asia for the bank distribution of Prudentials insurance products for a fixed period of time.
The distribution rights amounts are amortised over the term of the distribution contracts.
