128 NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements 2.2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The key assumptions concerning the future, key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements at the statement of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Significant judgements Functional currency The UAE Dirham is determined to be the functional currency of the Company.
Judgement has been used to determine the functional currency of the Company that most appropriately represents the economic effects of the Companys transactions, events and conditions.
As part of this assessment, the following information has been taken into account: The primary economic environment influencing the Companys income dividends is the UAE and the effect of the local environment is limited to expenses incurred within the UK.
The ability of the Company to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the economy of, and the operation of its subsidiaries in, the UAE.
2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial period.
New and amended standards and interpretations: The Company applied for the first time certain standards and amendments which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 The amendments to IFRS, which are effective as of 1 January 2014 and are described in more detail below, have no impact on the Company.
Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and must be applied retrospectively, subject to certain transition relief.
The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.
These amendments have no impact on the Company.
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 These amendments clarify the meaning of currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively.
Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required.
These amendments have no impact on the Company as the Company has no derivatives.
Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Amendments to IAS 36 These amendments remove the unintended consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement on the disclosures required under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
In addition, these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the assets or cashgenerating units CGUs for which an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period.
These amendments have no impact on the Company as the Company has not recognised or reversed any impairment loss during the period.
IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs.
For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached.
Retrospective application is required for IFRIC 21.
This interpretation has no impact on the Company.
Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle In the 2010-2012 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued seven amendments to six standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The amendment to IFRS 13 is effective immediately and, thus, for periods beginning at 1 January 2014, and it clarifies in the Basis for Conclusions that short-term receivables and payables with no stated interest rates can be measured at invoice amounts when the effect of discounting is immaterial.
This amendment to IFRS 13 has no impact on the Company.
This amendment to IFRS 13 is relevant to the Company as the Company has determined that the effect of discounting is immaterial and so short term receivables and payables have been measured at invoiced amounts.
NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 129 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle In the 2011-2013 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued four amendments to four standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
This amendment to IFRS 1 has no impact on the Company, since the Company is an existing IFRS preparer.
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investment in subsidiary Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls the operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Acquisition of subsidiary under common control When the Company acquires a subsidiary under common control, the cost of the investment is deemed to be the Companys share of the net assets of the subsidiary at the date of acquisition, Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash in hand and bank balances.
Equity The Company has issued ordinary shares that are classified as equity.
The difference between the issue price and the par value of ordinary share capital is allocated to share premium.
The transaction costs incurred for the share issue are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, net of any related income tax benefit, to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the share issue that would otherwise have been avoided.
Accounts payable and accruals Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether billed by the supplier or not.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation legal or constructive arising from a past event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the obligation.
Increases in provisions due to the passage of time are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Share based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 12.
130 NMC Health plc Annual Report 2014 Group Financial Overview Strategic Report Governance Statements 2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves other payables.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for which vesting are conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition.
These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in UAE Dirhams at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets An assessment is made at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset may be impaired.
If such evidence exists, any impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment is determined as the difference between carrying value and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

13 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Companys principal financial liabilities are other payables, arising in the normal course of business.
The Companys financial assets include an amount due from a related party and bank balances.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its bank balances only, as the balance due from a related party is interest free, and therefore the Companys exposure to interest rate risk is limited.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, leading to a financial loss.
The Companys credit risk arises from amounts due from a related party and bank balances.
The directors assess the credit quality of the related party by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by this counterparty, which is a subsidiary of the Company.
The Company limits its credit risk with regard to bank balances by only dealing with reputable banks.
The credit rating of the bank at which the cash at bank is held is AA.
The Companys credit risk exposure against a corporate guarantee provided to NMC Healthcare LLC in respect of the JP Morgan Chase loan is US$166,561,000 2013: US$225,000,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys objective is to maintain sufficient funding to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The table below analyses the Companys undiscounted financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the contractual payment dates.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

15 TAX The Group operates solely in the United Arab Emirates and as there is no corporation tax in the United Arab Emirates, no taxes are recognised or payable on the operations in the UAE.
