Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans The Group has a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan.
The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each workers earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers.
Pensions benefits accrued as at 1 July 2007, arerestated based on the National Consumer Price Index NCPI until the retirement date of each worker.
The overall investment policy and strategy for the Groups defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan.
However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded.
The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations.
The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile.
Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements.
The defined benefit contribution plan was established as from1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers contributions, capped at 8% of the employees annual salary.
Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.
