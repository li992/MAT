10 BUSINESS COMBINATION The Empress State Limited Partnership On 29 May 2013, the Group acquired control of the 50 per cent interest not already owned in The Empress State Limited Partnership ESLP, which owns and manages, through its general partner, the Empress State Building in West London.
This 451,000 square foot, 31 storey office building is adjacent to the Groups EC1 & EC2 interests and benefits from an index linked lease to the Metropolitan Police Authority until 2019.
ESLP was accounted for as a joint venture under the equity method to the date that control of the partnership was acquired by the Group.
The partnership contributed revenues of 2.4 million during the period between exchange in May and completion in August, of which 1.2 million is disclosed as being attributable to non-controlling interest.
A net profit of 1.0 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest during this time.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013 the Groups revenue and the net profit would have been 3.1 million and 7.9 million higher respectively.
The net profit amount includes revaluation gains recognised on exchange of contracts.
On the date control was acquired, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the business combination were fair valued with resulting gains or losses being taken to the Groups consolidated income statement.
No deferred tax was recognised on this date because the tax base of the underlying asset was equal to its fair value.
com 109 Notes to the accounts continued 10 BUSINESS COMBINATION CONTINUED The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination were as follows: 2013 m Non-current assets 234.0 Current assets 5.6 Current liabilities 151.8 Net assets of ESLP on acquisition of control 87.8 Disposal of investment in ESLP as joint venture 43.9 Net assets acquired 43.9 Completion of the acquisition occurred on 1 August 2013.
Consideration for the net assets acquired, including the non-controlling interest share of profits, was 45 million.
Total cash paid was 50.3 million comprising both consideration and the repayment of the joint venture partners loan account.
ESLP is now consolidated as a subsidiary of the Group.
11 DISCONTINUED OPERATION On 29 April 2013, the Group exchanged contracts for the disposal of the final asset, Park Crescent West, in The Great Capital Partnership GCP.
This was affected as part of the Groups strategy to dispose of non-core assets in support of the Groups core estates and, as a result, the partnership has been presented as a discontinued operation.
GCP was established as a joint venture in 2007 with Great Portland Estates plc GPE, to own, manage and develop a number of central London properties.

com 115 Notes to the accounts continued 16 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED At 31 December 2014, the Group was contractually committed to 100.9 million re-presented 2013: 103.9 million of future expenditure for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property.
Refer to note 33 Capital Commitments for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2014 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and Venues: and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups property portfolio.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Investment Director, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee, with the Investment Director reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs for example section 106, professional fees, planning fees, developers profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit before arriving at a valuation.
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties the Groups interests at EC1 & EC2 have been valued on the basis of a mixed use, residential led scheme, deriving a residual land valuation on the basis of a standalone development of these interests.
During 2014 the properties were used as exhibition venues, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion of existing use to residential use or for improving the configuration of retail units.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission or lease extension and renegotiation of use are required as is the case currently regarding the Empress State Building and EC1 & EC2 respectively or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Refer to disclosures surrounding development risks on page 15.
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13.
Trading property is exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements.
The different valuation levels are defined as: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets: Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices: and Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2.
All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3.

com 123 Notes to the accounts continued 27 OPERATING LEASES The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment property to tenants under operating leases.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint ventures.
The table is disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
Fixed Capped Floating Fixed Capped Floating 2014 2014 2013 2013 m m m m 1 Group borrowings excluding finance leases 150.0 298.5 368.7 Joint venture borrowings excluding finance leases 6.9 150.0 305.4 368.7 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 276.8 276.8 368.7 368.7 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 426.8 28.6 368.7 Interest rate protection 94% 100% 1 Excludes current loan notes of 6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing.
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2014 was 2.2 per cent 2013: 3.2 per cent.
Cash flow hedge: In 2014, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising on 50 million of outstanding debt from 2014 to 2024.
The gain recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was 0.3 million.
This gain will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt.
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2014 was nil.
The hedge was 100 per cent effective: therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement during the year.
124 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of 6.9 million 2013: 6.2 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of 6.9 million 2013: 6.2 million.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
b Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have significant foreign exchange exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2014.

com 125 Notes to the accounts continued 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable from joint ventures and loan notes.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
Trade and other receivables: Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2014 was 5.9 million 2013: 4.2 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2014 2013 m m Up to 90 days 7.9 5.5 Over 90 days 0.2 0.3 Trade receivables 8.1 5.8 In 2014 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of 0.4 million 2013: 0.1 million.
Loan notes: Included within receivables are 6.2 million 2013: 6.0 million of loan notes that relate to the disposal of a subsidiary in 2008.
The loan notes have been impaired by 9.8 million 2013: 10.0 million to their recoverable amount with reference to the market value of secured property assets.
Whilst uncertainty remains, the loan notes have continued to perform, all interest payments have been serviced on a timely basis during 2014 and are forecast to continue during 2015.
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: Following the adoption of IFRS 11 and the application of the equity method, loans between the Group and its joint ventures, as well as interest thereon, are no longer eliminated on consolidation.
Included within receivables is 19.1 million 2013: 18.4 million of amounts advanced to LSJV.
The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is nil 2013: nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment.
Total funding advanced to LSJV of 38.3 million 2013: 24.7 million has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture, 19.2 million 2013: 6.3 million.
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value.
However based on a market valuation undertaken by the Groups valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of 83.4 million Group share as at 31 December 2014.
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when building work is physically complete.
Therefore, while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale.
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments: The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and A.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Groups holding structure.
The Groups recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is 11.8 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 3.1 million.
A disposal of the Groups trading property including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 16 Property Portfolio would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 20.7 million 21.5 per cent of 96.3 million.
The Groups contingent tax liability which is calculated on the same basis as the IAS 12 liability above is nil 2013: nil after allowing for loss relief.

com 133 Notes to the accounts continued 39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Groups equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards.
The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2014 was 4.8 million 2013: 4.7 million.
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 134 to 136.
Performance share plan Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee at the time of grant.
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: the Groups Total Return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 69, 78 and 79.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
In general, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme: therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2014 were exercisable between nil pence and 268.1 pence and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2015 and 2024. a Market value option awards 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average market value exercise price market value exercise price options pence options pence Outstanding at 1 January 5,239,909 124.6 9,140,963 117.55 Awarded during the year 11,189 268.10 Forfeited during the year 56,944 176.3 205,275 157.73 1 Exercised during the year 2,802,325 125.7 3,706,968 105.96 Outstanding at 31 December 2,380,640 122.1 5,239,909 124.62 Exercisable at 31 December 2,369,451 3,395,981 1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 338.5 pence 2013: 339.7 pence.

Matching share plan Under the Group Matching Share Plan MSP, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.
These awards may also be made as nil cost options.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award.
Awards of nil cost options were made in both the current and comparative periods.
The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date.

The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred.
In exceptional circumstances the matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred.
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions.
Vesting of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally determined.
The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or deferred shares.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was 2.1 million 2013: 2.5 million.

The Chairman invested more than 150 per cent of his base fee in the Companys shares during 2010, and accordingly an award of 529,536 deferred shares was made to him on 1 September 2010.
The Chairmans matching share award carried no performance conditions but was subject to him remaining in office for three years and retaining ownership of the invested shares.
The shares vested in full on 10 May 2013.
The total expense recognised in the 2013 consolidated income statement in respect of the Chairmans award was 0.1 million.
The share price at the date of vesting was 327.9 pence.
Fair value of share-based payment As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition.
Inputs to the models for share awards during the year are as follows: Year of share award 2014 2013 2012 2011 Closing share price at grant date 320 350p 271p 196p 183p Exercise price 0 268p 0 176p Expected option life 3 years 3 years 5 years 4 5 years Risk-free rate 1.1 1.2% 0.24% 0.37% 0.34 2.49% Expected volatility 20.6 22.2% 21.7% 27% 27 30% 1 Expected dividend yield 0.4 0.5% 0.5% 0.8% 0.9 1.1% Average share price 344p 308p 208p 172p Value per option 82 126p 23 134p 85p 21 75p 1 Expected dividend yield is based on public pronouncements about future dividend levels: all other measures are based on historical data.

Current pension arrangements The Venues business Venues has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February 2014 and a final salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011.
The final salary section is a funded defined benefit scheme the Scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension.
On closure of the money purchase section of the Venues pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible Venues employees.
The Groups current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficit emerges.
Interest rate risk the Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
Inflation risk a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

As a result, a discount rate of 3.4 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2014 2013: 4.4 per cent.
This is higher than the rate used in prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current year.
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time to time to reflect current trends.
The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI 150%, and Year of Birth.

41 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD On 5 January 2015, the Venues business vacated EC1 & EC2 and development started on site.
Under the agreement with Transport for London TfL the Group was obliged to provide vacant possession of the exhibition halls at EC1 & EC2 prior to 31 January 2015 which was the earliest date that transfer of EC1 & EC2 to the investment vehicle, Earls Court Partnership Limited ECPL, established with TfL could be triggered.
ECPL is held 63 per cent by the Group, 37 per cent by TfL and will enable the development of EC1 & EC2 in line with the Earls Court Masterplan.
When the Groups investment properties are transferred to ECPL, TfL will simultaneously grant 999 year headleases over EC1 & EC2.
As ECPL is fully consolidated, the Groups investment property will reflect the full value of the 999 year headlease and this increase will be offset by the recognition of non-controlling interest and loan notes attributable to TfL such that the impact on the net assets attributable to owners of the Parent is neutral.
Since the year end, arrangements have been put in place such that completion will occur by the date of the interim financial statements, 30 June 2015.
On 9 January 2015, the Group acquired the freehold interest of 31-33 Bedford Street, Covent Garden for 30.0 million.
On 14 January 2015, the Group signed a 64.8 million building contract with Sir Robert McAlpine for the construction of Kings Court, Covent Garden.
