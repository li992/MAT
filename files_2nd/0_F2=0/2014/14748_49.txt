Financial Statements Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 6 6.. E Ex xc cep ept ti io on na al l i it tem ems s a an nd d c cer ert ta ai in n r ree-me mea as su ur remen ement ts s i Exceptional items In the year to 31 March 2014, the following exceptional items were recorded: Impairments and other charges: On 26 March 2014, the Group announced its intention to dispose of a number of non-core assets and businesses and to identify further operational efficiencies as part of a value programme.
This initiative was launched to allow the Group to simplify its activities in order to focus on its core businesses and to ensure the Group is well-positioned for future challenges arising from the energy trilemma of security of supply, decarbonisation and affordability.
Businesses identified for disposal included SSEs portfolio of PFI street lighting contracts and other businesses such as the data centre activity in Telecoms and the gas connections business which is part of the capital recycling programme.
The Group also announced its decision to scale back its commitment in relation to offshore wind projects including its share of the Galloper, Seagreen and Forewind joint ventures.
The announcement also referred to a programme of voluntary early release which would have the effect of reducing headcount by around 500 employees across all business areas.
A number of these assets and businesses have been designated as held for sale and are disclosed as such on the face of the balance sheet and at Note 18c.
In addition to this, the Group has conducted a further significant review of its operational plant with a specific focus on thermal power generation plant and gas storage facilities.
These plants are considered to be at specific risk due to ongoing low spark spreads, increasing uncertainty over coal generation viability, changes arising from market reform including the creation of a Capacity Market in 2018 and the Supplemental Balancing Reserve and the ongoing economic issues associated with gas storage.
The Group has therefore recognised exceptional charges in respect of thermal generation plant of 238.4m and gas storage facilities of 137.7m, including the impairment of goodwill 26.2m and the impairment of its interest in thermal generation jointly controlled entities of 15.7m.
Following the announcement of its intentions relating to offshore wind developments, certain impairments and charges of 125.5m have been recognised in relation to renewable wind development including 20.0m in relation to goodwill.
In addition, the group has recognised impairment charges of 36.2m across its energy supply and metering business in respect of development expenditure associated with system and software development.
Other exceptional charges of 132.1m were recognised in relation to the 26 March 2014 announcement including a restructuring provision of 52.9m, associated with both the voluntary early release scheme and other business closures, and the recognition of losses and costs associated with exit from non-core businesses of 79.2m.
A provision for the settlement of a contractual dispute, of 46.4m, was also recognised.
In total, the exceptional charges associated with the 26 March 2014 announcement were 257.6m being the 132.1m noted and the combined 125.5m associated with the scaling back of renewable wind developments.
In the year to 31 March 2013, the following exceptional items were recorded: Impairments and other charges: Following a comprehensive review of generation operations, it was announced that around 2,000MW of the Groups thermal generation capacity would close in the current financial year with the main stations affected being Ferrybridge, Keadby, Slough, Uskmouth and Peterhead.
Related to this, the Group reassessed the carrying value of its associate investments at Barking Power Limited and Derwent Cogeneration Limited.
As a result, combined impairment charges of 306.9m were recognised.
In addition, impairment charges of 84.6m were recognised in relation to legacy metering assets, wind development pipeline assets, certain associate investments and other assets.
The Group also recognised exceptional charges following the settlement of contractual claims 43.0m and in relation to the impairment of carbon dioxide emissions allowances purchased to cover the emissions liabilities at the Groups thermal plants 139.3m.
Provisions for onerous contracts, restructuring and other liabilities.
On review of the Groups provisions at 31 March 2013, certain provisions for onerous contracts were released 37.4m and other provisions were recognised 44.3m.
ii Certain re-measurements Certain re-measurements arising from IAS 39 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
This category includes the movement on derivatives and hedged items as described in Note 33.
Only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only commodity contracts that are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 that are accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in the Income Statement as part of certain re-measurements or in other comprehensive income.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
iii Change in UK corporation tax rates The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate would reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years starting in 2011.
Subsequent Budgets have accelerated the reductions and the 2013 Budget on 20 March 2013 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% by 2015.
A reduction in the rate from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2013 and substantive enactment of the rates of 21% and 20% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015, respectively, took place on 3 July 2013.
As the changes have been substantively enacted, they have had the effect of reducing the Groups net deferred tax liabilities recognised at 31 March 2014 by 33.6m with an income statement impact of 52.6m and the Groups share of associate and jointly controlled investment deferred tax liabilities by 70.5m.
The income statement impact of the reduction in rate from 24% to 23% effective in the previous year was recorded as 22.0m and with 23.8m being the impact in relation to the Groups share of jointly controlled entity deferred tax.
