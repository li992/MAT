Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Payments are expected to continue on these properties for periods of 1 to 78 years 2013: 1 to 56 years.
In the current period the net provision made of 28.0 million has been classified as a non-underlying item note 4.
25 Retirement benefits During the period the Group contributed to a funded defined benefit pension plan and a number of defined contribution plans.
Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Defined contribution plans 4.3 3.8 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 81 Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 4 October 2014 25 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit plan The Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme is a final salary pension plan which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The plan closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014 and the link to future salary increases was also removed.
The plan operates under the UK regulatory framework and is governed by a board of Trustees composed of plan participants and representatives of the Group.
The Trustees make investment decisions and set the required contribution rates based on independent actuarial advice.
The key risks to which the plan exposes the Group are as follows: Volatility of plan assets Changes in bond yields Inflation risk Changes in life expectancy The movements in the fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the period were: Present value Fair value of defined Net surplus of plan assets benefit obligation deficit 2013 2013 2013 2014 Restated 2014 Restated 2014 Restated m m m m m m At beginning of the period 427.8 390.4 432.9 414.9 5.1 24.5 Current service cost 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 Interest income expense 18.6 17.1 18.5 17.9 0.1 0.8 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets excluding interest income 14.0 22.1 14.0 22.1 Effect of changes in demographic assumptions 0.4 0.4 Effect of changes in financial assumptions 26.2 16.3 26.2 16.3 Past service cost 12.9 1.4 12.9 1.4 Cashflows: Employer contributions 15.2 15.8 15.2 15.8 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Administrative expenses paid from plan assets 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.7 Benefits paid 21.5 17.0 21.5 17.0 At end of the period 453.6 427.8 445.8 432.9 7.8 5.1 Pension costs recognised in the income statement A credit of 10.8 million 2013: charge of 0.7 million comprising the current service cost and the past service cost is included within employee costs note 5 and a charge of 0.5 million 2013: 1.5 million comprising the net interest on the net defined benefit asset liability and the administrative expenses paid from plan assets is included within finance costs and income note 6.
A negative past service cost of 11.2 million 2013: nil was recognised in the current period due to the closure of the plan to future accrual at 30 September 2014 and the cutting of the link to future salary increases with effect from this date.
The net credit of 10.8 million comprising this negative past service cost less the associated costs of 0.4 million has been classed as a non-underlying item note 4.
An updated actuarial valuation of the plan was performed by Mercer as at 4 October 2014 for the purposes of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.0% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.6% 3.7% Rate of increase in pensions 5% LPI 3.0% 3.1% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% LPI 2.1% 2.1% Inflation assumption RPI 3.1% 3.2% Inflation assumption CPI 2.1% 2.2% Employed deferred revaluation 2.1% N A Life expectancy for active and deferred members from age 65 years Male 23.6 23.5 Female 26.0 25.9 Life expectancy for current pensioners from age 65 years Male 21.8 21.7 Female 24.1 23.9 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for plan experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
82 Marston's PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 25 Retirement benefits continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal actuarial assumptions is: Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 4.3% Increase by 4.6% Inflation assumption 0.25% Increase by 2.4% Decrease by 2.0% Life expectancy One year Increase by 2.7% Decrease by 2.7% The above sensitivity analyses have been determined by changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
This is unlikely to be the case in practice as changes in some of the assumptions could be correlated.
When calculating the above sensitivities the same method has been applied as when calculating the net defined benefit asset liability in the balance sheet i. e. the present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Equities Properties 197.2 190.1 Bonds Gilts 203.6 187.5 Cash Other 4.8 3.4 Buy-in policy matching annuities 48.0 46.8 453.6 427.8 The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 32.6 million 2013: 39.2 million.
A proportion of the defined benefit obligation has been secured by a buy-in policy and as such this proportion of liabilities is matched by annuities.
The Trustees of the plan hold a range of assets and are aiming to better align the cash flows from these to those of the plan.
They are also currently working with the Group to fide-risk their portfolio further.
The Group is aiming to eliminate the plans funding deficit by 2017.
During the current period the contribution rate was 22.3% and lump sums of 1.1 million per month were paid into the plan.
Following the closure of the plan to future accrual the only contributions to the plan will comprise lump sum contributions.
The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 September 2014.
The current agreed employer contributions expected to be paid during the financial period ending 3 October 2015 amount to 13.8 million, subject to discussions as part of the triennial valuation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18 years.
Post-retirement medical benefits A gain of 0.1 million 2013: 0.1 million in respect of the remeasurement of post-retirement medical benefits has been included in the statement of comprehensive income.
