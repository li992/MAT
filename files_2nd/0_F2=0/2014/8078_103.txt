The application of these tax rules to the Group has not been to disallow the tax deductibility of any interest but, as a result of the Group structure, to defer the taxation of an amount of interest income.
It is uncertain as to whether the Group will be able to continue to defer the taxation of the interest income, and therefore the income has now been taxed and the deferred tax liability released.
Interest is now expected to be taxed on an accruals basis
