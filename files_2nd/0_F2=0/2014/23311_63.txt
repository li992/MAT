Investments The portfolio comprises investments which are listed, or traded on a recognised stock exchange, and a small proportion of investments which are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.
Gains and losses in the year are either: realised, usually arising when investments sold: or unrealised, being the difference from cost on those investments still held at the year end.
