Growth in demand from major remainder was sold to a third party.
Key operational improvements in 2014 aircraft manufacturers, driven by renewal of from Russian & CIS customers generally targeted the overall maintenance system in airline fleets around the world, had a positive remained strong during 2014, with order to maximise the availability of key impact on sales of vanadium-aluminium: a ferrovanadium sales volumes growing by equipment and optimise both yields and significant component in EVRAZs specialty 7.6% when compared to 2013. throughput.
As a result, EVRAZ Vametco products.
Together with research centres in produced 3,206 tonnes of modified vanadium the USA and China, EVRAZ continues to work EVRAZ Nikom maintained stable production oxide in 2014 a 25% increase compared to to find potential applications for vanadium in in 2014 and increased vanadium yields.

Both projects are expected to Sales be fully operational in 2015.
A number of Outlook labour optimisation initiatives were carried In 2014, EVRAZs external and intersegment Vanadium consumption and prices are out during the year to improve productivity sales of vanadium products decreased by expected to continue to be largely driven by and secure cost savings.
This was largely due to the stagnation trends in the steel market.
Due to the launch of the Japanese economy and steep of new projects in 2015, vanadium supply In 2014, EVRAZ Nikom produced 4,803 deterioration of steel fundamentals in growth is expected to slightly outpace tonnes of ferrovanadium, 1% less compared China during H2 2014 which reduced the demand.
The European economic outlook to 2013, due to unforeseen feedstock supply attractiveness of the Asian markets.

Growth in Chinese accounted for 80% of EVRAZ Nikoms total negative impact by reallocating material to exports of vanadium products may put an sales volume, with the remainder sold in Asia other regions.

EVRAZs third party sales of vanadium EVRAZ production is expected to grow EVRAZ Stratcor enjoyed a stable supply of products in Russia grew by 11% driven by in 2015, mainly driven by the output of internally-sourced feedstock.
The reduced growth in consumption by the large diameter Nitrovan, a Groups proprietary product use of feedstock from other sources resulted pipe LDP and the thick plate sectors.
Sales with advanced technological properties that in improved reagent utilisation and oxides in Europe increased by 6% due to the growth is recognised by a growing number of recovery rates, helping to cut oxides of the construction and automotive sectors steel producers.
