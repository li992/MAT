Melrose Industries PLC 108 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are recognised at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year and are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of the parent undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period to the effective date of disposal.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained on page 49 of the Finance Directors review.
Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where specific guidance is provided by IFRSs.
Non-current assets and directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Also, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: Income taxes, liabilities and assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised : Employee benefits and liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payments awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2: Share-based payment.
Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts where appropriate.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may beimpaired.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 109 Annual Report 2014 Financials As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units acquired.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill relating to the operation disposed of is taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation.
The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial disposal is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business over which the Group exercises joint control.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales related taxes.
Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
The nature of agreements into which the Group enters means that: the contracts usually contain discrete elements, each of which transfers risks and rewards to the customer.
Where such discrete elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods.
the service element of the contract is usually insignificant in relation to the total contract value and is often provided on a short-term or one-off basis.
Where this is the case, revenue is recognised when the service is complete.
aftermarket activities generally relate to the provision of spare parts, repairs and the rebuild of equipment.
Revenue on the provision of parts is recognised in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods and revenue for repairs and rebuild is recognised upon completion of the activity.
The significant majority of the Groups revenue is recognised on a sale of goods basis.
The specific methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are as follows: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods: the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably: it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group: and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale.
Sales made under internationally accepted trade terms are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary duties required to transfer risks as stipulated in those terms.
Sales made outside such terms are generally recognised on delivery to the customer.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Provision of services As noted above, because revenue from the rendering of services is usually not significant in relation to the total contract value and is generally provided on a short-term or one-off basis, revenue is usually recognised when the service is complete.
Construction contracts As noted above, customer contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.
Where such discrete elements are not in place, revenue from significant contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms and the costs incurred on the contract at the Balance Sheet date in comparison to the total forecast costs of the contract.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Melrose Industries PLC 110 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable.
Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the variation or acknowledged liability for the variation in principle.
Claims are included when negotiations with the customer have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim.
Incentive payments are included when a contract is sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
Where this is not the case contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recovered.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Exceptional costs income Exceptional costs income are those costs income of a significant and non-recurring nature or those associated with significant restructuring programmes, acquisitions or disposals, which warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Headline operating profit Headline operating profit is stated before exceptional operating costs, exceptional operating income and intangible asset amortisation.
Headline operating profit is considered by the Directors to be the best measure of performance.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the issue costs of borrowings is allocated to periods over the terms of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land nil Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years Short leasehold property over the term of the lease Plant and equipment 3-12 years The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 111 Annual Report 2014 Financials The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists an impairment review is performed and, where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds or costs and the carrying amount of the item is included in the Income Statement in the year that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Access to the use of brands and intellectual property are valued using a relief from royalty method which determines the net present value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value of the future additional cash flows arising from customer relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows: Customer relationships 20 years or less Brands and intellectual property 20 years or less Computer software 5 years or less Development costs 5 years or less Computer software is initially recorded at cost.
Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting.
Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, plant and equipment.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of exploitation, adequacy of resources and a potential market or development possibility in the undertaking that are recognisable: and where it is the intention to produce, market or execute the project.
A correlation must also exist between the costs incurred and future benefits and those costs can be measured reliably.
Capitalised costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of five years or less.
Costs not meeting such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and measured using a first in, first out basis.
Cost includes all direct expenditure and appropriate production overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal operating conditions.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provisions are made for obsolescence or other expected losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
The carrying amount of other receivables is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is recorded in the Income Statement.
For trade receivables, the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account and changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement.
Melrose Industries PLC 112 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting receipts, an increase in the number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions and shortterm deposits which are readily convertible to cash which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant periods.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity risks, arising from operating and financing activities.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value.
Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date.
The accounting treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value at the period end are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss on revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one year from the period end date are classified as current in the Balance Sheet.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument and to show that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 113 Annual Report 2014 Financials Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Fair value hedge Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedge Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to the variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted cash flow.
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement or when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting period end is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of or when the hedge is no longer expected to occur.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Restructurings A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by either starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Warranties Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups obligation.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Environmental liabilities Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated.
Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action.
The amount recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required.
Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Melrose Industries PLC 114 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement benefits is described below.
The Group also operates long-term incentive plans LTIPs for Directors and certain employees.
The expected settlement costs of these plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be made to administered funds separate from the Group.
For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities.
Any assets resulting from this calculation are limited to past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement benefits to employees for the period is charged to the Income Statement.
Net interest expense on net defined benefit obligations is determined by applying discount rates used to measure defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year to net defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year.
Net interest expense is recognised within finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable and the return on plan assets excluding interest.
Remeasurement gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently recycled.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan obligations and actual experience during the period, or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan obligations.
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as an operating expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income Statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the related operation is disposed of.
Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised but they are not reclassified to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 115 Annual Report 2014 Financials Taxation The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except: where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except: where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the relevant Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and not in the Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: Share-based payment.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Directors best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Melrose Industries PLC 116 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Government grants Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In applying the Groups accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made critical accounting judgements regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition, the valuation of intangibles, the impairment of non-current assets, the quantification of provisions, the valuation of retirement benefit obligations and in respect of taxation.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ from those assumptions and estimates.
An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is provided below.
Fair values at acquisition Following the acquisition of Eclipse, Inc. Eclipse, management has made judgements regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed particularly in relation to provisions and intangible assets.
The fair value of these assets and liabilities are shown in note 12.
Valuation of intangibles In accordance with IFRS 3: Business combinations intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value.
These fair values have been estimated using income based valuation methods.
These valuation methods estimate the price that an asset could be sold for in an arms length transaction on the basis of the assets expected future income stream.
These estimates are based upon market data in order to reconstruct the measurement process a typical market participant would implement.
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of future cash flows arising from customer relationships after estimating the attrition factor relevant to the customer relationship and other factors such as access to the workforce, which are appropriate to the determination of the additional cash flows.
The valuation of intangible assets in respect of brands and intellectual property requires management to estimate future cash flows using a relief from royalty model.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 117 Annual Report 2014 Financials Impairment of non-current assets Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired and at least annually.
Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management.
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value.
Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as short and medium-term business plans.
Management draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets not including computer software and development costs at the Balance Sheet date was 2,380.7 million 31 December 2013: 2,587.9 million.
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group recognised no impairment loss in respect of these assets.
Provisions The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions environmental remediation obligations and future costs and settlements in relation to certain legal claims have been estimated using the best information available.
However, such liabilities depend on the actions of third parties and on the specific circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group.
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for managements best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided.
Further details are set out in note 20.
Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefits are accounted for under IAS 19 revised : Employee benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at the discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising under the plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial assumptions.
Therefore, declining returns on equity markets and markets for fixed-income instruments could necessitate additional contributions to the plans in order to cover future pension obligations.
Also, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life of participants may have an impact on the amount of pension income or expense recorded in the future.
The discount rate used to discount retirement benefit obligations to present value is derived from the yields of senior, high-quality corporate bonds at the Balance Sheet date.
These generally include AA-rated securities.
The discount rate is based on the market yield of a portfolio of bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
Pension and other retirement benefits are inherently long-term and future experience may differ from the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations.
Note 23 to these consolidated financial statements describes the principal discount rate, earnings increase and pension retirement benefit obligation assumptions that have been used to determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19 revised : Employee benefits.
The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefit obligations is clearly dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement.
The assumptions adopted are based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups retirement benefit obligation deficit was 218.5 million 31 December 2013: 219.3 million.
Taxation The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Management is required to exercise judgement in determining the Groups provision for income taxes.
Managements judgement is required in estimating tax provisions where additional current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns.
Managements judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits.
While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.

Segment information Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8: Operating segments which requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reported to the Groups Board in order to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance.
The Groups reportable operating segments under IFRS 8 are categorised as follows: Energy segment Elster segments Gas Electricity Water Elster central The Energy segment consists of the Brush business, a specialist supplier of energy industrial products to the global market.
Elster comprises the Gas, Electricity and Water segments along with their associated central costs.
These businesses serve residential and industrial metering and utilisation markets whilst providing related communications, networking and software solutions.
There are two central cost centres which are also separately reported to the Board: Central corporate 1 Central LTIPs 1 Long Term Incentive Plans.
The Central corporate cost centre contains the Melrose Group head office costs.
The Central LTIPs cost centre contains the costs associated with the five year Melrose Incentive Plan granted on 11 April 2012 and the divisional management LTIPs that are in operation across the Group.
Following the disposal of Bridon, the Lifting segment has ceased to exist and the results of this business have been included within discontinued operations.
The discontinued segment comprises the Bridon, Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and Harris businesses in 2013 and Bridon in 2014.
Transfer prices between business units are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

The costs in both years were weighted towards the recently acquired Elster businesses, notably towards Gas in 2014.
The most significant proportion of restructuring within the Gas business relates to the major closure of the Essen plant in Belgium and relocation of its Integrated Metering Solutions business, which builds metering stations, to Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
In addition, as a consequence of the closure of Essen, research and development and the production of ultrasonic meters was moved to Mainz, Germany in the year.
Initial restructuring costs following the acquisition of Eclipse were also incurred in 2014.
The restructuring costs incurred in 2013 were proportionally weighted to the Elster Electricity and Water businesses and whilst restructuring costs have been incurred within these businesses in 2014 they are focused on European operations rather than the large restructures in the North America businesses incurred in previous years.
The Group also incurred 3.7 million 2013: 0.5 million of expenses on acquisition and disposal related activities during the year.

Melrose Industries PLC 128 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the financial statements continued 12.
The most significant identified intangible asset is included within the Gas segment, is in relation to customer relationships, has a carrying amount as at 31 December 2014 of 582.8 million 31 December 2013: 647.5 million and has a remaining amortisation period of 17 years and 8 months.
The goodwill generated as a result of major acquisitions represents the premium paid in excess of the fair value of all net assets, including intangible assets, identified at the point of acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill represents the initial value that the Directors believed could be added to the acquired businesses through the application of their specialist turnaround experience.
The goodwill arising on bolt on acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses acquired, synergies as a result of the complementary nature of the business with existing Melrose businesses, the assembled workforce, technical expertise, knowhow, market share and geographical advantages afforded to the Group.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 129 Annual Report 2014 Financials The future improvements applied to the acquired businesses, achieved through a combination of revised strategic direction, operational improvements and investment, are expected to result in improved profitability of the acquired businesses during the period of ownership and are also expected to result in enhanced disposal proceeds when the acquired businesses are ultimately disposed.
The combined value achieved from these improvements is expected to be in excess of the value of goodwill acquired.
Goodwill has been allocated to the businesses, each of which comprises several cash-generating units, as follows: 1 Restated 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 m m Continuing operations Energy 201.7 207.4 Gas 1,088.2 1,072.0 Electricity 156.0 157.9 Water 75.0 78.5 Elster total 1,319.2 1,308.4 Total continuing operations 1,520.9 1,515.8 Discontinued operations 86.2 1,520.9 1,602.0 1 Restated to include the goodwill of Bridon within discontinued operations note 9.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units CGUs and use the latest approved forecasts extrapolated to perpetuity using growth rates shown below, which do not exceed the long-term growth rate for the relevant market.
The basis of these impairment tests and the key assumptions are set out in the table below: 31 December 2014 Carrying value of Pre-tax Long-term Basis of goodwill discount Period of Key assumptions applied in the growth 1 2 3 Group of CGUs valuation m rates forecast forecast cash flow projections rates Energy Value in use 201.7 10.3% 4 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.4% Gas Value in use 1,088.2 9.8% 5 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.2% Electricity Value in use 156.0 9.9% 3 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.4% Water Value in use 75.0 9.8% 3 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.5% 31 December 2013 Carrying value of Pre-tax Long-term Basis of goodwill discount Period of Key assumptions applied in the growth 1 2 3 valuation m rates forecast forecast cash flow projections rates Group of CGUs Energy Value in use 207.4 10.4% 4 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.5% Gas Value in use 1,072.0 9.8% 4 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.5% Electricity Value in use 157.9 9.8% 4 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.9% Water Value in use 78.5 10.0% 3 years Revenue growth, operating margins 2.5% 1 Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
In determining the cost of equity, the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM has been used.
Under CAPM, the cost of equity is determined by adding a risk premium to the risk free rate to reflect the additional risk associated with investing outside of lending to a country e. g. the purchase of UK Gilts.
The premium is based on an industry adjustment Beta to the expected return of the equity market above the risk free return.
The relative risk adjustment reflects the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors and geographies on average.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 2 Assumptions applied in financial forecasts The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management.
The key assumptions used in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue and operating margins likely to be achieved and the likely rates of long-term growth by market sector.
Underlying factors in determining the values assigned to each key assumption by CGU are shown below: Revenue growth and operating margins: Revenue growth assumptions in the forecast period are based on financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management, taking into account industry growth rates and management of each divisions historical experience in the context of wider industry and economic conditions.
Projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates, projections of developments in key markets, secured orders and orders likely to be achieved in the short to medium-term, given trends in the relevant market sector.
Operating margins have been forecast based on historical levels considering the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of management actions on costs.
Projected margins reflect the impact of all initiated projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Forecasts for other operating costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors.
Energy Brush is a supplier of turbogenerators for the power generation, industrial, oil & gas and offshore sectors and a leading supplier of switchgear, transformers and other power infrastructure equipment.
The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are i original equipment investments in the global power market, both new capacity mainly emerging markets and replacement capacity mainly in mature markets, ii growth in service requirements of a growing installed base, and iii new product introduction.
Independent forecasts of growth in these power generation markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Elster Elster Gas designs and manufactures gas measurement, process heat control and gas safety control equipment.
The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are i global energy consumption and the growing share for natural gas ii international legislation aimed at driving down emission levels and increasing efficiency which in turn stimulates demand for Smart meters and process heat applications.
Independent forecasts of the growth in these end markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Elster Electricity is an international metering solution provider supplying both traditional and Smart meter equipment, including applications for residential, commercial, industrial, transmission and distribution markets.
The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are i global demand for electricity metering requirements, both traditional and Smart, and ii market developments in meter data software solutions.
Independent forecasts of the growth in the meter hardware and related meter software end markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions as well as managements best estimates of the impact of residential Smart meter rollouts in the EU.
Elster Water designs and manufactures a comprehensive range of water metering solutions.
The key driver for revenues and operating margins is the global demand for water meters, both traditional and Smart.
Revenue growth assumptions have been built up with reference to past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
3 Long-term growth rates Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geography in which the CGU operates.
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and a long-term growth rate forecast published by external analysts and further take into account the international presence and the markets in which each business operates.
Financials Melrose Industries PLC 131 Annual Report 2014 Financials Sensitivity analysis A reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment.
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above the carrying value for each Group of CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each Group of CGUs to assess the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonable possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
Acquisition of businesses On 31 October 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital and obtained control of Eclipse, Inc. Eclipse for cash consideration of 97.6 million.
Eclipse is a long established manufacturer of low-temperature industrial gas combustion equipment, which complements Elster Gas expertise in high-temperature industrial gas combustion applications.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.
Fair values are provisional as of 31 December 2014 and are based on the information held to date.
Fair value m Eclipse Property, plant and equipment 5.5 Intangible assets, computer software and development costs 51.4 Inventories 5.4 Trade and other receivables 13.5 Cash and cash equivalents 1.5 Trade and other payables 17.2 Provisions 9.2 Deferred tax 12.2 Retirement benefit obligations 4.6 Current tax 0.8 Non-controlling interests 0.3 Net assets 33.0 Goodwill 64.6 Total consideration 97.6 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 97.6 Acquisition related costs included in exceptional operating costs amount to 2.3 million.
The fair value of financial assets include gross trade and other receivables of 14.3 million.
The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is 0.8 million.
Eclipse contributed 12.2 million to revenue and 1.4 million to headline operating profit for the two month period between the date of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisition of Eclipse had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues would have been approximately 1,441 million and Group headline operating profit would have been approximately 249 million.
The goodwill arising on acquisition of Eclipse is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses acquired, synergies as a result of the complementary nature of the business with Elster Gas, the assembled workforce, technical expertise, knowhow, market share and geographical advantages afforded to the Group.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Contingent liabilities of 4.5 million have been acquired in respect of warranty and legal claims and recognised within provisions.
The majority of expenditure is expected to be incurred over the next five years.
The non-controlling interests acquired are measured on the proportion of the fair value of their net assets.

As at 1 January 2014, the Group held a five year multi-currency facility split between a 355 million term loan and a 989 million revolving credit facility.
These facilities were due to mature on 29 June 2017.
On 11 July 2014, the existing facility was Amended and Extended, resulting in lower margins, greater flexibility and the facility being extended by two years, maturing on 11 July 2019.
As at 1 January 2014, the term loan was split into two tranches of 180 million and US $290 million.
As part of the Amend and Extend exercise the US $290 million term loan was converted into a US Dollar denominated revolving credit facility.
The Sterling denominated term loan is subject to mandatory repayments of 5% on July 2017, July 2018 and January 2019, adjusted for any term loan repayments made prior to these dates.
As at 1 January 2014, the revolving credit facility was split between a 741.5 million Sterling denominated multi-currency facility and a 300 million Euro denominated facility.
At 31 December 2014 the Sterling and Euro denominated facilities remain unchanged and exist along with the US $290 million facility which was converted from a term loan to a revolving credit facility during the year.
The 180 million term loan facility was fully drawn at 31 December 2014.
The drawdowns under the revolving credit facility as of this date were 11 million, US $381 million and 194 million.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under the facilities disclosed above.
A number of companies continue to be guarantors under the bank facilities.
Drawdowns under the existing facility bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Groups performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 0.75% and 1.90% 31 December 2013: range between 1.40% to 2.65%.

The provision for surplus leasehold property costs represents the estimated net payments payable over the term of these leases together with any dilapidation costs.
This is expected to result in cash expenditure over the next one to four years.
Environmental and legal costs provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination at certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims.
Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised.
Incentive plan related provisions are in respect of long-term incentive plans for divisional senior management, expected to result in cash expenditure in the next three years.
The provision for warranty related costs represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups obligations.
Warranty terms are, on average, between one and five years.
Other provisions relate primarily to costs that will be incurred in respect of restructuring programmes, usually resulting in cash spend within one year.
Where appropriate, provisions have been discounted using a discount rate of 3% 31 December 2013: 3%.

No asset was recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit streams and the effect of possible disposals in future years.
The majority of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
A deferred tax asset of 24.7 million 31 December 2013: 25.6 million was recognised on Group retirement benefit obligations, being the extent to which they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable taxable profits.
The remaining asset of 33.6 million 31 December 2013: 35.0 million relates to other temporary differences.
As at 31 December 2014, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries was 474 million 31 December 2013: 364 million on which deferred tax liabilities not recognised were 4.3 million 31 December 2013: 3.3 million.
No liability was recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Retirement benefit obligations Defined contribution plans The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees across several jurisdictions.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The total costs charged in relation to the continuing businesses during the year of 6.9 million 2013: 6.8 million represent contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans The Group sponsors defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of certain subsidiaries.
The funded defined benefit plans are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees of the funds are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the plans.
The trustees of the pension funds are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The most significant defined benefit pension plans are: The FKI UK Pension Plans, which comprise two separate independent plans: the FKI UK Pension Plan and the Brush Group 2013 Pension Plan, are defined benefit in type and are funded plans.
The plans are closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members.
At 31 December 2013 the FKI UK Pension Plans also contained the Bridon Group 2013 Pension Plan, which was disposed with Bridon on 12 November 2014.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan, which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan other than 5.0 million of unfunded liabilities.
The plan is closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members.
The FKI US Pension Plan, which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan.
During the year certain vested participants accepted lump sum offers resulting in an adjustment to past service cost of 3.5 million.
Other plans include a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe, North America and the rest of the world.
The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US.
During the year the Group terminated certain Elster US unfunded retiree medical and welfare plans, reducing gross liabilities by 4.3 million.
The costs of the Groups defined benefit plans are determined in accordance with IAS 19 revised : Employee benefits with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
In line with normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
Valuations of the FKI UK Pension Plans are based on full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2013 and updated at 31 December 2014 by independent actuaries.
The McKechnie UK Pension Plan valuation is based on a full valuation at 31 December 2011, updated at 31 December 2014 by independent actuaries.
The FKI US Pension Plan valuation is based on the US full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2013, updated at 31 December 2014 by independent actuaries.
The Group contributed 26.6 million 2013: 20.0 million to the FKI UK Pension Plans, which included 8.1 million 2013: 0.6 million to the disposed Bridon Group 2013 Pension Plan, and contributed 5.2 million 2013: 5.2 million to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan in the year ended 31 December 2014.
In 2015 the Group expects to contribute 20.0 million to the FKI UK Pension Plans and 5.2 million to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
In total, the Group expects to contribute approximately 31.4 million to its defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2015.

Mortality FKI UK Pension Plans Mortality assumptions for the most significant plans in the Group, the FKI UK Plans, as at 31 December 2014 are based on the Self Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S1 base tables with scaling factors of 110% and 105% for deferred members and pensioners respectively, which reflect the results of a mortality analysis carried out on the plans membership.
Future improvements are in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI improvement model with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% p. a. for both males and females.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.9 years 31 December 2013: 21.9 years if they are male and for a further 24.2 years 31 December 2013: 24.1 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2034 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a further 23.2 years 31 December 2013: 23.3 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.7 years 31 December 2013: 25.6 years after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are consistent with those adopted for the full valuation as at 31 December 2013.
Other plans The mortality assumptions adopted as at 31 December 2014 have been set to reflect the Groups best estimate view of life expectancies of members of each individual pension arrangement.
These mortality assumptions vary by arrangement, each assumption reflecting the characteristics of the membership of that arrangement.

All government bonds are issued by reputable governments and are generally AA rated or higher.
Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings for liability risk management.
The trustees continually review whether the chosen investment strategy is appropriate with a view to providing the pension benefits and to ensure appropriate matching of risk and return profiles.
The main strategic policies include maintaining an appropriate asset mix, managing interest rate sensitivity and maintaining an appropriate equity buffer.
Investment results are regularly reviewed.
There is no self investment other than in relevant tracker funds either in the Groups own financial instruments or property or other assets used by the Group.

The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the plan liabilities at the year end is as follows: Decrease Increase increase to decrease to Change in plan liabilities profit before tax assumption m m Discount rate Increase by 0.10% 19.3 0.5 Decrease by 0.10% 19.9 0.5 1 RPI inflation assumption Increase by 0.10% 12.2 n a Decrease by 0.10% 11.8 n a Assumed life expectancy at age 65 rate of mortality Increase by 1 year 44.6 n a Decrease by 1 year 44.6 n a 1 The RPI inflation sensitivity encompasses the impact on pension increases, where applicable.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonable possible changes to the respective assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant.
There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.
The sensitivities are based on the relevant assumptions and membership profile as at 31 December 2014 and are applied to the obligations at the end of the reporting period.
Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.
Extrapolation of these results beyond the sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate and the sensitivity analysis presented may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial assets is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 16 provides further details regarding the recovery of trade receivables.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the Groups net debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, after deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising Issued share capital, Reserves and Retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy for managing liquidity rate risk is set out in the Finance Directors review.
Fair values The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis A one percentage point rise in market interest rates for all currencies would increase decrease profit before tax by the following amounts assuming the net debt as at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
At 31 December 2014 the Group had a temporary excess position on Sterling interest rate swaps as a result of paying down debt under the Revolving Credit Facilities from the proceeds of the disposal that occurred in the year.
This position was reversed following the capital return in March 2015.
Adjusting for the capital return, the sensitivity would decrease profit after tax by 0.2 million for Sterling, 1.4 million for US Dollar and 0.1 million for Euros.

Following the Return of Capital in February 2014, the Group protected 78% of its gross debt against interest rate fluctuations through fixing the interest expense on US $246.8 million, 336.8 million and 200.0 million of debt with the use of interest rate swaps.
As a result of the Amend and Extend exercise the Group completed in July 2014 and the impact of the disposal of Bridon, the Group closed out all Euro and Sterling interest rate swaps.
In order to hedge up to 75% of interest rate exposure on the gross debt post the Return of Capital in March 2015, the Group took out new Euro, Sterling and additional US Dollar swaps.
The fixed finance cost is 0.06% 31 December 2013: 0.72% on Euro swaps, 1.05% 31 December 2013: 0.91% on Sterling swaps and the weighted blended fixed rate for US Dollar swaps is 0.92% 31 December 2013: 0.70%, plus the bank margin of 1.30%.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2014.
The fair value of the contracts at 31 December 2014 was a net liability of 0.9 million 31 December 2013: net asset of 5.6 million.
Foreign currency risk The Groups policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Directors review on page 48.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosures as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the decrease increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant.
The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a notable impact are noted here: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 m m US Dollar 1.5 0.8 Euro 2.4 0.5 Canadian Dollar 1.0 Financials Melrose Industries PLC 147 Annual Report 2014 Financials The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the increase decrease in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against Sterling.
The 2013 high sensitivity on Euro was due to a currency swap for 235 million that was put in place ahead of the 2013 year end to temporarily repay Euro debt with a proportion of the disposal proceeds in that year until the debt was redrawn ahead of the capital return on 28 February 2014.
Adjusting for the currency swap, the sensitivity on Euro at 31 December 2013 was 3.0 million.
The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a notable impact are noted here: 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 m m US Dollar 2.2 1.5 Euro 3.7 20.8 Canadian Dollar 0.4 0.4 In addition, the change in equity due to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation of net investment hedging instruments would be a decrease of 10.8 million 31 December 2013: 9.3 million and 12.7 million 31 December 2013: nil respectively.
However, there would be no overall effect on equity because there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swap contracts are measured using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.

Post Balance Sheet events At a General Meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015, shareholders approved a Return of Capital of 18.7 pence per Ordinary Share totalling 200.4 million.

On 20 February 2015 the number of Ordinary Shares in issue became 995,206,966 each with a nominal value of 7 55 pence.

Contingent liabilities As a result of acquisitions made by the Group, certain contingent legal, environmental, warranty and tax liabilities were identified either at the time of acquisition or as part of the completion of the acquisition accounting.
Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors best estimate has been included in the Balance Sheet where they existed at the time of acquisition and hence were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3: Business combinations.
Where a provision has been recognised, information regarding the different categories of such liabilities and the amount and timing of outflows is included within note 20.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on behalf of trading subsidiaries.
No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities.
The Group does not have any other significant contingent liabilities.
