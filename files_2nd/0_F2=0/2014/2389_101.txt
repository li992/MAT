Financial statements Operational and statistical information The following tables present operational and statistical information related to production, drilling, productive wells and acreage.
Figures include amounts attributable to assets held for sale.
Crude oil and natural gas production The following table shows crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production for the years ended 31 December 2014, 2013 and 2012. ab Production for the year Europe North South Africa Asia Australasia Total America America Rest of Rest of North Rest of c UK Europe US America Russia Asia Subsidiaries d Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2014 46 41 347 13 222 156 19 844 2013 58 31 305 17 217 141 21 789 2012 81 22 327 16 191 137 22 795 Natural gas liquids thousand barrels per day 2014 2 5 63 12 5 3 91 2013 3 4 58 12 3 1 4 86 2012 5 1 64 1 13 7 2 4 96 e Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2014 71 102 1,519 10 2,147 513 408 814 5,585 2013 157 80 1,539 11 2,221 561 490 784 5,845 2012 414 8 1,651 13 2,097 590 633 787 6,193 Equity-accounted entities BP share d Crude oil thousand barrels per day 2014 65 816 98 979 2013 62 826 232 1,120 2012 64 857 217 1,137 Natural gas liquids thousand barrels per day 2014 3 4 5 12 2013 3 5 11 19 2012 3 5 20 27 e Natural gas million cubic feet per day 2014 402 1,084 28 1,515 2013 384 801 30 1,216 2012 390 785 26 1,200 a Production excludes royalties due to others, whether payable in cash or in kind, where the royalty owner has a direct interest in the underlying production and the option and ability to make lifting and sales arrangements independently.
b Because of rounding, some totals may not exactly agree with the sum of their component parts.
c Amounts reported for Russia include BPs share of Rosneft 2014, 2013, and TNK-BP 2012 worldwide activities, including insignificant amounts outside Russia.
e Natural gas production excludes gas consumed in operations.
Productive oil and gas wells and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2014.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
c Includes approximately 3,239 gross 1,482 net multiple completion wells.
If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.
d Undeveloped acreage includes leases and concessions.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 195 Operational and statistical information continued Net oil and gas wells completed or abandoned The following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
Suspended development wells and long-term suspended exploratory wells are also included in the table.
