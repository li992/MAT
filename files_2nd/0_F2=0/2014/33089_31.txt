it is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of serps state earnings-related pension scheme.
the assets of the scheme are held in a trusteeadministered fund and kept separate from those of the company.
it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new Defined contribution scheme.
contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and are paid by the company.
in certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
the Group has three other small pension schemes.
the total net pension cost charged for the year was 6m 2012 13: 5m, of which 3m 2012 13: 3m relates to defined contribution plans.
a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 march 2012 by consulting actuaries, aon hewitt associates ltd. the employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 54.4% per annum of basic salaries.
the best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 march 2015 is 3m.
the major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 4.4 4.1 4.6 5.5 5.5 salary inflation 5.2 4.7 4.7 5.2 5.4 pensions increase 3.5 3.1 3.1 3.7 3.9 price inflation 3.7 3.2 3.2 3.7 3.9 the mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
the assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 29.7 years if they are male and for a further 30.9 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2034 at age 60 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 31.3 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.6 years after retirement if they are female.

the scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which, though are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
the allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure that it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
inflation risk the majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
the majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
life expectancy the majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
these levels are specified in accordance with iFrs 13 Fair value measurement.
on the following page of this note within the section valuation our property valuation approach and process is set out.
as noted in significant issues considered by the audit committee during the year on page 77, property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate.
For these reasons, and consistent with epras guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by iFrs 13. some of the inputs to the valuations are defined as unobservable by iFrs 13 and these are analysed in a table on the following page.
the Groups policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
there have been no transfers during the period.
the historical cost of properties was 5,574m 2012 13: 4,229m.
the property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2012 13: nil.
properties valued at 1,741m 2012 13: 1,724m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 1,066m 2012 13: 40m.
During the year to 31 march 2014, a gross amount of 286m of investment properties were reclassified to trading properties, as since planning consent has been granted it is the Groups intention to redevelop and sell these properties.
some of these trading properties were subsequently sold in the period.
included within the property valuation is 100m 2012 13: 91m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 5m 2012 13: 5m.
the balance arises through the iFrs treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
cumulative interest capitalised against investment properties amounts to 73m 2012 13: 56m.
The British Land Company PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 129 Financial statements and other inFormation n otes to the accoUnts c ontinUeD 11 property continued Valuation the Groups total property portfolio was valued by external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the rics valuation professional standards 2012, eighth edition, published by the royal institution of chartered surveyors.
the information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuations models used by the valuers are reviewed by the property portfolio team, the head of offices, the head of retail and the Finance Director.
the valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly to the audit committee at the interim and year-end review of results.
Further details of the audit committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the report of the audit committee page 78. investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the investment method of valuation.
this approach involves applying capitalisation yields to current and estimated future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and associated running costs.
these capitalisation yields and rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the market, using the valuers professional judgement and market observation.
other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
in the case of ongoing developments and properties held for development, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development including a notional finance cost, together with a further allowance for remaining risk.
properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.
copies of the valuation certificates of Knight Frank llp and cbre can be found on the website at: www.
a breakdown of valuations split between the Group and its share of joint ventures and funds is shown below: 2014 2013 Joint Joint ventures ventures Group and funds total Group and funds total m m m m m m Knight Frank llp 6,036 2,903 8,939 5,084 2,680 7,764 cbre 1,580 2,131 3,711 470 2,265 2,735 total property portfolio valuation 7,616 5,034 12,650 5,554 4,945 10,499 non-controlling interest share of property 422 188 610 total property portfolio valuation attributable to shareholders 7,194 4,846 12,040 5,554 4,945 10,499 infoRmation about faiR Value measuRements usinG unobseRVable inputs leVel 3 eRV per sq ft equivalent yield fair value at 31 march weighted weighted 2014 Valuation minimum maximum average minimum maximum average m technique % % % investment 1 UK retail 4,535 investment 2 60 20 4.1 16.8 5.9 methodolgy 2, 3 offices and residential 2,593 investment 4 80 46 1.3 10.1 5.1 methodolgy 3 developments 251 investment 17 93 37 4.3 6.0 5.4 methodolgy 1 includes the underlying properties within the investment held for trading, as disclosed in note 13, discounted for the date of the freehold reversions.
3 includes residential with an average capital value per sq ft of 877, including developments at end value and mixed-use.
all other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield or discount rate would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
however, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.

preF, a fund owning a portfolio of retail property in europe in which british land has a net investment of 54m, has its properties externally valued by cbre.
cbre have included a market uncertainty clause in the valuation report of the portuguese and spanish properties, due to the lack of transactional evidence and uncertainty over the economic situation in those markets.
in 2013 preF made partial early repayments of debt totalling 18m.
in march 2014, following the sale of its italian asset, 44m of debt was repaid.
preF now has 37m of bank loans that are due to mature in the calendar year 2015. in December 2013 a one-year extension of the fund to 26 march 2015 was approved.
Distributions in the year included the receipt of 6m from the broadgate joint venture, 2m from the meadowhall joint venture, 4m from the sainsburys joint venture, 17m from tesco joint ventures and 23m from hUt.

risks relating to capital structure are addressed within managing risk on pages 36 to 41. the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the financial policies on pages 56 to 58. inteRest Rate Risk manaGement the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
at 31 march 2014 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under ias 39, is a net liability of 45m 2012 13: liability of 80m.
the cross currency swap of the 2015 Us private placement, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure of the issuance, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
the market value of this is a liability of 5m 2012 13: asset of 5m.
the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 march 2014 was nil 2012 13: nil.
the cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.

at 31 march 2014 the weighted average interest rate of the sterling fixed rate debt was 5.17% 2012 13: 5.01%.
the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 8.5 years 2012 13: 11.6 years.
the weighted average interest rate for the euro fixed rate debt is 5.20% 2012 13: 4.44% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 1.9 years 2012 13: 3.1 years.
the floating rate debt is set for periods of the companys choosing at the relevant libor or similar rate.
the proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 69% at 31 march 2014. based on the Groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 56m 2012 13: 11m decrease.
similarly, a 52 bps reduction would increase profits by 5m 2012 13: 1m increase.
the change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month sterling libor over the last ten years.
the impact assumes libor does not fall below 0%.
Upward movements in medium and long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
the converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
the majority of the Groups interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under ias 39 therefore movements in their fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
a 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven-year sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
at 31 march 2014 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by 136m 2012 13: 117m.
a 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of the interest rate swap portfolio by 164m 2012 13: 138m.
because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
the 1.5% convertible bond is designated as fair value through profit or loss.
principal components of the market value include british lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
the fair value at 31 march 2014 was 458m.
at 31 march 2014 a 204 bps parallel upwards shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value by 30.8m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the value by 33.4m.

the currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
the Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with ias 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
the table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as will the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
based on the 31 march 2014 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the euro relative to sterling would result in a nil change 2012 13: nil in reported profits.

liquidity Risk manaGement the Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the financial policies on pages 56 to 58, and the risks addressed within managing risk on pages 36 to 41. the following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
the table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
the Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer-term, debt refinancings.

21 acquisition of a suBsidiary Business comBination on 17 February 2014, the Group acquired additional units of the hercules Unit trust, a Unit trust registered in Jersey which is engaged in property investment, resulting in a cumulative ownership of 57.2% of the outstanding units and control of the underlying entity.
management determined that the acquisition of control should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with iFrs 3 business combinations.
Following this transaction additional units were purchased bringing cumulative ownership to 58.6% at 31 march 2014. subsequent to 31 march 2014 further purchases resulted in a cumulative ownership of 59.8%.
