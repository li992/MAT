Retirement benefit liabilities The table below summarises the Groups net year end post-employment liabilities and activity for the year.
2014 2013 m m Balance sheet obligations for: Defined pension benefits 110.8 124.3 Post-employment medical benefits 15.9 11.5 126.7 135.8 Income statement charge included in profit before tax for: Defined pension benefits 17.5 16.3 Post-employment medical benefits 0.8 0.9 18.3 17.2 Remeasurements included in other comprehensive expense income for: Defined pension benefits 12.6 9.1 Post-employment medical benefits 3.1 2.7 15.7 6.4 Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, US and several other territories under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
The Groups main schemes are of the final salary pension type, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index, whereas in the US plans, pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
With the exception of this inflationary risk in the UK, the plans face broadly similar risks, as described on page 111.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the relevant Group company and the particular schemes board of trustees.
The board of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each schemes regulations.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of these schemes are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Present value of funded obligations UK pension scheme 811.6 725.5 US pension scheme 109.9 101.3 Rest of World 131.0 101.3 1,052.5 928.1 Fair value of schemes assets UK pension scheme 740.2 631.1 US pension scheme 95.8 83.2 Rest of World 110.5 94.0 946.5 808.3 Net liability in respect of funded schemes 106.0 119.8 Present value of unfunded obligations 4.8 4.5 Liability in Group balance sheet excluding post-employment medical benefits 110.8 124.3 108 Croda Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Statements Other Information 2014 2013 m m Movement in present value of retirement benefit obligations in the year: Opening balance 932.6 864.2 Current service cost 13.6 12.0 Settlements 9.7 Interest cost 39.2 36.4 Remeasurements Change in demographic assumptions 5.5 1.6 Change in financial assumptions 109.8 47.5 Experience gains losses 1.0 1.5 Contributions paid in Employee 2.7 2.8 Benefits paid 34.0 32.0 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 1.4 1.4 1,057.3 932.6 Movement in fair value of schemes assets in the year: Opening balance 808.3 712.3 Interest income 35.3 32.1 Remeasurements Return on scheme assets, excluding amounts included in financial expenses 101.5 41.5 Contributions paid in Employee 2.7 2.8 Employer 42.7 53.1 Benefits paid out including settlements 42.6 32.0 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 1.4 1.5 946.5 808.3 As at the balance sheet date, the present value of retirement benefit obligations was comprised of approximately 256m in respect of active employees, 301m in respect of deferred members and 500m in relation to members in retirement.
Total employer contributions to the schemes in 2015 are expected to be 32.5m.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 UK US UK US Discount rate 3.6% 4.0% 4.4% 4.5% Inflation rate 3.2% 2.5% 3.7% 2.5% Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.0% 4.7% 4.0% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0% n a 3.3% n a Duration of liabilities i. e. life expectancy years 20.1 12.0 19.4 10.9 Remaining working life 15.3 11.2 15.0 11.0 Croda Annual Report and Accounts 2014 109 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Accounts continued 11.
Retirement benefit liabilities continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions is as follows: Impact on retirement benefit obligation Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease Discount rate 0.5% -9.0% 10.4% Inflation rate 0.5% 6.4% -5.8% Mortality assume all scheme members one year younger 1 year 2.9% n a The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19.6 years.

The method of accounting, significant assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes set out above with the addition of actuarial assumptions relating to the long term increase in healthcare costs of 7.3% a year 2013: 7.5%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of this scheme are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Present value of unfunded obligations US scheme 15.9 11.5 2014 2013 m m Movement in present value of retirement benefit obligations in the year: Opening balance 11.5 13.9 Current service cost 0.3 0.4 Interest cost 0.5 0.5 Remeasurements Change in demographic assumptions 1.3 Change in financial assumptions 1.2 1.4 Experience losses gains 0.7 1.3 Benefits paid 0.5 0.5 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 0.9 0.1 15.9 11.5 110 Croda Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Statements Other Information Pension and medical benefits risks and volatility Through its defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, a deficit will be created.
Both the UK and US plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Whilst our Dutch scheme is less mature, regulatory pressures result inlower equity holdings.
As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group and the Trustees believe that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently.
See below for more details on the Groups asset-liability matching strategy.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, the level of inflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase thedeficit.
In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity tochanges in life expectancy.
In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching ALM framework that has been developed to achieve long term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes.
Within this framework, the Groups ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations.
The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Alarge portion of assets in 2014 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and Infrastructure funds.
The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
Both the UK and Dutch schemes make use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.
The triennial valuation of the UK scheme was completed as at 30 September 2014 but has not yet been finalised.
The results are expected to show that the actuarial scheme deficit has been eliminated with the latest deficit payment of 22m in January 2015.
As a result, it is expected that deficit funding payments to this scheme will not be required over the coming three years.
The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually.
As at 31 December 2013 the scheme was 107.3% funded, with the funding level allowing for contributions received during 2014.
The Groups Dutch scheme, as alluded to earlier, is subject to a more rigorous regulatory environment under the supervision of the Dutch National Bank DNB.
As at 31 December 2014 the scheme was 118.0% funded on an actuarial basis relative to the DNBs required level of 114.4% and a minimum funding requirement of 105.4%.
