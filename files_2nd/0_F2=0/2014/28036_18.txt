FINANCIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Principal Accounting Policies Accounting policies describe the Companys approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied during the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of Preparation Accounting Standards applied The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain fixed assets, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
The financial statements are also prepared on a going concern basis.
The disclosures on going concern in the Directors Report on page 20 form part of the financial statements.
b Foreign Currency and Segmental Reporting i Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well as its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue account, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
iii Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business of investing in equity and debt securities, issued by companies quoted mainly on the UK or other regulated stock exchanges.
c Financial Instruments i Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.
ii Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.
iii Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
iv Trade date accounting Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
42 FINANCIAL v Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Companys investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date.
For investments that are not actively traded or where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available, fair value is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling.
Where there is no active market, unlisted illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value based on recommendations from Invescos Pricing Committee, which in turn is guided by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Guidelines, using valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent arms length transactions and net assets.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Hedging and Derivatives Forward currency contracts entered into for hedging purposes are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.
Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and any profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Derivative instruments may be capital or revenue in nature and, accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognised in revenue or capital in the income statement as appropriate.
e Income Dividend income arises from equity investments held and is recognised on the date investments are marked ex-dividend.
Deposit interest and underwriting commission receivable are taken into account on an accruals basis.
Interest income arising from fixed income securities and cash is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
f Expenses and Finance Costs Expenses are recognised on an accruals basis and finance costs are recognised using the effective interest method in the income statement.
The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue.
This is in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the portfolio.
The performance fee is allocated wholly to capital as it arises from capital returns on the portfolio.
Investment transaction costs are recognised in capital in the income statement.
All other expenses are allocated to revenue in the income statement.
PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 43 FINANCIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued g Taxation The liability for corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year excluding dividends.
The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses, losses on loan relationships and eligible unrelieved foreign tax, as the Company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
h Dividends Dividends are not recognised in the financial statements unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Proposed dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.

Taxation As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
The Company also suffers no tax on income arising on UK and certain overseas dividends, mainly EU ones.
As a result, the Companys tax charge arises solely from irrecoverable tax on overseas dividends.
Lastly, this note clarifies the basis for the Company having no deferred tax asset or liability.

Return per Ordinary Share Return per share is the amount of gain generated for the financial year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
2014 2013 000 000 Returns after tax: revenue 31,652 27,604 capital 113,711 146,425 total 145,363 174,029 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year: basic 227,407,467 216,743,446 diluted potential shares arising from subscription shares 2,040,967 3,316,449 total 229,448,434 220,059,895 46 FINANCIAL The diluted return per ordinary share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, as adjusted in accordance with the requirements of FRS22 Earnings per Share.
In calculating the diluted return, the exercise of all the subscription shares has been assumed, with the exercise proceeds of 218.94p per share being used to purchase ordinary shares at a price of 344.83p, being the average market price up to the subscription share exercise date.
For the year ended 31 March 2013, the subscription shares were dilutive as the average market price for the year of 282.29p was greater than the exercise price.
Dividends on Ordinary Shares Dividends represent the return of income less expenses to shareholders.
The Company pays four interim dividends a year.
A fourth interim dividend of 3.7p per share and special dividend of 1.9p per share were declared on 28 May 2014, for payment on 27 June 2014 to shareholders on the register on 6 June 2014.
Investments at Fair Value The portfolio comprises investments which are listed, i. e. traded on a regulated stock exchange, and a small proportion of investments which are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.
Gains and losses in the year are either: realised, usually arising when investments are sold: or unrealised, being the difference from cost on those investments still held at the year end.

Debtors Debtors are amounts which are due to the Company, such as monies due from brokers for investments sold and income which has been earned accrued but not yet received.
Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Creditors are amounts which must be paid by the Company and are split between those due within 12 months of the balance sheet date and those due after that time.
The main creditors are the bank overdraft and, for this year only, the debenture as the latter matures within 3 months of the balance sheet date.

The debenture has a fixed rate of 6.125% per annum.
Interest is payable on 8 January and 8 July.
The debenture trust deed requires total borrowings to not exceed 25% of Adjusted Capital and Reserves.
Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year These creditors are amounts due, as shown by note 11, but are due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium arises on the issue of new shares and is non-distributable.
The capital reserve includes the investment holding gains losses, being the difference between cost and market value at the balance sheet date, totalling a gain of 261,467,000 2013: 204,617,000.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable.
Net Asset Value The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into net asset value per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.

PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 51 FINANCIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 19.
Financial Instruments Financial instruments comprise the Companys investment portfolio, derivative financial instruments if the Company had any, as well as any cash, borrowings, other receivables and other payables.
The Companys strategy for managing investment risk is determined with regard to the Companys Investment Policy, as outlined in the Business Review on page 9.
The management of market risk is part of the investment management process.
The Companys portfolio is managed in accordance with the internal controls and risk management systems as described in the sections thereon in the Corporate Governance Statement page 25 and in the Audit Committee Report page 29.
The overall disposition of the Companys assets is reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
The Companys financial instruments comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 14 and 15 cash, borrowings including overdraft and debenture, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities of the Company as more fully described in the Business Review.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to meet its investment objective and policies.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The risks applicable to the Company and the policies the Company used to manage these risks for the two years under review follow.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys direct exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed on page 23.
No other derivative or hedging instruments are utilised to manage market risk.
Gearing is used to enhance returns, but this also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish krona.
52 FINANCIAL Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objective and policies.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset denominated in those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
31 MARCH 2014 31 MARCH 2013 US SWISS US SWISS SWEDISH DOLLAR FRANC DOLLAR FRANC KRONA 000 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 401 986 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 56,229 69,523 41,118 77,331 1,138 Total net foreign currency exposure 56,630 70,509 41,118 77,331 1,138 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year using exchange rates for sterling to US dollars, Swiss francs and Swedish krona.
It is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
The exchange rate of 3.4% 2013: 2.1% for US dollars, 1.3% 2013:2.2% for Swiss francs and 2.9% 2013: 3.9% for Swedish krona has been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable foreign currency against the mean.
If sterling had strengthened, this would have had the following effect: 31 MARCH 2014 31 MARCH 2013 US SWISS US SWISS SWEDISH DOLLAR FRANC DOLLAR FRANC KRONA 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit loss after taxation Revenue return 58 39 36 49 Capital return 1,925 917 866 1,675 45 Total loss after taxation for the year 1,983 956 902 1,724 45 If sterling had weakened against the currencies above, the effect would have been the exact opposite.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure may change frequently as part of the currency risk management process of the Company.
PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 53 FINANCIAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 19.
Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures continued Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate of the Custodian.
At the year end the Company had an uncommitted bank overdraft facility based on the lower of 25% of the net assets of the Company and 130 million.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The Company also has in issue a 30 million 6.125% Debenture 2014.
At the year end drawings on the Companys overdraft were 97,693,000 2013: 74,383,000 and the debenture had an amortised cost of 29,982,000 2013: 29,915,000.
At the maximum overdraft of 130 million, the effect of a 1% in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Companys income statement of 1.3 million.
At the year end the Company had no exposure to any debt securities.
In 2013 the Company had a 2,100,000 exposure arising from one fixed rate debt security of less than one year maturity.
This was a fixed rate security and so the Company had no exposure to floating interest rate risk.
Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return for an acceptable level of risk.
Management of other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and as a result is not correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio rose or fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year would increase or decrease by 102.7 million 2013: 84.7 million respectively.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments are readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the 130 million bank overdraft facility provides for additional funding flexibility, and this facility was unchanged at the year end.
Since the year end, the overdraft facility was reduced to 110 million.

Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and overdraft.
The fair value of the 30 million 6.125% Debenture 2014, based on the offer value at the balance sheet date, is 30,600,000 2013: 31,950,000.
Fair Value of Hierarchy Disclosures Nearly all of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The three levels set out in FRS29 follow.
Level 1 fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 fair values based on valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 fair values based on valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
All bar one of the quoted equity investments are deemed to be Level 1.
Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes is the sole Level 2 holding.
Level 3 investments at the year end comprise solely of unquoted securities.
