The principal area of operation for each of the above subsidiaries is the United Kingdom.
A full list of subsidiaries will be included in the Companys next annual return, the Company having made use of the exemption in section 410 of the Companies Act 2006.
In November 2009, as part of the restructuring plan that was a requirement for European Commission approval of state aid received by the Group, Lloyds Banking Group agreed to suspend the payment of coupons and dividends on certain of the Groups preference shares and preferred securities for the two year period from 31 January 2010 to 31 January 2012.
The Group also agreed to temporarily suspend and or waive dividend payments on certain preference shares which have been issued intra group.
Consequently, in accordance with the terms of some of these instruments, subsidiaries could have been prevented from making dividend payments on ordinary shares during this period.
In addition, certain subsidiary companies currently have insufficient distributable reserves to make dividend payments.
Subject to the foregoing, there were no further significant restrictions on any of the Companys subsidiaries in paying dividends or repaying loans and advances.
All regulated banking and insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain capital at levels agreed with the regulators: this may impact those subsidiaries ability to make distributions.
