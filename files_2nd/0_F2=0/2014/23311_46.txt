The Directors will not dilute the interests of existing shareholders by using the authority to issue shares at a price which is less than the Net Asset Value calculated with debt at market value of the existing shares in issue at that time.
These authorities will expire at the next AGM of the Company or fifteen months after the passing of the resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
Special Resolution 16: Authority to Buy Back Shares This resolution seeks to renew the Directors authority to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital, this being 29,247,998 ordinary shares as at 27 May 2014.
The authority will expire at the Companys next AGM or 15 months following the passing of this resolution, if earlier.
The principal purpose of share buy backs is to enhance the net asset value for remaining shareholders and purchases will only be made if they enhance the net asset value for the remaining shareholders.
In accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority UK Listing Rules, the maximum price which can be paid is 5% above the average of the middle market values of the ordinary shares for the five business days before the purchase is made.
The minimum price which may be paid will be 25p per share, this being the nominal value of a share.
In making purchases, the Company will deal only with member firms of the London Stock Exchange.
The Company will finance the purchase of ordinary shares by using its existing cash balance or by selling securities in the Companys portfolio.
The Directors might consider holding repurchased shares as treasury shares with a view to possible resale.
Special Resolution 17: Notice Period for General Meetings The EU Shareholder Rights Directive increased the notice period for general meetings of companies to 21 days unless certain conditions are met in which case it may be 14 days notice.
A shareholders resolution is required to ensure that the Companys general meetings other than Annual General Meetings may be held on 14 days notice.
Accordingly, Special Resolution 17 will propose that the period of notice for general meetings of the Company other than AGMs shall not be less than 14 days notice.
The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of AGM and, in their opinion, consider them all to be in the best interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution.
