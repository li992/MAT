Purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers In March 2013 BP began a share repurchase, or buyback, programme the buyback programme with an expected total value of up to $8 billion.
The decision to buy back shares followed the completion of the sale of BPs 50% interest in TNK-BP to Rosneft.
The programme expected to return to BP shareholders an amount equivalent to the value of BPs original investment in TNK-BP and to exceed that required to offset the earnings per share dilution expected as a result of the sale of TNK-BP.
It also reflected the reduction in BPs asset base following its $38-billion divestment programme.
The buyback programme was completed in July 2014.
A further $2.3 billion of share repurchases were carried out in 2014 after the completion of the previously announced programme, funded by BPs continuing divestment of assets as announced in October 2013, and under the authority granted by shareholders at the 2014 AGM for BP to repurchase up to 1.8 billion ordinary shares.
