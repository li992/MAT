Report of the Directors After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of this annual financial report.
Whilst it is not currently anticipated that continuation votes will need to be put to any class of shareholders of the Company in the next twelve months, the Board cannot be certain that the requirement for one or more continuation votes will not be triggered and, if continuation votes were triggered, it cannot be confirmed that any or all of such continuation votes would be passed.
Notwithstanding such uncertainty, the financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis in light of the Boards assessment of: shareholders appetite to continue their investments in the Company: and the expectation of the Directors that the Company will continue for the foreseeable future.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys Auditors are unaware: and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys Auditors are aware of that information.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each Financial Year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the Financial Year and of the profit or loss for that year.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: Ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for a shareholder to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy: Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently: Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures discussed and explained in the Annual Report and Accounts: and Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
