In the year there was also a 0.1m loss on disposal arising from the sale of Ascot College in 2013.

Exceptional Items continued Other Exceptional Operating Items 2014 2013 Year ended 31 December m m Costs associated with UK Government reviews 9.2 11.6 Settlement amounts relating to UK Government reviews 66.3 UK frontline clinical health contract provisions 16.1 17.6 Restructuring costs 32.7 14.9 Provision for settlement relating to DLR pension deficit funding dispute 35.6 Other provision for legal claims 20.1 Impairment and related charges of Australian rail business 37.2 9.6 Impairment of Global Services business transferred to assets held for sale 39.2 Impairment of goodwill 466.0 Deferred consideration relating to prior year acquisition 10.3 Other exceptional operating items 656.1 109.7 Costs Associated with UK Government Reviews During the prior year, an investigation was undertaken by the Ministry of Justice into the billing practices in respect of the Electronic Monitoring EM contract.
Additionally, the Cabinet Office undertook a wider review across other Serco contracts with UK Central Government.
Serco also agreed with the UK Government to undertake a process of corporate renewal, to strengthen governance and transparency.
During the year, there were exceptional costs totalling 9.2m 2013: 11.6m associated with the UK Government reviews and the programme of corporate renewal.
This reflected external costs incurred and included external adviser costs related to these reviews.
Settlement Amounts Relating to UK Government Reviews In December 2013, following a review of the billing arrangements on the EM contract by the Ministry of Justice, a settlement of 64.3m was reached in respect of contractual claims.
In addition, a 2.0m settlement was reached on the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services PECS contract which was also subject to Government review to reflect repayment of past profit earned on this contract.
The settlement was full and final in respect of contractual claims with the proviso that additional payments might be sought in limited circumstances, such as if criminality were to be established: Serco continues to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations by the Serious Fraud Office.
UK Frontline Clinical Health Contract Provisions During 2014, there were additional exceptional provisions of 16.1m 2013: 17.6m, including an onerous contract provision of 13.7m to cover the anticipated future year loss from the unexpected increase in patient volumes in 2014 on the Suffolk Community Health contract.
The provisions relate to the re-evaluation of the forecast losses of the UK clinical health operations, against which an exceptional onerous contract provision of 17.6m was made in the prior year and reflect the Groups withdrawal from the front-line UK clinical health market, with the future focus of the Group on Healthcare being on the provision of non-frontline health services.
This re-evaluation reflected reviews showing there are additional costs of delivering improved service levels and meeting performance obligations through to the end of the contracts.
The Cornwall out-of-hours contract is being exited early in May 2015 and Braintree Clinical Services was disposed of in March 2014.
The third loss-making contract, Suffolk Community Health, is being run through to the end of the contract term in September 2015.
Restructuring Costs As a result of analysis of the cost structures in the businesses and initial actions from the Strategy Review, an exceptional restructuring charge of 32.7m was taken in the year reflecting 19.8m in relation to headcount reductions, 6.9m in relation to property-related exit costs and related asset impairments and 6.0m of adviser costs associated with the Strategy Review and the Contract and Balance Sheet Review.
These have been treated as exceptional costs as they have arisen directly as a result of restructuring in response to the impact of the UK Government reviews and the Strategy Review.
Provision for Settlement Relating to DLR Pension Deficit Funding Dispute In November 2014 the Group agreed to settle a dispute with the Trustees of the Docklands Light Railway DLR Pension Scheme over the extent of its liability to fund the deficit on the scheme.
This had previously been included as a contingent liability in 2013 based on legal advice taken at the time.
The settlement has resulted in a total exceptional charge inclusive of costs of 35.6m, consisting of the full and final settlement amount of 33.0m and costs of 2.6m.
The settlement is to be paid over four equal annual instalments from January 2015 to January 2018 covering all past and any future DLR associated pension liabilities.
Other Provision for Legal Claims An exceptional provision of 20.1m has been recognised for legal claims made against Serco for commercial disputes.
This provision is based on legal advice received by the Company.
Impairment and Related Charges of Australian Rail Business In 2014 the Group put the business up for sale and this is expected to complete in the first half of 2015.
An impairment review was performed on the Australian rail business, Great Southern Rail, resulting in a charge totalling 37.2m 2013: 9.6m.
This consisted of an impairment of 23.1m to reduce the carrying value of its net assets to the estimated recoverable amount and a charge of 14.1m in relation to the break costs of leases relating to the business.
