CSR in review Strategic report Governance Other information Financial statements Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to the same taxation authority and net settlement and offset is permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 $000 $000 Deferred tax assets 129,296 109,181 Deferred tax liabilities 3,910 4,948 125,386 104,233 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $858,804,327 2013: $716,703,068 and unused tax credits of $39,517,828 2013: $38,192,791 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining unused tax losses of $582,246,258 2013: $498,808,643 and unused tax credits of $27,600,726 2013: $26,728,251 due to either a history of tax losses, uncertain tax positions, or it is not considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to realise the benefit of all deferred tax assets within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses and unrecognised tax credits are tax losses of $257,735,277 2013: $212,129,934 and tax credits of $27,600,276 2013: $26,728,251 that will expire in 5-19 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences of $30,311,672 2013: $28,289,628 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 26 December 2014 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset is based on managements assessment of historic profitability, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans and a review of the tax planning opportunities.
Based on this, management concluded that there is convincing evidence for the recognition of deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liability by $106,336,381 2013: $88,250,962 in entities that have suffered a loss in the current or preceding periods.
12 Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing profit loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue throughout the period, adjusting for ordinary shares held in Treasury and ordinary shares held by the Employee benefit Trust.
For diluted earnings loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is further adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive ordinary shares, arising from the assumed exercise of employee share options and share awards that are in the money and for which management has identied that performance conditions, associated with the vesting of certain employee share options and awards, is likely to be achieved.
For a description of the Groups employee share option and share award plans, refer to note 29.
Earnings loss per share is only diluted when the result for the period is a profit.
