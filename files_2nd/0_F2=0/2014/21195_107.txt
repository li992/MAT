a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts gross of reinsurance at 31 December comprised: 2014 2013 Long-term business m m Participating contracts 67,232 70,628 Non-participating contracts at fair value 50,013 48,140 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 50,013 48,140 Total 117,245 118,768 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 2,710 117,245 116,058 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 41.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 43.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Following the disposal of US Life we currently have no nonparticipating investment contracts measured at amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 49,737 million in 2014 are unit linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves, if required, on a fair value basis.
These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number of units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 29 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 52.
For non-participating investment contracts, deposits collected and amounts withdrawn are not shown on the income statement, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the gross liabilities for investment contracts.
The associated change in investment contract provisions shown on the income statement consists of the attributed investment return.
Participating investment contracts are treated consistently with insurance contracts with the change in investment contract provisions primarily consisting of the movement in participating investment contract liabilities net of reinsurance over the reporting period.
