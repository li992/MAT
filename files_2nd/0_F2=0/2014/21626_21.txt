Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company are set out below.
a Basis of preparation The Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
These comprise standards and interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standard Interpretations Committee as approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
All of the Groups operations are of a continuing nature.
Insofar as the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, revised in January 2009, is compatible with IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the guidance set out in the SORP.
The AIC SORP was revised and reissued in November 2014 effective 1 January 2015 and where compatible with IFRS will be applied to financial statements in subsequent reporting periods.
The Groups financial statements are presented in sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2014 that have been adopted by the Group in preparing these financial statements are: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements Investment Entities amendments effective 1 January 2014 establish a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities.
The changes introduced by the Investment Entities amendments require management to exercise signi cant judgement to determine which entities are controlled and therefore are required to be consolidated by a parent.
The Directors, having assessed the criteria, believe the Parent Company meets the criteria to be an investment entity under IFRS 10 and that this accounting treatment re ects the Companys activities as an investment trust.
Therefore any investments in subsidiaries may be carried at fair value through pro t and loss in accordance IAS39.
However, the principal activity of the subsidiary, BlackRock World Mining Investment Company Limited which is controlled by the Company, is investment dealing activities and therefore this entity is considered to provide investment related services to the Company and is required to be consolidated under the Investment Entities amendment.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities JCEs using proportionate consolidation.
The Group does not have any joint arrangements and therefore the provisions of these amendments did not have anyimpact on the Group.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities requires additional disclosures that relate to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The amendments to IFRS 12 introduce new disclosure requirements related to interests in subsidiaries which have been set out in note 11: however, these amendments have not had any impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Group.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after1 January 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a signi cant effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised in the financial statements of the Group and Parent Company.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 2014 replaces IAS 39 and deals with a package of improvements including principally a revised model for classi cation and measurement of financial instruments, a forward looking expected loss impairment model and a revised framework for hedge accounting.
In terms of classi cation and measurement, the revised standard is principles based depending on the business model and nature of cash ows.
Under this approach, instruments are measured at either amortised cost or fair value, though the standard retains the fair value option allowing designation of debt instruments at initial recognition to be measured at fair value.
[46] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC The standard is effective from 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted but has not yet been endorsed by the European Commission.
The Group does not plan to early adopt this standard and expects the eventual impact to be insigni cant for its current investment portfolio, which is substantially comprised of quoted investments.
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts effective 1 January 2016 allows first time IFRS adopters to continue to account for regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with previous GAAP.
As the Company has already adopted IFRS, the provisions of this standard are not applicable.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2017 speci es how and when an entity should recognise revenue and enhances the nature of revenue disclosures.
Given the nature of the Companys revenue streams from financial instruments, the provisions of this standard are not expected to be applicable.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements are made up to 31 December each year and incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackRock World Mining Investment Company Limited.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Company obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised pro ts arising therefrom, are eliminated.
c Presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to re ect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and a capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
d Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business being investment business.
e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends, if any, are treated as a capital or a revenue receipt depending on the facts or circumstances of each particular case.
The return on a debt security is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to re ect the effective yield on the debt security.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Royalty income from contractual rights is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable where the Investment Manager can reliably estimate the amount, pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
Royalty income from contractual rights received comprise of a return of income and a return of capital based on the underlying cost of the contract and, accordingly, the return of income element is taken to the revenue account and the return of capital element is taken to the capital account.
These amounts are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income within income from investments and gains losses on investments held at fair value through pro t or loss, respectively.
The useful life of the contractual rights will be determined by reference to the contractual arrangements, the planned mine life on commencement of mining and the underlying cost of the contractual rights will be revalued on a systematic basis using the units of production method over the life of the contractual rights which is estimated using available estimated proved and probable reserves speci cally associated with the mine.
The Investment Manager relies on public disclosures for information onproven and probable reserves from the operators of the mine.
Amortisation rates are adjusted on a prospective basis for all changes to estimates of the life of contractual rights and iron ore reserves.
These are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement ofComprehensive Income within gains losses on investments held at fair value through pro t or loss.
Option premium income is recognised as revenue evenly over the life of the option contract and included in the revenue column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income unless the option has been written for the maintenance and enhancement of the Companys investment portfolio and represents an incidental part of a larger capital transaction, in whichcase any premium arising are allocated to the capital column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When an option is closed out or exercised the gain or loss is accounted for as capital.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued f Expenses All expenses, including finance costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses have been charged wholly to the revenue column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except as follows: X expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are charged to the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Details of transaction costs on the purchases and sales of investments are disclosed in note 10 onpage 54: X the investment management fee and finance costs have been allocated 75% to the capital column and 25% to the revenue column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in line with the Boards expected long term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, respectively, from the investment portfolio: X expenses are treated as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
g Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the financial reporting date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more taxation in the future or right to pay less taxation in the future have occurred at the financial reporting date.
This is subject to deferred taxation assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable pro ts from which the future reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are measured at the rates applicable to the legaljurisdictions in which they arise.
h Investments held at fair value through pro t or loss The Companys investments, including contractual rights, are classi ed as held at fair value through pro t or loss in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with its investment strategy.
All investments, including contractual rights, are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through pro t or loss.
Purchases of investments are recognised on a trade date basis.
Ths sales of assets are recognised at the trade date of the disposal.
Proceeds are measured at fair value, which is regarded as the proceeds of sale less any transaction costs.
Contractual rights are recognised on the completion date, where a purchase of the rights is under a contract and is initially measured at fair value excluding transaction costs.
The fair value of the financial investments is based on their quoted bid price at the financial reporting date, without deduction for the estimated selling costs.
For all financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques deemed by the Board to be appropriate in the circumstances.
Valuation techniques include the market approach i. e. using recent arms length market transactions adjusted as necessary and reference to the current market value ofanother instrument that is substantially the same and the income approach i. e. discounted cash ow analysis and option pricing models making as much use of available and supportable market data as possible.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of investments and on disposal of investments are recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The gains and losses from changes in fair value of contractual rights are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and arise as a result of the revaluation of the underlying cost ofthe contractual rights, changes in commodity prices and changes in estimates of proven and probable reserves speci cally associated with the mine.
Under IFRS, the investment in the subsidiary is fair valued which is deemed to be the net asset value of the subsidiary.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through pro t or loss and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through pro t or loss.
Also included within this heading are transaction costs in relation to the purchase or sale of investments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statements of Financial Position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
[48] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC i Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables do not carry any interest and are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value.
j Dividends payable Under IFRS, final dividends should not be accrued in the financial statements unless they have been approved by shareholders before the financial reporting date.
Interim dividends should not be accrued in the financial statements unless they have been paid.
Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised in the Statements of Changes in Equity when they have been approved by shareholders in the case of a final dividend, or paid in the case of an interim dividend, and have become a liability of the Group.
k Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the financial reporting date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a revenue or capital item depending on the income or expense to which they relate.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and on demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
m Bank borrowings Bank overdrafts and loans are recorded as the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including any premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
n Derivatives Derivatives are held at fair value based on the bid offer prices of the options written to which the Group is exposed.
The value of the option is subsequently marked to market to re ect the fair value of the option based on traded prices.
Where the premium is taken to revenue, an appropriate amount is shown as capital return such that the total return re ects the overall change in the fair value of the option.
When an option is closed out or exercised the gain or loss is accounted for as a capital gain or loss.
o Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by fide nition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
Fair value of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Statements of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, their fair value is determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of valuation models.
The fair value of contractual rights is assessed by an independent valuer with a recognised and relevant professional quali cation.
The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is notfeasible, estimation is required in establishing fair values.
The estimates include considerations of production pro les, commodity prices, cash ows and discount rates.
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments in the Statements of Financial Position and the level where the instruments are disclosed in the fair value hierarchy.
To assess the signi cance of a particular input to the entire measurement, the external valuer performs sensitivity analysis.
The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the contractual rights and sensitivity analyses are provided in note 18.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS LIABILITIES Group and Group and Company Company 2014 2013 000 000 Deferred tax asset in respect of timing differences At 1 January 1,795 3,002 Deferred tax asset recognised in respect of timing differences Utilisation of deferred tax asset 1,346 1,207 At 31 December 449 1,795 Deferred tax liabilities in respect of timing differences At 1 January 277 991 Movement in Peruvian capital gains tax liability 266 714 At 31 December 11 277 Comprised of: Deferred tax assets 449 1,795 Deferred tax liabilities 11 277 438 1,518 At 31 December 2014, the Company had net excess management expenses of 2.2 million 2013: 9.4 million.
A deferred tax asset of 0.4 million 2013: 1.8 million has been recognised at the tax rate of 20% in respect of these management expenses adjusted for accrued income as the Company is expected to generate taxable income in the future in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is likely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing excess expenses.
Following the changes in Peruvian tax legislation effective from 1 January 2011, a capital gains tax is imposed on gains realised by non-residents at rates of 5% or 30% depending on whether the transaction took place inside or outside of Peru.
The Group hasaccrued a capital gains tax liability of 11,000 2013: 277,000 for unrealised capital gains arising on investments in stocks listed on the Peruvian stock exchange.
The tax has been calculated at the rate of 5% of the unrealised capital gains, being the difference between the market value of the investments at the year end and their average purchase cost.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The Groups investment activities expose it to various types of risks which are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
The following information is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of all risks and shareholders should refer to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive Fund 3.2.
2R Disclosures which can be found at blackrock.
co. uk brwm for a more detailed discussion of the risks inherent in investing in the Company.
The following information refers to the risk management framework of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager AIFM : however, as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 31 and in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities on page 36, itis the ultimate responsibility of the Board to ensure that the Groups risks are appropriately monitored, and to the extent that elements of this are delegated to third party service providers, the Board is responsible for ensuring that the relevant parties are discharging their duties in accordance with the terms of relevant agreements.
The AIFM reports to the Board at each meeting on key risk metrics and risk management processes: in addition, the Depositary monitors the performance of the AIFM and reports to the Audit & Management Engagement Committee at each meeting.
Any issues are reported to the Board on an ad hoc basis as they arise.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 DECEMBER 2014 [57] Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued Risk management framework The Directors of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager AIFM review quarterly investment performance reports and receive semi-annual presentations in person from the Investment Manager covering the Groups performance and risk pro le during theyear.
The AIFM has delegated the day-to-day administration of the investment programme to the Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager is also responsible for ensuring that the Group is managed within the terms of its investment guidelines and limits set out in the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive Fund 3.2.
The AIFM is responsible for the investment performance, product risk monitoring and oversight and has the responsibility for the monitoring and oversight of regulatory and operational risk for the Group.
The Directors of the AIFM haveappointed a Risk Manager who has responsibility for the daily risk management process with assistance from key risk management personnel of the Investment Manager, including members of the Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group RQA whichis a centralised group within BlackRock which performs an independent risk management function.
RQA independently identi es, measures and monitors investment risk and monitors the risk management practices being deployed across the Group.
RQA has the ability to determine if the appropriate risk management processes are in place across the Group including the risk management tools employed, how the levels of risk are controlled, ensuring risk return is considered in portfolio construction and reviewing outcomes.
The risk exposures of the Group are set out as follows: a Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments in uenced by other price, currency and interest rate movements.
It represents the potential loss the Group may suffer through holding market positions in financial instruments in the face of market movements.
Value at Risk VaR is a statistical risk measure that estimates the potential portfolio loss from adverse market moves in anordinary market environment.
VaR analysis re ects the interdependencies between risk variables, unlike a traditional sensitivity analysis.
The VaR calculations are based on a con dence level of 99%, with a holding period of not greater than one month 20 days and ahistorical observation period of not less than one year 250 days.
A VaR number is fide ned at a speci ed probability and a speci ed time horizon.
A 99% one month VaR means that the expectation is that 99% of the time over a one month period the Group will lose lessthan this number in percentage terms.
Therefore, higher VaR numbers indicate higher risk.
It is noted that the use of VaR methodology has limitations, namely assumptions that risk factor returns are normally distributed and that the use of historical market data as a basis for estimating future events does not encompass all possible scenarios, particularly those that are of an extreme nature and that the use of a speci ed con dence level e. g. 99% does not take into account losses that occur beyond this level.
There is some probability that the loss could be greater than the VaR amounts.
These limitations and the nature of the VaR measure mean that the Group can neither guarantee that losses will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated, nor that losses in excess of the VaR amounts will not occur more frequently.
The one month VaR as of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 based on a 99% con dence level was 15.06% and 15.87%, respectively.
i Market risk arising from other price risk Exposure to other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, whether those changes are caused by factors speci c to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Group is exposed to market price risk arising from its equity investments.
The movements in the prices of these investments result in movements in the performance of the Group.
Management of other price risk By diversifying the portfolio, where this is appropriate and consistent with the Groups objectives, the risk that a price change of aparticular investment will have a material impact on the NAV of the Group is managed in line with the investment objectives of the Group.
[58] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on pages 17 to 19.
At 31 December 2014, this shows that the portfolio had signi cant levels of investments in Africa, Latin America, Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
ii Market risk arising from foreign currency risk Exposure to foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign currency sensitivity risk for the investment portfolio has been covered by the VaR analysis under the market risksection.
The fair values of the Groups monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 are shown below.
Where the Groups equity investments, which are not monetary items, are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

The Investment Manager measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groupsnet asset value and income of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Group does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against exposure to foreign currency risk.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued Consequently, the Group is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its reporting currencies relative to other currencies may change in a manner which has an adverse effect on the value of the portion of the Groups assets which are denominated in currencies other than their own currencies.
iii Market risk arising from interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk speci cally through its cash holdings and its borrowing facility for investment purposes.
Interest rate sensitivity risk has been covered by the VaR analysis under the market risk section.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: X oating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set: X xed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

Management of interest rate risk The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowings under the loan and overdraft facilities.
The Group nances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board of the Company.
TheGroup, generally, does not hold signi cant balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
b Counterparty credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the issuer of a financial instrument will fail to ful l an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk from the parties with which it trades and will bear the risk of settlement default.
Counterparty credit risk to the Group arises from transactions to purchase or sell investments, commodity futures and through option writing transactions on equity investments held within the portfolio.
Credit Risk is monitored and managed by BlackRocks RQA Counterparty and Concentration Risk team.
The team is headed by BlackRocks Chief Credit Of cer who reports to the Global Head of RQA.
Credit authority resides with the Chief Credit Of cer and selected team members to whom speci c credit authority has been delegated.
As such, counterparty approvals may be granted by the Chief Credit Of cer, or by identi ed RQA Credit Risk Of cers who have been formally delegated authority by the Chief Credit Of cer.
[60] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC The BlackRock RQA Counterparty and Concentration Risk team completes a formal review of each new counterparty, monitors and reviews all approved counterparties on an ongoing basis and maintains an active oversight of counterparty exposures and the collateral management process.
Depositary With effect from 2 July 2014, the Groups Depositary is BNY Mellon Trust & Depositary UK Limited the Depositary S&Ps long term credit rating as at 31 December 2014: A.
All of the equity and debt investments and cash of the Group are held within the custodial network of the Depositary.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Depositary may cause the Companys rights with respect to its investments held by the Depositary to be delayed or limited.
The maximum exposure to this risk at 31 December 2014 is the total value of equity investments held with the Depositary and cash and cash equivalents in the Statements of Financial Position.
In accordance with the requirements of the depositary agreement, the Depositary will ensure that any agents it appoints to assist in safekeeping the equity and debt investments of the Group will segregate the equity and debt investments of the Group.
Thus, in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Depositary, the Groups equity and debt investments are segregated and this reduces counterparty credit risk.
The Group will, however, be exposed to the counterparty credit risk of the Depositary in relation to the Groups cash held by the Depositary.
In the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Depositary, the Group will be treated as a general creditor of the Depositary in relation to cash holdings of the Group.
Counterparties Brokers All transactions in listed securities are settledpaid for upon delivery using an approved broker.
The risk of default is considered minimal, as delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has made payment.
Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been delivered by the broker.
The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligation.
Counterparty credit risk also arises on transactions with a broker in relation to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the high credit quality of the broker used.
The Group monitors the credit rating and financial position of the broker used to further mitigate this risk.
Cash held as security by the counterparty to financial derivative contracts is subject to the credit risk of the counterparty.
Thefollowing table details the total number of counterparties to which the Group is exposed, the maximum exposure to any onecounterparty, the collateral held by the Group against this exposure, the total exposure to all other counterparties and the lowest long term credit rating of any one counterparty or its ultimate parent if unrated.

The Group may also be exposed to counterparty risk should there be any rehypothecation of pledged collateral.
Collateral is received paid where the client service agreement states that there should be collateral movements agreed with the counterparty, where there is a requirement for a mark-to-market process or collateralisation to ensure that the Group is protected against any counterparty default.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued Exchange traded and over-the-counter OTC financial derivative instruments When appropriate, the Group may enter into commodity futures and write both exchange traded and OTC option contracts as part of its investment policy.
Options written by the Group provide the purchaser with the opportunity to purchase from or sell the Group the underlying asset at an agreed-upon value either on or before the expiration of the option.
Options are generally settled on a net basis.
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group entered into commodity futures and wrote covered call and put option contracts to generate revenue income for the Group.
As the call and put options are covered by dedicated cash resources and no call and put option contracts were written to manage price risk, there is no impact on the Groups exposure to gearing or leverage as a result of writing covered call and put options.
No commodity futures transactions were openat 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
The notional amount of two put and one call options written that were open 2013: one put option at 31 December 2014 was 10,312,000 2013: 4,050,000.
Management of OTC financial derivative instruments Economic exposure through option writing and commodity futures transactions are monitored daily by the Investment Manager and its independent risk management team.
The Companys Board also reviews the exposures regularly.
The economic exposures to options can be closed out at any time by the Group with immediate effect.
Details of securities andexposures to market risk and credit risk implicit within the options portfolio are given in notes 18 a and 18 c to the consolidated nancialstatements.
Collateral The Group engages in activities which may require collateral to be provided to a counterparty pledged collateral or may hold collateral received inbound collateral from a counterparty.
The Group uses inbound collateral received from a counterparty to reduce the counterparty credit risk associated with any trading activity in which the Group has engaged.
Cash collateral pledged by the Group is separately identi ed as an asset in the Statements of Financial Position and is not included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
The cash is subject to certain counterparty credit risk as the Groups access to its cash could be delayed should the counterparties become insolvent or bankrupt.
The fair value of collateral pledged is re ected in the table below: Pledged collateral 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000 000 Cash collateral 1,684 1,292 [62] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC Receivables Amounts due from debtors are disclosed in the Statements of Financial Position as receivables.
The counterparties included in debtors are the same counterparties discussed previously under counterparty credit risk and subject to the same scrutiny by the BlackRock RQA Counterparty and Concentration Risk team.
The Group monitors the ageing of receivables to mitigate the risk of debtor balances becoming overdue.
In summary, the exposure to credit risk at 31 December was as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Fixed interest securities 72,913 84,952 Cash and cash equivalents 31,054 15,261 Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 6,002 6,293 109,969 106,506 There were no past due or impaired assets as at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: nil.
Management of counterparty credit risk RQA are responsible for the risk management of the Group, with duties comprising of identifying, monitoring and managing risk, including counterparty credit risk.
RQA are supported in this role by the Investment Manager.
The counterparty credit risk is managed as follows: X investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: X the Groups listed investments are held on its behalf by The Bank of New York Mellon International Limited as the Groups custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Board monitors the Groups risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports: X transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement, or on an over-the-counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk migration criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Group of default: X the creditworthiness of financial institutions with whom cash is held is reviewed regularly by the Investment Manager: and X all transactions in listed securities are settled on a payment against delivery basis using approved brokers.
Payment is made on purchase once the securities have been delivered by the broker.
The trade will fail if either party fails to meets its obligation.
Offsetting disclosures In order to better fide ne its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Group mitigate its counterparty risk, the Group may enter into an ISDA Master Agreement or similar agreement with its OTC derivative contract counterparties.
An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement between the Group and the counterparty that governs commodity futures and OTC derivative contracts and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and or termination event.
Under an ISDA Master Agreement, the Group has a contractual right to offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables and or receivables with collateral held and or posted and create one single net payment in the event of default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.
However, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on, or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other events.
For financial reporting purposes, the Group does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements in the Statements of Financial Position.
The disclosures set out in the following tables include financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

The Group is also exposed to the liquidity risk for margin calls on derivative instruments.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 30million 2013: 30 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 170 million 2013: 170 million.
For details of the overdraft and loan facility, refer to note 14.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining undiscounted gross cash out ows of the financial liabilities as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2014 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and overdraft 106,047 106,047 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 3,274 220 3,494 Derivative financial instruments written options 285 285 109,606 220 109,826 Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2013 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and overdraft 102,262 102,262 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 22,949 277 23,226 Derivative financial instruments written options 276 276 125,487 277 125,764 [64] BLACKROCK WORLD MINING TRUST P LC Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is minimised by holding suf cient liquid investments which can be readily realised to meet liquidity demands.
Asset disposals may also be required to meet liquidity needs.
However, timely sale of trading positions can be impaired by many factors including decreased trading volume and increased price volatility.
As a result, the Company may experience dif culties in disposing of assets to satisfy liquidity demands.
Liquidity risk is not signi cant as the Companys assets are investments in listed securities that are readily realisable.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain 90% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Groups assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
The Companys liquidity risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Manager in accordance with established policies and procedures in place.
The Portfolio Managers review daily forward-looking cash reports which project cash obligations.
These reports allow them to manage their obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the assets of the Company are subject to special liquidity arrangements.
d Valuation of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Statements of Financial Position at their fair value investment and derivatives or at an amount which is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
IFRS 13 requires the Company to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that re ects the signi cance of inputs used in making the measurements.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note to the Financial Statements on pages46 to 49.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signi cant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument.
These include exchange traded derivative option contracts.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Level 2 Valuation techniques used to price securities based on observable inputs.
This category includes quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active, or other valuation techniques where all signi cant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Valuation techniques used for non-standardised financial instruments such as options, currency swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives, include the use of comparable recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants making the maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity speci c inputs.
Level 3 Valuation techniques using signi cant unobservable inputs.
This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs could have a signi cant impact on the instruments valuation.
This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where signi cant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to re ect differences between the instruments and instruments for which there is no active market.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signi cant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the signi cance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require signi cant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the signi cance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement, considering factors speci c to the asset or liability.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 DECEMBER 2014 [65] Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 18.
RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES continued The determination of what constitutes observable requires signi cant judgement by the Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and veri able, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
Over-the-counter derivative option contracts have been classi ed as Level 2 investments as their valuation has been based on market observable inputs represented by the underlying quoted securities to which these contracts expose the Company.
Valuation process for unquoted royalty investments The Directors engage a mining consultant, an independent valuer with a recognised and relevant professional quali cation, to conduct a periodic valuation of the contractual rights and the fair value of the contractual rights is assessed with reference to relevant factors.
At the reporting date, the income streams from contractual rights have been valued on the net present value of the pre-tax cash ows discounted at a rate the external valuer considers re ects the risk associated with the project.
The valuation model uses discounted cash ow analysis which incorporates both observable and non-observable data.
Observable inputs include assumptions regarding current rates of interest and commodity prices.
Unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding production pro les, price realisations, cost of capital and discount rates.
In determining the discount rate to be applied, the external valuer considers the country and sovereign risk associated with the project, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.
The external valuer has undertaken an analysis of the impact of using alternative discount rates on the fair value of contractual rights.
This investment in contractual rights is reviewed regularly to ensure that the initial classi cation remains correct given the assets characteristics and the Groups investment policies.
The contractual rights are initially recognised using the transaction price as the best evidence of fair value at acquisition and are subsequently measured at fair value, taking into consideration the relevant IFRS 13 requirements.
In arriving at their estimates of market values, the valuers have used their market knowledge and professional judgement.
The Group classi es the fair value of such investments as Level 3.
Valuations are the responsibility of the Directors of the Company.
In arriving at a final valuation, the Directors consider the independent valuers report, the signi cant assumptions used in the fair valuation and the review process undertaken by the Pricing Committee.
The valuation of unquoted investments is performed on a quarterly basis by the Fund Manager and reviewed by the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
On a quarterly basis the Fund Manager will review the valuation of the contractual rights and inputs for signi cant changes.
A valuation of contractual rights is performed annually by an external valuer and reviewed by the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the Pricing Committee.
On a semi-annual basis, after the checks above have been performed, the Investment Manager presents the valuation results to the Directors.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations.
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
