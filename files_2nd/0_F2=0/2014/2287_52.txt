At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 71.7m 2013: 146.5m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 10.4m 2013: 12.9m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 61.3m 2013: 133.6m of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability.
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of 0.2m 2013: 0.4m relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has not been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
Includes movements between current tax and deferred tax.
