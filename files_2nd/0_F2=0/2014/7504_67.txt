Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements Internal audit The Committee considers and approves the internal audit plan which is based on an assessment of the key risks faced by the Group.
Progress in respect of the plan is monitored throughout the year and care is taken to ensure that the internal audit function has sufficient resource to complete the plan.
The audit plan may be reviewed during the year as a result of the ongoing assessment of the key risks or in response to the needs of the business.

He attends all meetings of the Committee and reports regularly to the Group Risk Committee.
A quarterly report on completed internal audits is presented to the Committee and, where appropriate, action plans are reviewed.
In addition, all grade 1 audit reports are circulated to the Committee as soon as they are finalised so any issues can be addressed in a timely manner.
During the year, the effectiveness of the internal audit function was assessed by the Assurance, Risk and Best Practice Director and the Committee.
By order of the Audit & Risk Committee.
