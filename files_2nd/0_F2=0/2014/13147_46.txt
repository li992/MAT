Goodwill is compiled and assessed among groups of cash generating units CGUs, which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
Typically, acquisitions are integrated into existing business units, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
As the business areas have become increasingly integrated and globalised, management has reviewed the allocation of goodwill to groups of CGUs.
In order to reect the global leverage of assets, skills, knowledge and technology platforms, and consequential changes to the monitoring of goodwill by management, the number of groups of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated has been reduced from 25 in 2013 to 5 in 2014.
Reducing the number of groups of CGUs had no impact on the carrying values of goodwill, which are set out below: GOODWILL 2014 2013 m m scientific, Technical & Medical 1,109 1,051 Risk Solutions 1,779 1,604 Business Information 480 374 Legal 1,199 1,121 Exhibitions 414 426 Total 4,981 4,576 The key assumptions for each group of CGUs are disclosed below.
