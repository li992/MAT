Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2014 | 107 Company Financial Performance A nine year record of the Companys Financial Performance is provided below.
Prior to the financial year ended 31 January 2007 there were two trusts, The Alliance Trust and The Second Alliance Trust, and the figures are therefore not directly comparable.
This explains why we have only shown a nine year record.
From 2015, we will display a 10 year record.
