The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is valued at 31 December 2014 by CBRE Ltd. Valuation for the APP joint venture properties was performed by Jones Lang LaSalle Limited and CBRE Ltd for Big Box.
LPP was valued by Jones Lang LaSalle Limited for 2013, at which time it was a joint venture and now, as a wholly owned entity, it is valued as part of the CBRE Ltd valuation.
Valuations for the joint venture properties in Continental Europe were performed by CBRE Ltd with BNP Paribas acting as joint valuers for SELP in France.
The valuations conform to International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties.
In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use.
There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year.
CBRE Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Limited and BNP Paribas also undertake some professional and agency work on behalf of the Group, although this is limited in relation to the activities of the Group as a whole.
The firms advise us that the total fees paid by the Group represent less than 5 per cent of their total revenue in anyyear.
