Beware of share fraud in recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas-based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
The brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
You can find out more information on how share fraud works and how to avoid it on the Financial Conduct Authority website at www.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
