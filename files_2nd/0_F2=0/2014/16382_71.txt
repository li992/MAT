NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 20.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised at the lower of fair value at the date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there isa chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.
