Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated and Company financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 2 j Revenue r ecognition and the associated deferral, specifically regarding the period to which services relate, when specific products have expired and the recognition of revenue from membership offers including discounted or free periods.
Notes 16 and 24 The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value for new share-based incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured.
The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Companys shares at the grant date, expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted average expected life of the instrument.
In respect of share options granted to employees, the number of options that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the number of employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market-based performance conditions being satisfied.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
2 Significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004. ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property website.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software and licences Computer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20.0% 33.3% per annum Software licences 20.0% 33.3% per annum c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Office equipment, fixtures & fittings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% 33.3% per annum Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease d Impairment The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Rightmove plc annual report 2014 79 Notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the receivables original terms.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
g Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
A provision is maintained in respect of lease dilapidations based on an estimated cost to make good per square foot multiplied by the floor area of each premise.
h Employee benefits i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme a defined contribution pension plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary exchange.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due.
ii Employee share schemes The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other selected senior management to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
Fair value is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
When either the employee or the Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
iv National Insurance NI on share-based incentives Employers NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based incentives are exercised.
In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred shares, it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.

n Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Rightmove plc annual report 2014 81 Notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include the income tax effect of the tax deduction in profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.

More than 90.0% 2013: 90.0% of the Groups agency and new homes customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.

The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders as well as underlying basic earnings per share.
The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to profit growth.
The Boards policy is to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.

There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Rightmove plc annual report 2014 83 Notes continued 4 Risk and capital management continued Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour.
Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions: requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions: compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements: documentation of controls and procedures: requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the risks identified: requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action: development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans: training and professional development: and risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.

24 Share-based payments The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and other selected senior management employees.
Since flotation, the Company has awarded share options under the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan Unapproved Plan and the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan Approved Plan.
The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Plan, a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSP and in May 2011 the Rightmove Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced.
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received.
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
During 2013 the Group amended the rules of the Unapproved Plan to enable such awards to be net settled whereby the number of shares released by the EBT and sold to satisfy the award is equivalent to the gain due to the option holder.
Consequently no proceeds are received by the EBT on exercise of unapproved share options.
The total share-based payments charge for the year relating to all share-based incentive plans was 2,728,000 2013: 2,408,000.
A 2% reduction or increase in the employee leaver assumption excluding executive directors for the DSP and the PSP would have increased decreased the share-based payments charge in the year by 23,000 2013: 40,000.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date.
NI for the year ended 31 December 2014 relating to all awards was a credit of 194,000 compared to a charge of 4,538,000 in the prior year, due to a reduction in the share price from 27.40 at 31 December 2013 to 22.48 at 31 December 2014.
The total Company NI for the year was a credit of 301,000 and a charge of 4,043,000 in the prior year.

These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options.

The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and past employee behaviour.
The Sharesave options outstanding at 31 December 2014 have an exercise price in the range of 9.98 to 19.72 2013: 5.53 to 18.96 and a weighted average contractual life of 2.3 years 2013: 2.4 years.

Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a performance condition.
140,618 PSP awards were made on 3 March 2014 the Grant Date subject to EPS and TSR performance.
Performance will be measured over three financial years 1 January 2014 31 December 2016.
The vesting in March 2017 Vesting Date of 25% of the 2014 PSP award will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three year performance period and the vesting of the 75% of the 2014 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three year performance period.
PSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date and this value will be delivered in shares.
