NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 11.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: Cash generating unit 2014 2013 000 000 Fresh pork 12,231 12,231 Livestock 1,691 - Cooked meats 90,167 90,167 Sandwiches 11,602 11,602 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 Other 3,359 3,359 130,018 128,327 88 Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2014 Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Strategic Report Financial Statements Assumptions used The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter capital is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 3 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information, including Kantar Worldpanel data.
A pre-tax discount rate of 7.4 per cent has been used 2013: 8.3 per cent being managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Sales volumes Sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices, and the quality of our products and service.
Historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
Historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience and with reference to budget forecasts.
Discount rates All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
Managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash generating unit.
Sensitivity Following the impairment of goodwill attributable to the Sandwiches cash generating unit in 201112, management believes that currently there is no reasonably possible change to the assumptions that would reduce the value in use below the value of the carrying amount for any of the Groups cash generating units.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
