Financial statements Notes to the annual fi financial statements continued 14.
Reclassifi cations of fi financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassifi ed certain fi financial instruments out of fair value through profi t or loss.
These assets were originally classifi ed as held-for-trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassifi ed 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifi cations, respectively.
The amount reclassifi ed refl ected the fair value of the fi financial assets at the date of reclassifi cation.
The group did not undertake any further reclassifi cations under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year and in the prior year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassifi ed: 2014 2013 Carrying Carrying At 31 March 000 value Fair value value Fair value Trading assets reclassifi ed to loans and receivables 31 746 16 441 46 025 26 784 31 746 16 441 46 025 26 784 If the reclassifi cations had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2014 would have reduced by 3.9 million 2013: a decrease of 8.6 million.
In the current year the reclassifi ed assets have contributed a 268 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 4.1 million through impairments before taxation.
In the prior year, after the reclassifi cation, the assets contributed a 372 000 loss through the margin line and a loss of 4.9 million through impairments before taxation.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses recurring fair value measurements for fi financial assets and fi financial liabilities.
These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The different levels are identifi ed as follows: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.
Fair value disclosures on investment properties are included in the Investment properties note 33 on page 81.
