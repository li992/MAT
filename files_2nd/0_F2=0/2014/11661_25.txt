Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Company information Notes to the Financial Statements year ended 31 March 2014 1 Non-GAAP measures The Directors present the following non-GAAP measures as they consider that they give a better indication of the underlying performance of the business.
Reconciliation between profit before income tax and adjusted profit 2013 2014 Restated m m Profit before income tax 24.0 28.4 Reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory 3.7 0.5 Acquisition related costs 7.8 2.1 Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 14.7 13.8 Unwind of discount in respect of deferred consideration 0.9 0.2 Mark to market gain loss in respect of derivative financial instruments 4.1 2.0 Settlement loss on US pension scheme 0.1 Adjusted profit before income tax 47.1 47.0 Share of taxation 8.7 9.7 Adjusted profit for the year 38.4 37.3 See Accounting Policies for details of restatement of comparative information.
The reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory are excluded from adjusted profit to provide a measure that includes results from acquired businesses on a consistent basis over time to assist comparison of performance.
Acquisition related costs comprise professional fees incurred in relation to mergers and acquisitions activity, post acquisition restructuring costs and any consideration which, under IFRS 3 revised, falls to be treated as a post acquisition employment expense.
In common with a number of other companies adjusted profit excludes the non-cash amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, along with the unwind of discounts in respect of deferred consideration.
During the year the Group purchased annuities for 27 members of the US defined benefit pension scheme.
A settlement loss of 0.1m crystallised on purchase.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are also measured at fair value.
In respect of instruments used to hedge foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk the Group does not take advantage of the hedge accounting rules provided for in IAS 39 since that standard requires certain stringent criteria to be met in order to hedge account, which, in the particular circumstances of the Group, are considered by the Board not to bring any significant economic benefit.
Accordingly, the Group accounts for these derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
To the extent that instruments are hedges of future transactions, adjusted profit for the year is stated before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the underlying performance of the Group can bemore clearly seen.
In calculating the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in 2011 a one-off recognition of deferred tax assets relating to the Groups UK businesses of 11.3m was excluded.
At that time the Group announced its intention to exclude the reversal of this deferred tax from the calculation of the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in the years in which it reverses.
In the current period deferred tax of 2.2m 2013: 3.3m has reversed and consequently been excluded from the tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax.

Basic and adjusted earnings are divided by the weighted average number ofordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust.
2013 2014 Restated m m Basic earnings 18.2 21.0 Adjusted earnings Note 1 38.4 37.3 Weighted average number of shares 56.8 56.2 pence pence Basic earnings per share 32.1 37.4 Adjusted earnings per share 67.7 66.5 See Accounting Policies for details of restatement of comparative information.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation excludes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust, as follows: 2014 2013 Shares Shares million million Weighted average number of shares outstanding 57.0 56.4 Less shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust 0.2 0.2 Weighted average number of shares used in calculation of basic earnings per share 56.8 56.2 The following table shows the effect of share options on the calculation of diluted earnings per share: 2014 2013 Shares Shares million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares per basic earnings per share calculations 56.8 56.2 Effect of shares under option 0.4 0.6 Weighted average number of ordinary shares per diluted earnings per share calculations 57.2 56.8 3 Segment information The Group has seven operating segments.
These operating segments have been combined into three aggregated operating segments to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics, with relevance to products and services, type and class of customer, methods of sale and distribution and the regulatory environment in which they operate.
Each of these three aggregated operating segments is a reportable segment.
The Groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the three aggregated operating segments on the basis ofthe economic characteristics discussed below: the Nanotechnology Tools segment contains a group of businesses, supplying similar products, characterised by a high degree of customisation and high unit prices.
These are the Groups highest technology products serving research customers in both the public and private sectors.
Theresults of Andor Technology, acquired during the year, are included in this segment: the Industrial Products segment contains a group of businesses supplying high technology products and components manufactured in medium volume for industrial customers: and the Service segment contains the Groups service business as well as service revenues from other parts of the Group.
Reportable segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
The operating results of each are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Board of Directors.
Discrete financial information is available for each segment and used by the Board of Directors for decisions on resource allocation and to assess performance.
No asset information is presented below as this information is not presented in reporting to the Groups Board of Directors.

Participating employees make a cash contribution to the plan each month.
The Group contributes a further amount equal to 20% of the employees contribution.
Independent trustees then purchase matching shares in the market on behalf of the employees.
The matching shares vest on the completion by the participating employee of a further three years service and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years service.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESO Options awarded under the Executive Share Option Scheme are made annually to certain senior managers.
The exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price on the day before the date of grant.
Options have a life of ten years and a vesting period of three years.
Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme SELTIS Options awarded under the Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are made annually to certain senior managers.
The exercise prices are nil.
Options have a life of seven years and a vesting period of three years.
Both the Executive Share Option Scheme and Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are subject to performance conditions which can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 65.
Administrative expenses include a charge of 1.6m 2013: 1.4m in respect of the cost of providing share options.
The cost is calculated by estimating the fair value of the option at grant date and spreading that amount over the vesting period after adjusting for an expectation of non-vesting.
Fair values are determined using an internal valuation model based on a modified Black-Scholes model.
Expected volatility has been based on historical volatility over a period of time of the same length as the expected option life and ending on the grant date.
Half of the ESO options issued before 2009 and all SELTIS options use Total Shareholder Return TSR as a performance condition.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to non-market performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance conditions have been incorporated into the calculation of the fair value as a discount in calculating the fair value.
For options granted in the years ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme Executive Share Option Scheme December March June December 2012 2014 2013 2012 Fair value at measurement date 9.74 4.99 5.49 5.16 Share price at grant date 13.85 12.72 14.55 13.85 Exercise price nil 12.89 14.55 13.88 Expected volatility 36.1% 41.8% 40.7% 40.6% Expected option life expressed as weighted average life used in the modelling 3 years 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected dividend yield 0.7% 0.9% 0.8% 0.7% Risk free interest rate 0.5% 2.1% 1.5% 1.2% No options were granted under the Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme during the year.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to individual CGUs as follows: 2014 2013 m m Nanotechnology Tools NanoScience 2.2 2.3 NanoAnalysis 3.9 4.2 Asylum 8.8 9.8 Omicron 0.4 Unallocated 83.0 Industrial Products Industrial Analysis 4.0 3.2 Magnetic Resonance 2.3 2.3 Austin Scientific 1.6 1.7 Service OI Service 0.6 0.6 106.4 24.5 Unallocated goodwill of 83.0m relates to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Andor Technology plc see Note 6.
Since fair values acquired remain provisional and synergistic savings have not yet been fully forecast, the goodwill has not yet been allocated to CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Accounting standards require an impairment test to be carried out by determining the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit which contains goodwill.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use of the CGU.
In the Groups case the recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations, with the exception of Andor.
Value in use is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows and in particular Board-approved three year cash flow forecasts, prepared by the management of each CGU, are used together with 2.5% 2013: 2.5% per annum growth for each CGU for the subsequent 20 years.
This growth rate is considered to be at or below long term market trends for the Groups businesses.
The Andor CGU has not been tested for impairment based on its fair value less costs to sell.
The Directors consider the recent arms length transaction to be reflective of the fair value of the assets acquired.
The Omicron business, part of the Nanotechnology Tools sector, was acquired in 2011.
It has underperformed against expectations and, consequently, during the year the Group made changes to its management and laid out a new strategy.
Management have reviewed the carrying values of the intangible assets which initially arose on acquisition of Omicron.
As a result of that review the carrying value of the intangible assets in respect ofits brand name and acquired development costs have been impaired to zero.
This has resulted in charges to the income statement of 0.4m and 1.8m respectively.
Additionally, an impairment charge of 0.4m has been made against the remaining carrying value of the goodwill of theOmicron CGU.
Key assumptions The key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected selling volumes and prices and direct costs during the period.
The growth rates are based on industry growth factors.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations offuture changes in the market.
The pre-tax weighted average costs of capital used for Nanotechnology Tools, Industrial Products and Service in impairment testing are 10.95%11.45% 2013: 12.25%, 10.45%10.95% 2013: 11.75% and 10.45% 2013: 11.25% respectively in line with the risk associated with each of the business segments.
Management have estimated these discount rates by reference to past experience and an industry average weighted cost ofcapital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reflecting current economic circumstances and the risk profiles of each CGU.
Report and Financial Statements 2014 Oxford Instruments plc 99 www.
com Notes to the Financial Statements continued year ended 31 March 2014 15 Intangible assets continued Sensitivity analysis The Groups estimate of impairments are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate and forecast cash flows.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to both of these assumptions.
This demonstrated that an impairment would only be required if there were an increase in the discount rates by 58% 2013: 23% or more or a greater than 36% 2013: 19% reduction in forecast cash flows on the CGU with the lowest level of headroom.
Sensitivity testing on the other CGUs shows an even greater level of headroom.
Based on the above, the Group considers that its impairment calculations are not sensitive to any reasonable change to the key assumptions.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in the subsidiaries concerned against which the Group can utilise the brought forward tax losses.

In other cases the Group considers that it is able to control the timing of remittances so that any tax is not expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax balance at 31 March 2014 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% which was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The valuation allowance is reduced and the asset impaired when the customer is in liquidation.
19 Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury function that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
Commodity risk is managed locally by the operating businesses.
The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for a limited number of related commodity contracts as outlined below.
However, in common with anumber of other companies, the Group has decided that the additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IAS 39 toapply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments used for hedging exposure to foreign currency and interest rate volatility cannot bejustified.
Accordingly the Group does not use hedge accounting for such derivatives.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
To reduce uncertainty the Group maintains a rolling hedge equivalent to 80% ofthe exposure expected to arise over the following 12 months.
The hedge comprises a mixture of fixed forward contracts and option based products.
The remaining 20% is sold on the spot market as it arises.
The fair value of outstanding currency contracts recognised as a liability asat31 March 2014 amount to 0.4m 2013: 2.5m and those recognised as an asset amount to 5.3m 2013: 2.2m.
Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income immediately.
However, inorder to facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the Groups performance year on year the element of these movements that relate to hedges in respect of future sales are treated as an adjusting item in the calculation of adjusted earnings see Note 1.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Statement of Income and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Statements of Income of overseas subsidiaries.
102 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2014 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Company information 19 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
The Groups policy is to use a mixture of revolving short and medium term floating rate debt under pinned by longer term fixed rate debt.
The short and medium term floating rate debt provides flexibility to reduce debt levels as appropriate.
Thelonger term fixed rate debt provides stability and cost certainty to the Groups financing structure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining adequate committed lines of funding from high quality lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 March 2014 are set out in Note 22. Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
In particular a Board approved policy sets out guidelines for which categories of institutions may be used and the maximum amount which may be invested with each institution within a particular category.
Accordingly the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Group Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2014 was 114.4m 2013: 107.1m.
2014 2013 m m Trade receivables 73.7 59.8 Other receivables 2.8 5.9 Cash and cash equivalents 32.6 39.2 Forward exchange contracts 5.3 2.2 114.4 107.1 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in Note 18.
Other receivables include 1.5m 2013: 0.8m in respect of VAT and similar taxes which are not past due date.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly in respect of copper used as a major component in one of the Groups USA operations.
It manages this exposure using derivative commodity hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had outstanding commodity hedge contracts with a fair value liability of 0.1m 2013: 0.1m liability that were designated and effective as cash flow hedges of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.
Fair value movements of these contracts have been deferred in equity until the hedged transaction takes place.
These contracts all mature within one year of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
A 0.1m loss net of tax 2013: 0.1m loss has been deferred in equity as at 31 March 2014 in respect of these contracts.
A loss of 0.2m 2013:0.2m loss has been recycled to current assets inventory in respect of contracts designated as cash flow hedges that have matured during the year to 31 March 2014.
Report and Financial Statements 2014 Oxford Instruments plc 103 www.
com Notes to the Financial Statements continued year ended 31 March 2014 19 Financial risk management continued Capital management The Board considers capital to comprise share capital, reserves and the net cash or net debt position of the Company.
The Company was in a net debt position at the year end.
Total capital at the end of the current year totalled 264.5m 2013: 98.5m.
The Boards long term objective is to have an efficient capital structure by maintaining a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
This is monitored by reference to the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and the Board has set itself internal limits, which are well inside any covenants the Group has with lenders.
The Group maintains the right to purchase its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases would depend on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
The Board carefully considers dividend payments and the Company moved from a fixed dividend policy to a progressive one in the year ended March 2011.
In doing this the Board will look to increase dividends as adjusted earnings per share increase although there will not be a direct correlation.
The Board does not have a policy to pay a fixed dividend yield or to maintain a fixed rate of dividend cover, but assess both of these metrics together with dividends paid by peers when assessing what dividend to recommend.
As set out in the Chief Executives Statement the Groups strategy is to grow its business in its core markets of physical and materials science and to exploit convergence to expand into life sciences.
An essential part of this will be to make acquisitions.
In line with the objective of maintaining a balance between borrowings and equity the Group would seek to finance smaller bolt-on acquisitions from operating cash flow thus maintaining balance sheet efficiency.
Larger acquisitions would be financed either by equity or a mixture of equity and debt so as to ensure the Group has a manageable ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
As well as various share option plans full details of which are given in Note 11, from April 2008 all UK employees have been offered the opportunity to take part in a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Under this plan, employees are able to invest up to 1,500 each tax year in shares in the Company.
The Company awards one additional free share a matching share for every five shares bought by each employee.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

104 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2014 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Company information 20 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are marked to market using market prices.
Fixed and floating rate borrowings The fair value of fixed and floating rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted principal and interest cash flows using the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine their fair value.
Advances received are excluded from other payables above as these are not considered to be financial liabilities.
Contingent consideration The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated based on the forecast future performance of the acquired business over a specific future timeframe.
Fair value hierarchy The table above gives details of the valuation method used in arriving at the fair value of financial instruments.
The different levels have been identified as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.

The sensitivities above represent the Directors view of reasonably possible changes in each risk variable, not worst case scenarios or stress tests.
The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur at the year end and are applied to the risk exposures at that date.
Accordingly they show the impact on the balance sheet of an instantaneous shock.
The calculations include all hedges in place at the year end.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
As such this table should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses.
