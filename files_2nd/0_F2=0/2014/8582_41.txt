ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs In this section...
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing costs, including its balance sheet liquidity and access to capital markets.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the Group, as seen through the repurchase of the bilateral loan during the year.
Any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
In 2014, a Tax and Treasury committee was established, acting under delegated authority from the Board, in order to approve certain financial transactions and to monitor compliance with the Groups tax and treasury policies.
4.1 Net cash Keeping it simple... Net cash is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources net of the current outstanding debt.
Adjusted net debt is also monitored by the Group and more closely reflects how credit agencies see the Groups gearing.
To arrive at the adjusted net debt amount, we add our total expected contingent payments on acquisitions, our IAS 19 pension deficit and our undiscounted operating lease commitments.
A full analysis and discussion of adjusted net debt is included in the Financial and Performance Review.
In defining total outstanding debt the Directors consider it appropriate to include the currency impact of swaps held against specific debt instruments.

The Group borrows money from financial institutions in the form of bonds, bank facilities and other financial instruments.
The interest payable on these instruments is shown in the net financing costs note innote 4.4.
There are Board-approved policies in place to manage the Groups financial risks.
Macroeconomic market risks, which impact currency transactions and interest rates, are discussed in note 4.3. Credit and liquidity risks are discussed below.
Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations: and Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments.
Here, fair value is the amount the Group would pay to transfer the liability.
It is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
This calculation of fair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 2 in note 4.6.

A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.
A derivatives value changes over time in response to underlying variables such as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period.
A hedge is where a derivative is used to manage an underlying exposure.
The Group is exposed to certain market risks, principally to changes in interest rates on its net borrowings and to changes in foreign exchange rates on its foreign currency transactions, profits and net assets.
In accordance with Board approved policies, which are detailed in this note, the Group manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these underlying exposures.
The key market risks facing the Group are: Currency risk arising from: i. translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities balance sheet risk and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into sterling income statement risk : and ii.
transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups trading cash flows in various currencies.
Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest rate risk: Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk arising from short term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency: Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date: and Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one type of floating rate for another, and are used to manage interest rate risk.
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.

The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position at fair value.
