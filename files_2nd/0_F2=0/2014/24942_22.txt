Statement of Directors Responsibilities Statement The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditors statement of their responsibilities set out in their report on pages 329 to 333, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the Auditor in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 comprising the consolidated financial statements of HSBC Holdings and its subsidiaries the Group and holding company financial statements for HSBC Holdings the parent company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this report has confirmed that, so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware and the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation was given pursuant to section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 and should be interpreted in accordance with and subject to those provisions.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
The Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as endorsed by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as endorsed by the EU to present fairly the financial position, the performance for that period and for IFRSs purposes the cash flows of the Group and the parent company.
The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In addition, in order to meet certain US requirements, HSBC is required to present its financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Currently, there are no differences in application to HSBC between IFRSs endorsed by the EU and IFRSs issued by the IASB.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as endorsed by the EU: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue in business.
Since the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for preparing, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, a Strategic Report, a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Report on pages 1 to 327 of this Annual Report and Accounts 2014 and for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 as they appear on the Companys website.
UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, the names of whom are set out in the Report of the Directors: Corporate Governance section on pages 264 to 268 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2014, confirm that: to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the parent company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: to the best of their knowledge, the management report represented by the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the parent company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face: and they consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 2014, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the parent companys performance, business model and strategy.
