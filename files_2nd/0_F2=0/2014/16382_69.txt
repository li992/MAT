FINANCIAL ASSETS CONTINUED million million Cash and cash equivalents reconciliation to the cash flow statement 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents per balance sheet 2,151 2,285 Less: bank overdrafts 241 241 Cash and cash equivalents per cash flow statement 1,910 2,044 Approximately 1.7 billion or 81% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis.
For most countries this is done through dividends free of tax.
In a few countries we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available in any means for general use by the wider business.
The amount of cash held in these countries was 452 million 2013: 243 million.
The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13.
These risks are generally managed by local controllers.
Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis.
This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings.
Individual risk limits are set for each counterparty based on financial position, credit rating and past experience.
Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Groups treasury department.
Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilevers principal counter-parties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party.
To further reduce the Groups creditexposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilevers principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2014 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to24 million 2013:9 million, of which 24 million 2013: 5 million was in cash, and nil 2013: 4 million was in the form of bond securities.
The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Groups balance sheet.
Further details in relation to the Groups exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK The Group is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of financial instruments.

The instruments that have a fair value that is different from the carrying amount are classified as Level 2 for both 2013 and 2014.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK CONTINUED FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The fair values shown above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique.
Thecategories used are as follows: Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments: Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs: and Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarised below: million million million million million million million million Total fair Total fair Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 2 Level 3 Level 3 value value Notes 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Assets at fair value Other cash equivalents 17A 221 91 221 91 Available-for-sale financial assets 17A 15 8 158 276 498 476 671 760 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: a Derivatives 16C 417 376 417 376 Other 17A 119 25 3 7 122 32 Liabilities at fair value b Derivatives 16C 514 395 514 395 a Includes 121 million 2013: 82 million derivatives, reported within trade receivables, that hedge trading activities.
b Includes 164 million 2013: 96 million derivatives, reported within trade payables, that hedge trading activities.
There were no significant changes in classification of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities since 31 December 2013.
There were also no significant movements between the fair value hierarchy classifications since 31 December 2013.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their short-term nature.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets is given below: million million Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations 2014 2013 1 January 483 506 Gains and losses recognised in profit and loss 3 2 Gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income 17 5 Purchases and new issues 4 29 Sales and settlements 49 Transfers into Level 3 Transfers out of Level 3 31 December 501 483 SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES The only individually material asset valued using Level 3 techniques is a particular unlisted investment with a carrying value at year end of 189 million 2013: 190 million.
A change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change fair value significantly.
CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2013.
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.
The fair values of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.
For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.
