The amortisation charge represents the spreading of the cost over the assets expected useful lives: the Strathmore customer relationships were fully amortised in the year to 28 January 2012 and the Rubicon asset has five years remaining.
This period has been reviewed at the statement of financial position date and remains appropriate.
The amortisation costs for the year to 26 January 2014 have been included in the income statement as administration costs.

Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are: Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 26 January 2014 000 000 000 000 Rubicon operating unit 21,036 42,986 1,183 65,205 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 8,902 Total 22,938 49,986 1,183 74,107 Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 26 January 2013 000 000 000 000 Rubicon operating unit 21,036 42,986 1,436 65,458 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 8,902 Total 22,938 49,986 1,436 74,360 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. 106 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2014 2013 Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate Gross margin Growth rate Discount rate % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 31.20 2.25 8.40 32.85 2.25 9.85 Strathmore operating unit 26.40 2.25 8.40 31.98 2.25 9.85 The Rubicon operating unit can be further allocated across carbonates and still drinks when determining the CGU required for impairment testing.
No impairment was identified through this allocation.
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each operating unit.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the analysis, using latest annual budgets for the year to 25 January 2015 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At a pre-tax rate of 12%, neither of the CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the impairment conclusions reached.
