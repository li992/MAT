Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 49.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors report on page 69.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2014 include the results of the rail business for the year to 31 March 2014 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2014.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2013 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2013 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2013.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of their fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Restatement of prior year numbers The following tables show the restated prior year comparative figures for the divisions and for the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2013.
The restatement reflects a the retrospective adjustment from the adoption of the changes in IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised, b the reclassification of certain exceptional items and c the retrospective adjustment of earnings per share figures as required by IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, reflecting the rights issue completed in June 2013. a IAS 19 revised IAS 19 revised applies to financial years beginning on 1 January 2013 or later.
The key impact on the Group from the revised standard will be to remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities and replace them with one single discount rate for the net deficit.
The actual benefits and the cash contributions for these plans are not impacted by IAS 19 revised.
b Exceptional items The Directors have decided to reclassify certain generally recurring costs that were previously treated as exceptional.
Principally these relate to costs incurred relating to bidding for rail franchises and the profit loss on disposal of properties.
c Rights issue Pursuant to the rights issue, on 10 June 2013, 722,859,586 new ordinary shares of 5 pence each were issued, with three new ordinary shares issued for every two existing ordinary shares held.
As a result the total issued share capital increased to 1,204.9m ordinary shares.
For the calculation of earnings per share, the number of shares held prior to 10 June 2013 has been increased by a factor of 1.227 to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.

The incremental loss for the year to 31 March 2013 of 10.5m has been treated as a prior year adjustment as at 1 April 2012 with utilisation of 10.5m in the year to 31 March 2013 respectively.
2 The incremental loss on the First Great Western contract of 6.0m for the 7 period extension to October 2013 has been included in the restatement of the exceptional charge for the year to 31 March 2013. Business segments and geographical information The presentation of total assets and total liabilities by business segment for March 2013 has been restated to be consistent with how the Directors view the business.
Segment assets and liabilities are determined by identifying the assets and liabilities that relate to the business of each segment but excluding intercompany balances, net debt and taxation.
FirstGroup 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisitions method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment and non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not constitute control or joint control over those policies.
As a general rule, significant influence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting power, of the investee.
However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power, does not have significant influence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate.
The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have significant influence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs, which are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: Customer contracts over the estimated life of the contract 9 to 10 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the estimated life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the initial term of the franchise 2 to 10 years In the event of a franchise extension a new intangible asset is set up and is amortised over the term of the extension on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as the proportion of total services to be provided.
Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within trade and other payables under the heading of season ticket deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
FirstGroup 102 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable under franchise revenue support arrangements.
Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies see note 24 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after amortisation charges and exceptional items but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their size, nature, relationship to current trading activities and or infrequency, require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the underlying financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
Subsequent revisions to the same exceptional items are also recognised as an exceptional item in future periods.
In the current year exceptional items principally relate to business disposals and the residual release of the First Great Western provision, which was previously recognised as exceptional, but is now no longer required.
In the prior year exceptional items principally related to aged legal claims associated with previous acquisitions, business disposals, revisions to onerous contract provisions previously recognised as exceptional items and the isolated recovery of UK rail bid costs.
FirstGroup 103 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight-line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight-line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 17 years straight-line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight-line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
FirstGroup 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Capital grants Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups UK Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the TOCs up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
FirstGroup 105 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability.
The fuel swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks.
The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating to part of the Groups net investment in US Dollar denominated assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Self-insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
In addition there are typically a smaller number of major claims during a financial year which may be subject to an insurance deductible.
To provide protection against these major losses, cover is obtained through third party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
FirstGroup 106 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods IAS IFRS standards starting on or after Amendments to IAS 36 May 2013 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets 1 January 2014 IFRIC 21 Levies 1 January 2014 Amendments to IAS 32 December 2011 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2017 1 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2013 1 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 1 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 1 Mandatory for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2014 under EU adopting regulations.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the Group has applied a number of new and revised IAS IFRSs.
None of these have resulted in a material impact with the exception of IAS 19 revised, which has had a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet.
In accordance with the amendments to IAS 1, the Group has presented a third balance sheet as at 31 March 2012 without the related notes except for the disclosure requirements of IAS 8 Accounting Polices, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors as shown in note 2.
The application of IFRS 13 has not had a material impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements other than the additional disclosures that are required under this IFRS.
This has been disclosed in note 24.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgments and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,509.5m 2013: 1,665.8m: 2012: 1,599.3m as set out in note 12 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 217.9m 2013: 281.8m: 2012: 318.8m as set out in note 13.
FirstGroup 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Contract and franchise accounting Judgments are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilities arising from franchises and long term service contracts.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and contracts, which require assessments and judgments relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, the life of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date.
The residual value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the period of operation.
In particular UK Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail.
Due to the regulated nature of the UK Rail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other Train Operating Companies TOCs where one or more TOCs have access to common infrastructure such as railway lines.
Judgment is required by management as to the amounts receivable and also payable taking account of the information available at the time.
In the current year particular judgments related to the First Great Western contract provision see note 5 and the evaluation of other potential onerous contracts.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these are the discount rate and inflation rate assumptions.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 29m respectively.
A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 21m respectively.
The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was 260.7m 2013: 247.8m: 2012: 267.9m as set out in note 35.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The Groups total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were 294.8m 2013: 332.6m: 2012: 336.0m as set out in note 26.

UK Bus depot sales and closures UK Bus depot sales and closures relate to measures taken by the Group to rebalance its portfolio in the UK Bus operations, which included selling or closing certain operations.
The principal amount in the period represents a 16.5m gain on the disposal of the eight London bus depots, which completed during the year, offset by 3.5m of losses on depots sold or closed.
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision The total loss in the final seven periods of the franchise was not as high as initially projected partly due to contractual changes agreed with the DfT.
As a result 4.6m has been released as an exceptional credit.
UK Rail bid cost recoveries The Group received 12.7m of bid cost recoveries during the year to 31 March 2013 representing cost reimbursement from the DfT following the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast Franchise process.
Amortisation charges The charge for the year was 53.4m 2013: 52.0m with the increase mainly due to the amortisation of the First Great Western contract intangible recognised as a result of the contract extension partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives There was a 17.6m non-cash charge 2013: 5.5m to the income statement during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives.
The principal component of this non-cash charge relates to certain US Dollar interest rate swaps, which are no longer required as the underlying US Dollar debt was repaid from the proceeds of the rights issue.
Tax The tax credit as a result of these amortisation charges and exceptional items was 24.9m 2013: 39.4m.
In addition there was a one-off deferred tax credit of 3.2m 2013: 2.0m as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20% 2013: 24% to 23%.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2014 2013 2012 m m m Carrying amount First Student 975.7 1,081.4 1,029.6 First Transit 232.0 254.0 247.3 Greyhound 218.8 239.5 227.4 UK Bus 77.4 85.3 89.4 UK Rail 5.6 5.6 5.6 1,509.5 1,665.8 1,599.3 Impairment testing At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevant CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2014 15 and Five Year Plan projections up to 2018 19 which take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
The projections for First Student assume the incremental benefits of the existing recovery plan, and the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery.
Cash flows in 2018 19 are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2013: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2013: 3.0% for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market.
A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.0% 2013: 10.0% for the United Kingdom CGUs and 10.0% 2013: 10.0% for the North American CGUs to arrive at the value in use.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participants weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UK Rail divisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by 127.4m 2013: 258.9m.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the First Student margin or growth rates would need to fall in excess of 69 or 55 basis points respectively compared to future projections for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business.
An increase in the discount rate in excess of 45 basis points would lead to the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no further impairment to any of the CGUs.

Credit risk exists in relation to the Groups financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of 663.6m 2013: 641.0m: 2012: 601.9m, cash and cash equivalents of 553.9m 2013: 682.1m: 2012: 499.7m and derivative financial instruments of 51.9m 2013: 86.6m: 2012: 116.1m.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was 1,271.5m 2013: 1,409.7m: 2012: 1,217.7m.
The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty was 70.0m 2013: 51.3m: 2012: 81.1m at the balance sheet date.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 2.9m 2013: 3.2m: 2012: 4.5m.
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland, and city councils in the UK and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America.
The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to represent a significant credit risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
FirstGroup 119 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Trade and other receivables continued The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board.
Group treasury policy limits the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to 75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

Capital management Overall the Groups objective is to achieve a post-tax return on capital employed ROCE in the range of 10% to 12% in the medium term.
We also aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet liquidity headroom.
The Group has net debt: EBITDA of 2.2 times 2013: 3.4 times as at March 2014 and is targeting net debt: EBITDA of 2.0 times in the medium term.
ROCE is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets, excluding debt items.
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong.
At 31 March 2014 there was 988.5m 2013: 1,215.5m of committed headroom and free cash.
Largely due to seasonality in the First Student school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during the financial year through October and increases thereafter.
The Groups treasury policy requires a minimum of 250m of committed headroom at all times.
The Groups net debt, excluding accrued bond interest at 31 March 2014, was 1,303.8m 2013: 1,979.1m as set out on page 48 of the Financial review.

The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient committed liquidity resources exist.
The Group has a diversified debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance leases.
It is a policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
In May 2014, the Group signed a five year, 800.0m revolving credit facility with our relationship banks.
Largely due to the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increase again by the following March.
The average duration of net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2014 was 6.1 years 2013: 5.4 years: 2012: 5.5 years.
FirstGroup 127 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Derivative financial instruments continued The following tables detail the Groups expected maturity of payables receivables for its derivative financial instruments.
The amounts in these tables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
Total amounts receivable per the tables are 78.3m 2013: 595.7m: 2012: 701.9m.
For all years above, the tables include the settlement of principal amounts at the end of the term of the cross currency swaps.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements in exchange rates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling.
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements.
US Dollar earnings arising in the US are substantially protected by US Dollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs so that exposure to EPS on a year to year basis is not material.
Cash flow exposures are not material.
FirstGroup 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Derivative financial instruments continued IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.
2014 2013 2012 m m m Impact on profit after tax 10.9 11.8 9.9 Impact on hedging reserve 0.1 2.7 0.4 Interest rate risk The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore its net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The policy objective is primarily achieved through fixed rate debt.
The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 6.3 years 2013: 5.5 years: 2012: 5.7 years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the 250.0m pounds Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps offset the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond.
Interest income is received in January and payments are made in March and September each year.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis points 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.

The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on a net basis.

The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access to potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2014, the Group was hedged 83% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2014 to March 2016 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31 March 2015.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% p. a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.

UK The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all Group and UK Bus division employees who have joined a pension arrangement from January 2011 and April 2013, respectively.
They will receive a company match to their contributions, which varies by salary level.
The default member contribution rate is 5%, which is matched by the company, although auto-enrolees are stepping up to this level from an initial 2% matched contribution.
Auto-enrolment legislation has been implemented which requires employees to be automatically entered into a pension scheme.
This has resulted in an increase in contributions to defined contribution arrangements during the financial year compared to 2012 13.
North America Employees in the US have been able to join a defined contribution arrangement for many years.
They will receive a company match to their contributions, which varies by employment status.
The company match is 50% of member contributions, to a company maximum of 3% for full-time employees and $250 per annum for part-time employees.
All new employees in Canada join a defined contribution arrangement.
Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, dependent upon their geographical location, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan, for non-union employees.
Members of the Western and Supervisory plans can contribute 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, and receive a 50% company match.
New members of the Eastern plan from 3 October 2013 may contribute 2%, 3% or 4%, and receive a 100% company match.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of 13.6m 2013: 8.4m represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans The Group sponsors 18 funded defined benefit plans across its operations, covering approximately 80,000 former and current employees.
UK The majority of defined benefit provision is through Trust based schemes.
With the exception of the Railways Pension Schemes, these arrangements are now closed to new entrants.
In these arrangements the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards.
The Trustee board of the pension schemes is required by law, or by their Articles of Association, to act in the best interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i. e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees, beneficiaries and employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have member representation with the other Trustees being company appointed.
The Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the cost of future service is calculated and the funding position established.
The Company and Trustee board are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this.
The contributions may need to incorporate deficit recovery contributions in addition to future service contributions, if a deficit position is determined through the valuation.
If a surplus is shown at the valuation, this may be used to reduce future service contributions.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after benefits have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
The First UK Bus Pension Scheme This predominantly provides pension benefits to employees in the UK Bus division.
Historically the Scheme provided final salary benefits and career average benefits.
However, with effect from April 2012, the Scheme only provides career average benefits with a retirement age linked to State Pension age and a cap on the pensionable pay on which defined benefits can be built.
The cost of future service is split so that the employer meets 60% of the cost and the employees 40%, subject to caps and collars around employee contributions.
These caps and collars have never been utilised.
In addition there is a smaller Group scheme which provided defined benefit pensions to Group employees and executives.
This closed to new entrants in 2011.
The Railways Pension Scheme The Group currently sponsors six sections of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull Trains, its Open Access operator.
Under this scheme members build a 1 60th pension and 1 40th lump sum based upon their pensionable pay.
Some members of the Railways Pension Scheme are subject to Protected Persons legislation, which requires individual consent to changes to benefits, and certain rights upon transfer between sections of the scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement.
All costs, and any deficit or surplus is shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members.
Furthermore, under the franchising obligations, the responsibility of the employer is to pay the contributions requested of the Trustee whilst it operates the franchise.
There is no residual liability or asset for any deficit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period.
FirstGroup 139 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Retirement benefit schemes continued In calculating the Groups pension obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit which is projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
Allowance is also made in the preparation of the financial statements for the cost sharing nature of the benefit and in particular, only 60% of the total profit and loss charge and balance sheet position are attributed to the Group and recognised in the accounts.
Hull Trains is not subject to franchising obligations, and as such it is accounted for under IAS19 as a Defined Benefit scheme, although subject to the same cost sharing obligations as for the franchised sections.
Local Government Pension Schemes The Group participates in five Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS, three in England and two in Scotland.
These differ from Trust based schemes in that their benefits are prescribed by legislation, and they are administered by Local Authorities, and pension committees consisting of local councillors.
Typically the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the UK Trust based schemes.
Historically benefit accrual in these schemes has been based on final salary.
However the benefit structure is changing to a 1 47th career average benefit in England in April 2014 and in Scotland in 2015.
Normal pension age will be aligned with State Pension Age from that time.
Some members have a right to receive some of their benefits on an unreduced basis, conditional on age and service.
As with the Trust based schemes, valuations take place at least triennially.
Generally contribution rates are agreed for the three year period until the next valuation.
Whilst these are balance of cost schemes, at termination there is no right for the Company to receive any surplus in the schemes, although there is an obligation on the Company to fully fund the benefits.
To reflect this, the Group only recognise existing surpluses relating to the LGPS when determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of future company contributions.
North America US The Group operates two defined benefit arrangements in the US.
These are legacy arrangements with benefit accrual having ceased some years ago.
The schemes are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established.
Changes in funding position create new surplus or deficit each year, which is normally spread over seven years, as required by legislation.
However, funding relief passed by Congress in 2010, and again in 2012, has allowed greater flexibility following the global financial crisis.
The most recent funding relief passed in 2012 had the short term effect of increasing the funding discount rate, which acts to lower liabilities, deficits and contributions.
This effect will reduce over time.
Greyhound Canada There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees.
All these plans are now closed to new members, although benefit accrual continues for existing members.
Small executive arrangements also exist.
The plans are valued annually, where the cost of future service and the funding position are identified.
Future service costs are shared in proportion between the members and the Company, although there are caps on the member rates.
Deficit contributions are met entirely by the Company.
Cash contributions are required to fund the plans on a going concern basis, whilst the usually higher solvency deficit can be made good through a Letter of Credit.
There is a cap on the value of the Letter of Credit, which cannot exceed 15% of the value of the assets held in the plan.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 70.5% and 101.9% 2013: 61.0% and 101.9%: 2012: 61.0% and 101.9%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2014 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 3,902m 2013: 3,777m: 2012: 3,397m.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.

Consequently, the number of defined contribution members is increasing.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the Railways Pension Scheme are limited, as under the franchise arrangements, the UK Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a franchise.
As such, there is only short term cash flow risk within this business.
The key risks relating to the defined benefit pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows: Risk Description Mitigation Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference Asset liability modelling has been undertaken to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will recently in all significant plans to ensure that create a deficit.

In addition, the investment strategy reviews have led to inflation hedging, whether through swaps or holding Index Linked Gilts in the UK schemes.
Uncertainty over level Contributions to defined benefit schemes can be unpredictable and The Group is engaging with the Trustees to of future contributions volatile as a result of changes in the funding level revealed at each consider how contribution requirements can valuation.
The level of volatility and the Groups ability to control contribution levels varies between arrangements.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for Linking retirement age to UK State Pension the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an Age as in the UK Bus Pension Scheme and increase in the liabilities.
LGPS should mitigate this risk to some extent.
