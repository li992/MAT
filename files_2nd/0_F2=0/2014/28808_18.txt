NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2014 1.
General information Riverstone Energy Limited is a company limited by shares, which was incorporated on 23 May 2013 in Guernsey with an unlimited life and registered with the Guernsey Financial Services Commission as a Registered Closed-ended Collective Investment Scheme pursuant to the POI Law.
It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 29 October 2013.
The registered office of the Company is Heritage Hall, PO Box 225, Le Marchant Street, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 4HY, Channel Islands.
The Company makes its investments through the Partnership, a Cayman Islands registered exempted limited partnership, in which the Company is the sole limited partner.
The principal place of business of the Partnership is the Cayman Islands.
Both the Company and the Partnership are subject to the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Manager, a company registered in the Cayman Islands.
The Partnership invests alongside Private Riverstone Funds in all Qualifying Investments in which the Private Riverstone Funds participate.
These funds are managed and advised by affiliates of the Investment Manager, and therefore all of these parallel investments are considered to be related party transactions.
Further detail of these investments is provided in the Investment Managers Report and in Note 14.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and with the Companies Law.
The Company has adopted the Investment Entity amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 which define investment entities and provide consolidation exemptions for them together with changed disclosure requirements as described below.
Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 The Company meets the definition of an investment entity on the basis of the following criteria.
a the Company obtains funds from multiple investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services: b the Company commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c the Company measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis To determine that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity, further consideration is given to the characteristics of an investment entity that are demonstrated by the Company.
The Company makes its investments through the Partnership in which it is the sole limited partner.
The Board has assessed whether the Company has all the elements of control as prescribed by IFRS 10 in relation to the Companys investment in the Partnership and has concluded that although the Company is the sole limited partner, it does not control the Partnership but instead has significant influence resulting in its classification as a structured entity in accordance with IFRS 12, and accounted as an investment in accordance with IAS 28.
The Partnership is financed solely by the funds raised in the IPO of the Company.
Transfer of funds by the Partnership to the Company is determined by the General Partner Note 14.
The risks associated with the investment in the Partnership are the same as that of the Company, which are further disclosed in Note 15 on pages 61 to 65.
Note 7 on page 55 discloses the summarised financial information for the investment in the Partnership, which is prepared on the same basis as the financial information of the Company.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
New and amended standards and interpretations applied The following are new and amendments to existing standards and interpretations, effective from 1 January 2014: Effective Date IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 1 January 2014 New and amended standards and interpretations not applied The following new and amended standard and interpretation in issue effective from 1 January 2017 and have not been adopted by the Company and are not yet EU endorsed: Effective Date IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company, but these have not yet been evaluated in full.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is U. S. Dollars reflecting the primary economic environment in which the Company operates, that being the exploration and production and midstream energy sectors, where most transactions are expected to take place in U. S. Dollars.
The Company has chosen U. S. Dollars as its presentation currency for financial reporting purposes.
Transactions during the period, including purchases and sales of investments, income and expenses are translated into U. S. Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U. S. Dollars are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on financial instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of the Change in fair value of investments through profit or loss.
Exchange differences on other financial instruments are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as Foreign exchange loss gain.
Going concern Of the $10 million of cash retained by the Company in the IPO, $5.7 million remains at 31 December 2014.
This amount is adequate to meet the Companys liabilities as they fall due over the going concern horizon.
The Partnership has $480.4 million of uncommitted cash, money market fixed deposits and U. S. treasury bills, and has no material going concern risk.
In light of the above the Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys Statement of Financial Position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income when there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Financial assets When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company does not have any available for sale or held to maturity financial assets.
Purchases or sales of financial assets made by the Partnership that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way purchases are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Partnership commits to purchase or sell the asset.
a Investments at fair value through profit or loss i.
Classification The Companys investment in the Partnership has been classified as an investment in an associate as the Company has significant influence over the Partnership.
In accordance with the exemption within IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the Company does not account for its investment in the Partnership using the equity method.
Instead, the Company has elected to measure its investment in the Partnership at fair value through profit or loss.
Recognition Investments made by the Company in the Partnership are recognised on the day they are called.
Measurement Subsequent to initial recognition the investment in the Partnership is measured at fair value.
The Directors base the fair value of the investment in the Partnership on the value of its limited partnership capital account received from the General Partner, adjusted if necessary.
The Investment Managers assessment of fair value of investments held by the Partnership, through Investment Undertakings, is determined in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
It is the opinion of the Directors, that the IPEV valuation methodology used in deriving a fair value is generally not different from the fair value requirements of IFRS 13.
The Directors have considered whether a discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership.
In view of the investment in the Partnership and the nature of the Partnerships assets, no adjustment to the net asset value of the Partnership has been made see Note 4.
In measuring this fair value, the net asset value of the Partnership is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect liquidity, future commitments, and other specific factors of the Partnership and Investment Manager.
Fair value estimation A summary of the more relevant aspects of IPEV valuations is set out below: Marketable Listed Securities where an active market exists for the security, the value is stated at the bid price on the last trading day in the period.
Marketability discounts are not generally applied unless there is some contractual, governmental or other legally enforceable restriction preventing realisation at the reporting date.
Unlisted Investments are carried at such fair value as the Investment Manager considers appropriate given the performance of each investee company and after taking account of the effect of dilution, the exercise of ratchets, options or other incentive schemes.
Methodologies used in arriving at the fair value include prices of recent investment, earnings multiples, net assets, discounted cash flows analysis and industry valuation benchmarks.
Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions examples include discount rates, forward oil prices, production multiples and multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as EBITDA by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions, adjusted for differences between the investment and the referenced comparable.
Privately held investments may also be valued at cost for a period of time after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value.
b Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset in whole or in part is derecognised either: when the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership: or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and when it no longer has control over the assets or a portion of the asset: or when the contractual right to receive cash flow has expired.
c Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities The Companys financial liabilities consist of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
a Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost These include trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
b Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability in whole or in part is derecognised when the Company has extinguished its contractual obligations, it expires or is cancelled.
Any gain or loss on derecognition is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Equity The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity and upon issuance the fair value of the consideration received is included in equity.
All transaction costs, including share issue costs which are otherwise chargeable to equity, have been borne by the Investment Manager.
In the event that the Investment Management Agreement terminates, it would become liable for those costs.
For further details please see Note 13.. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Finance income Interest income is recognised on a time apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
Expenses Expenses include legal, accounting, auditing and other operating expenses.
They are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred on an accruals basis.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors, as a whole.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Companys Net Asset Value, as calculated under IFRS, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the Financial Statements.
For management purposes, the Company is organised into one main operating segment, which invests in one limited partnership.
All of the Companys income is derived from within Guernsey and the Cayman Islands.
All of the Companys non-current assets are located in the Cayman Islands.
Due to the Companys nature, it has no customers.
Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The main judgements made by the Company are in respect of the valuations of each portfolio company held in the Partnership and the degree of judgements due to the complexity within the wide structure of the Company, the Partnership and the Investment Undertakings.
The area involving a high degree of judgement or complexity and where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements has been identified as the risk of misstatement of the valuation of the investment in the Partnership see Note 7.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The Boards determination that no discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership involves a degree of judgement due to the nature of the Partnerships investments and other assets and liabilities see Note 2: Financial assets a iii.
The Board has assessed whether the Company has all the elements of control as prescribed by IFRS 10 in relation to the Companys investment in the Partnership and has concluded that although the Company is the sole limited partner it does not control the Partnership but instead has significant influence resulting in its classification as an investment in associate.
The Boards determination that the Companys investment in the Partnership is an associate investment involves a degree of judgement due to the complexity within the wider structure of the Company, the Partnership and the Investment Undertakings see Note 2: Financial assets a i..
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Taxation The Company is exempt from taxation in Guernsey under the provisions of the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 2008 and is charged an annual exemption fee of 600.
The fee is due to increase to 1,200 with effect from 1 January 2015.
The Company has made an election to, and currently expects to conduct its activities so as to be treated as a partnership for U. S. federal income tax purposes.
Therefore, the Company expects that it generally will not be liable for U. S. federal income taxes.
Instead, each of the Companys Shareholders who are liable to U. S. taxes will take into account its respective share of the Companys items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its U. S. federal income tax liability as if such shareholder had earned such income directly, even if no cash distributions are made to the shareholder.
The Cayman Islands at present impose no taxes on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in value of the Partnership.
There are also currently no taxes imposed in the Cayman Islands by withholding or otherwise on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in respect of its partnership interest nor any taxes on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership in the nature of estate duty, inheritance or capital transfer tax.
Local taxes may apply at the jurisdictional level on profits arising in operating entity investments.
Further withholding taxes may apply on distributions from such operating entity investments.
Based upon the current commitments and investments in Liberty II, Eagle II, Rock Oil, Fieldwood, Castex 2014 and Castex 2005, the future U. S. tax liability on profits is expected to be in the range of 35 to 41.5 per cent.
Fair value IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurement by level.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial assets or financial liabilities are categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement, adjusted if necessary.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3 inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Companys only financial instrument carried at fair value is its investment in the Partnership which has been classified within Level 3 as it has unobservable inputs and is not traded.
Amounts classified under Level 3 for the year ended 31 December 2014 and period ended 31 December 2013 are $1,234 million and $1,130 million, respectively.
The fair value of all other financial instruments approximates their carrying value.
Transfers during the period There have been no transfers between levels during the year ended 31 December 2014 and period ended 31 December 2013.
Any transfers between the levels will be accounted for on the last day of each financial period.
Due to the nature of the investments, they are always expected to be classified under Level 3.. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 6.
Fair value continued Valuation methodology and process The Partnerships investments are valued using the techniques described in the Companys valuation policy.
The value of the Companys investment in the Partnership is based on the value of the Companys limited partner capital account within the Partnership, adjusted if necessary.
This is based on the components within the Partnership, principally the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and U. S. treasury bills held.
Any fluctuation in the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and U. S. treasury bills held will directly impact on the value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
When valuing the Partnerships investments, the Investment Manager reviews information provided by the underlying investee companies and other business partners and applies IPEV methodologies, to estimate a fair value as at the date of the statement of financial position.
Initially, acquisitions are valued at price of recent investment.
Subsequently, and as appropriate, the Investment Manager values the investments on a quarterly basis using common industry valuation techniques, including comparable public market valuation, comparable merger and acquisition transaction valuation, and discounted cash flow valuation.
For early stage private investments, Riverstones investment due diligence process includes assumptions about short-term financial results in determining the appropriate purchase price for the investment.
The techniques used in determining the fair value of the Companys investments through the Partnership are selected on an investment by investment basis so as to maximise the use of market based observable inputs.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, Eagle II, Liberty II, Rock Oil, CNOR, Castex 2014, Origo, Sierra and Castex 2005 are valued at price of recent investment, CIOC is valued at 1.5x price of investment and Fieldwood is valued at 1.4x price of investment.

The Board reviews and considers the fair value of the Partnerships investments arrived at by the Investment Manager before incorporating into the fair value of the Partnership.
The variety of valuation bases adopted, quality of management information provided by the underlying investee companies and the lack of liquid markets for the investments mean that there are inherent difficulties in determining the fair value of these investments that cannot be eliminated.
Therefore the amounts realised on the sale of investments may differ from the fair values reflected in these Financial Statements and the differences may be significant.
The Board approves the valuations performed by the Investment Manager and monitors the range of reasonably possible changes in significant observable inputs on a regular basis.

Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives The Companys investing activities, through its investment in the Partnership, intentionally expose it to various types of risks that are associated with the underlying investee companies of the Partnership.
The Company makes the investment in order to generate returns in accordance with its investment policy and objectives.
The most important types of financial risks to which the Company is exposed are market risk including price, interest rate and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the determination of the Companys risk management and sets policy to manage that risk at an acceptable level to achieve those objectives.
The policy and process for measuring and mitigating each of the main risks are described below.
The Investment Manager and the Administrator provide advice to the Company which allows it to monitor and manage financial risks relating to its operations through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
The Investment Manager and the Administrator report to the Board on a quarterly basis.

The capital structure of the Company consists of issued share capital and retained earnings, as stated in the Statement of Financial Position on page 44.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may buy back shares or issue new shares.
There are no external capital requirements imposed on the Company.
During the year and period ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, respectively, the Company had no borrowings other than trade and other payables.
The Company had sufficient cash and cash equivalents to pay these as they fell due.
The Companys investment policy is set out on pages 20 to 22 of the Annual Report.. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 15.
Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk includes price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Price risk The underlying investments held by the Partnership present a potential risk of loss of capital to the Partnership and hence to the Company.
The Company invests through the Partnership.
Price risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of underlying financial investments held by the Partnership.
The Partnership is exposed to a variety of risks which may have an impact on the carrying value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
The Partnerships risk factors are set out in a i to a iii below.
i Not actively traded The Partnerships investments are not traded in an active market but are indirectly exposed to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investments held see Note 7.
The underlying investments of the Partnership vary as to industry sub-sector, geographic distribution of operations and size, all of which may impact the susceptibility of their valuation to uncertainty.
This risk is managed by an investment strategy that diversifies the investments in terms of geography, financing stage or industry and through careful selection of investments within the specified limits of the investment policy.
The investments are monitored on a regular basis by the Investment Manager.
ii Concentration Concentration in an investment portfolio can have opposing effects on the credit risk of a portfolio.
A low number of investments in a portfolio, or high concentration, reduces risk due to better knowledge and information whilst a higher portfolio concentration in a certain sector of: industry, geographic distribution of operations or size increases sector concentration and the risk of the portfolio.
Conversely a high number of investments and lower concentration can reduce the credit risk of the portfolio but may limit availability of resources and flexibility.
The Company, through the Partnership, intends to invest in the global energy sector, with a particular focus on businesses that engage in oil and gas exploration and production and midstream investments in that sector.
This means that the Company will be exposed to the concentration risk of only making investments in the global energy sector, which concentration risk may further relate to sub-sector, geography, and the relative size of an investment or other factors.
Whilst the Company is subject to the investment and diversification restrictions in its investment policy, within those limits, material concentrations of investments may still arise.
The Board and the Investment Manager monitor the concentration of the investment in the Partnership on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with the investment policy as set out on pages 20 to 22 of the Annual Report.
iii Liquidity The Companys underlying investments through the Partnership are dynamic in nature.
The Partnership will maintain flexibility in funding by keeping sufficient liquidity in cash and cash equivalents which may be invested on a temporary basis in line with the cash management policy as agreed by the Board from time to time.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, respectively, $830 million or 66.8 per cent.
of the Partnerships financial assets were money market fixed deposits, U. S. treasury bills and cash balances held on deposit with several, A or higher rated, banks.
All of these assets have maturities of less than one year.
b Foreign currency risk The Company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to the payment of some expenses in Pounds Sterling.
Consequently, the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U. S. Dollar.
The following tables sets out, in U. S. Dollars, the Companys total exposure to foreign currency risk and the net exposure to foreign currencies of the monetary assets and liabilities: As at 31 December 2014 $ Total ASSETS: $000 $000 $000 Non-current assets Investment in the Partnership 1,234,296 1,234,296 Total non-current assets 1,234,296 1,234,296 Current assets Trade and other receivables 539 7 546 Cash and cash equivalents 2,376 3,350 5,726 Total current assets 2,915 3,357 6,272 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 335 211 546 Total current liabilities 335 211 546 Total net assets 1,236,876 3,146 1,240,022 As at 31 December 2013 $ Total ASSETS: $000 $000 $000 Non-current assets Investment in the Partnership 1,130,051 1,130,051 Total non-current assets 1,130,051 1,130,051 Current assets Trade and other receivables 547 6 553 Cash and cash equivalents 4,319 7,486 11,805 Total current assets 4,866 7,492 12,358 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 150 982 1,132 Total current liabilities 150 982 1,132 Total net assets 1,134,767 6,510 1,141,277 The amounts previously due to affiliates as detailed in Note 11 have been excluded from this analysis as they are not financial instruments.
The Directors do not consider that the foreign currency exchange risk at the balance sheet date is significant or material and therefore sensitivity analysis for the foreign currency risk has not been provided.. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 15.
Financial risk management continued c Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to interest rate risk relates to the Companys cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is subject to risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates.
As at the date of the statement of financial position the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held on interest bearing fixed deposit accounts.
The Company has no other interest-bearing assets or liabilities as at the reporting date.
As a consequence, the Company is only exposed to variable market interest rate risk.
Management does not expect any significant change in interest rates that would have a material impact on the financial performance of the Company in the near future, therefore sensitivity analysis for the interest rate risk has not been provided.
31 December 31 December 2014 2013 $000 $000 Fixed rate Cash and cash equivalents 3,350 7,486 Non-interest bearing Cash and cash equivalents 2,376 4,319 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management and through the preparation of budgets and cash flow forecasts maintains sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
The carrying value of the investment in the Partnership as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 was $1,234 million and $1,130 million, respectively.
Financial assets mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents and investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Companys risk on liquid funds is reduced because it can only deposit monies with institutions with a minimum credit rating of single A.
The Company mitigates its credit risk exposure on its investment at fair value through profit or loss by the exercise of due diligence on the counterparties of the Partnership, its General Partner and the Investment Manager.
The investment risk is managed by an investment strategy that diversifies the investments in terms of financing stage, industry or time.
The investment objectives, policy and restrictions of the Company are set out on pages 20 to 22 of the Annual Report.
For so long as the Ordinary Shares are listed on the Official List, no material change may be made to the Companys investment policy other than with the prior approval of both the Shareholders and a majority of the independent directors of the Company, and otherwise in accordance with the Listing Rules.
