Overview | Strategy | Performance | Governance | Financial statements The Directors regard the adjustments on the previous table necessary to give a fair picture of the underlying results of the Group for the year.
The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the effective value of the annual share award in order better to match the underlying staff costs in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments Note 8 are amortisation of intangible assets excluding software 2.6m 2013: 2.1m, impairment of available-for-sale investment 0.6m 2013: nil, share-based payment adjustment 2.9m credit 2013: 2.5m credit, restructuring costs of 0.9m 2013: 5.2m, profit on disposals of 2.0m 2013: loss of 0.3m and acquisition related costs of 16.6m 2013: nil.

Goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
In most cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation and these have been separately assessed and tested.
A segment-level summary of the allocation of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets is presented below: Property and Transaction Facilities Investment Advisory Consultancy Management Management Total 2014 m m m m m United Kingdom 25.7 9.3 4.9 5.4 45.3 Continental Europe 30.4 4.7 35.1 Asia Pacific 10.8 4.1 27.8 42.7 United States 107.1 107.1 Total goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 174.0 13.4 37.4 5.4 230.2 Property and Transaction Facilities Investment Advisory Consultancy Management Management Total 2013 m m m m m United Kingdom 25.7 9.3 4.9 4.0 43.9 Continental Europe 31.7 5.3 37.0 Asia Pacific 10.6 4.0 28.0 42.6 United States 14.4 14.4 Total goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 82.4 13.3 38.2 4.0 137.9 15.1 Method of impairment testing All recoverable amounts were determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a terminal value.
There was no impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets arising from the annual impairment tests conducted 2013: nil.
15.2 Assumptions a Market conditions In general, the models used assume that the property markets in which the Group operates which drive its revenue growth will remain stable.
b Discount rate The discount rate applied to cash flows of each CGU is based on the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
WACC is the average cost of sources of financing debt and equity, each of which is weighted by its respective use.
Key inputs to the WACC calculation are the risk-free rate, the equity market risk premium the return that Savills shares provide over the risk-free rate, beta reflecting the risk of the Group relative to the market as a whole and the Groups borrowing rates.
Group WACC was adjusted for risk relative to the country in which the assets were located.
The risk-adjusted discount range of rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate range Discount rate range United Kingdom 9.8% 10.9% Continental Europe 9.8% 10.9% Asia Pacific 9.5% 14.4% 9.3% 21.0% United States 9.8% 10.9% c Long-term growth rate To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a terminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates.
The rates are based on the long-term growth rate in the countries in which the Group operates.
The long-term growth rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2014 2013 Long-term growth Long-term growth rate range rate range United Kingdom 2.0% 2.0% Continental Europe 1.0% 2.5% 1.7% 2.5% Asia Pacific 1.5% 5.0% 1.5% 5.3% United States 1.9% 1.9% 104 Savills plc Report and Accounts 2014
