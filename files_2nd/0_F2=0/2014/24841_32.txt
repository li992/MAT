Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 1.
Reporting Entity HICL Infrastructure Company Limited the Company is a company domiciled in Guernsey, Channel Islands, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 March 2014 comprise the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, together referred to as the Consolidated Group see Note 20.
As a result of changes in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS which have been implemented in these financial statements, there has been a significant change in the way the Company presents its consolidated financial statements.
The Company has early adopted IFRS 10, 11 and 12 as well as early adopted Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
These amendments require that entities categorised as Investment Entities exclude certain investments from consolidation.
The impact of this amendment is described in more detail in Note 2 b.
These changes have resulted in a number of entities that were previously consolidated into the financial statements not being consolidated in these financial statements and in the opinion of the Directors this presents the financial statements in a more consistent manner with the objectives and commercial substance of the Consolidated Groups investments.
The Consolidated Group invests in infrastructure projects in the UK, Canada and Europe.
Of the Consolidated Groups portfolio of 93 investments at 31 March 2014, all have been treated as investments, including 29 entities which would have been consolidated prior to the changes to IFRS 10 for Investment Entities as described in more detail in Note 2.
In accordance with section 244 5 of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008, as the Directors have prepared consolidated financial statements for the period, they have not prepared individual statements for the Company in accordance with section 243 for the period.
Key Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 May 2014.
The consolidated financial statements, which give a true and fair view, have been prepared in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU using the historical cost basis, except that the financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss are stated at their fair values.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in these consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU, requires the Directors and advisers to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Note 3 shows critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.
The Consolidated Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 on pages 16 to 18.
The financial position of the Consolidated Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in Sections 2.6 and 2.7 on pages 19 to 29.
In addition, Notes 1 to 4 of the financial statements include the Consolidated Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Consolidated Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
The financing for these projects is non-recourse to the Consolidated Group.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Consolidated Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors believe that the Consolidated Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2014 69 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 2.
Key Accounting Policies continued a Basis of preparation continued New standards effective for the current year The Consolidated Group has early adopted IFRS 10 and Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 which has had a material impact on the Consolidated Groups financial statements as described in Note 2 b.
The Consolidated Group has early adopted IFRS 11 and 12 which has not had a material impact on the Consolidated Groups financial statements.
The above standards are all effective from 1 January 2014.
As permitted, the Company has early adopted these standards for this financial year.
The Consolidated Group also adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements in other IFRSs, including IFRS 7.
The adoption of IFRS 13 has had no material impact on the fair value of any assets or liabilities.
Standards not yet applied The Consolidated Group anticipate that the adoption of the following new, revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Consolidated Group when they become applicable in future periods: Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities mandatory for year commencing on or after 1 January 2014.
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting mandatory for year commencing on or after 1 January 2014. b Comparatives Comparatives have been restated to reflect the early adoption of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
The impact of adopting the amended Investment Entities standard is that a number of entities consolidated in previous periods are no longer consolidated as explained in Note 2 c and as a result the net assets of the Consolidated Group as at 31 March 2013 have increased by 15.0 million with profit after tax increasing by 25.5 million for the year to 31 March 2013.
It has not been practical to calculate the impact on net assets as at 31 March 2014 and profit after tax for the year to 31 March 2014.
Below is a reconciliation for each of the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated cash flow showing the results as reported originally for 31 March 2013 compared to the restated results for 31 March 2013.
The reconciliation for the Consolidated balance sheet is showing results as reported originally for 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 compared to the restated results for 31 March 2013 and 1 April 2012.

Key Accounting Policies continued c Basis of consolidation In these consolidated financial statements the Company has early adopted IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other entities.
IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB has also issued Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 which requires entities that meet the definition of an investment entity to fair value relevant subsidiaries through the profit or loss rather than consolidate their results for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The Company has chosen to early adopt the Investment Entities amendment.
Under the amendment, those entities that provide investment related services or activities to the Company will continue to be consolidated.
This change in accounting policy means that a number of entities previously consolidated are not consolidated in these financial statements.
This change also aligns the Consolidated Group to the Investment Group as defined for risk management purposes in previous financial statements.
The impact of this change is described in more detail in Note 2 b and comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The consolidated financial statements of the Consolidated Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, except those required to be held at fair value, up to 31 March 2014.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
The Company has control of an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee as defined in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, except those held at fair value, are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line by line basis from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
The Directors note that following its meeting on 29 30 January 2014, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Council IFRIC has proposed that the IASB should clarify the position on accounting for investment entity subsidiaries engaged in investment related activities themselves.
At present it is uncertain as to whether the accounting standard will be amended.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Company has all the typical characteristics of an investment entity and the three essential criteria specific in the standard.
In addition, certain subsidiaries provide specific investment management services and undertake investment activities that require the results of those subsidiaries to be consolidated in the Group financial statements.
The three essential criteria are that the entity must: 1.
Obtain funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing these investors with professional investment management services: 2.
Commit to its investors that its business purpose is to invest its funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and 3.
Measure and evaluate the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
In respect of the first essential criteria, typically an investment entity would have several investors who pool their funds to gain access to investment management services and investment opportunities that they might not have had access to individually.
Investing in PFI PPP P3 infrastructure, as per the Companys investment policy, would be considered an investment that is not generally available to individual investors due to the high capital costs, large barriers to entry and other regulatory issues.
The Company, being listed on the London Stock Exchange main market, obtains funds from a diverse group of external shareholders.
In respect of the second essential criteria, investments are managed in order to achieve desired investment returns and value enhancement opportunities are created where possible.
An investment entity should not hold its investments indefinitely.
Although the Consolidated Group invests in equity interests that have an indefinite life, the underlying PFI PPP P3 contracts have fixed terms and no residual value.
Once the PFI PPP P3 contracts have reached the end of their terms, the investment entities will have no purpose and will be wound up in order to return all capital to the Consolidated Group to provide the full return to investors.
In respect of the third criteria, the Consolidated Group measures and evaluates the performance of all of its investments as one portfolio.
Subsidiaries are consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements when they provide investment management services to the Company or investment activities are undertaken while all other subsidiaries and investments are held at fair value similar to the Investment Basis of accounting previously reported separately to the Companys accounts.
Associates are those entities over which the Company has significant influence as defined in IAS 28 Investments in Associates.
By virtue of the Companys status as an investment fund and the exemption provided by IAS 28.1, investments in such entities are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2014 75 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 2.
Key Accounting Policies continued c Basis of consolidation continued In these consolidated financial statements the Company has early adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
Joint arrangements are those entities over which the Consolidated Group has joint control as defined by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Intra-Consolidated Group receivables, liabilities, revenue and expenses are eliminated in their entirety when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Gains that arise from intraConsolidated Group transactions and that are unrealised from the standpoint of the Consolidated Group on the balance sheet date are eliminated in their entirety.
Unrealised losses on intra-group transactions are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent that the loss does not correspond to an impairment loss.
d Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Groups balance sheet when the Consolidated Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
i Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, except for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Investments in equity and debt securities Investments in the equity and loanstock of entities engaged in infrastructure activities which are not classified as subsidiaries of the Consolidated Group or which are subsidiaries not consolidated in the Consolidated Group are designated at fair value through profit or loss since the Consolidated Group manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.
The initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash flows methodology at the date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants would consider in setting the price of that investment.
After initial recognition, investments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Other Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Consolidated Group holds derivative financial instruments to mitigate their foreign currency risk exposure.
All derivatives are recognised initially at fair value with attributable transaction costs recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Thereafter, derivatives are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement as part of finance costs or finance income.
Fair value is based on price quotations from financial institutions active in the relevant market.
The Consolidated Group does not use hedge accounting.
iii Fair values The fair values are determined using the income approach, except for derivative financial instruments, which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, regard is had to relevant long-term government bond yields, the specific risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions.
iv Effective interest The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
Key Accounting Policies continued e Share capital and share premium Ordinary and C Shares are classified as equity.
Costs associated with the establishment of the Company or directly attributable to the issue of new shares that would otherwise have been avoided are written-off against the balance of the share premium account.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement.
g Revenue Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated on acquisition or origination date.
Dividends are recognised when the Consolidated Groups rights to receive payment have been established.
Fees and other operating income are recognised when the Consolidated Groups rights to receive payment have been established.
Gains on investments relates solely to the investments held at fair value.
h Income tax Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income, but all such tax is currently recoverable.
i Foreign exchange gains and losses Transactions entered into by the Consolidated Group in a currency other than their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
j Segmental reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker the CODM is of the opinion that the Consolidated Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in infrastructure which is currently predominately in private finance initiatives and public private partnership companies in one geographical area, the United Kingdom.
The financial information used by the CODM to allocate resources and manage the Consolidated Group presents the business as a single segment comprising a homogeneous portfolio.
k Expenses All expenses and the profit share of the General Partner of Infrastructure Investments Limited Partnership are accounted for on an accruals basis refer to Note 16.
The Consolidated Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the consolidated income statement.
l Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when they are paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
For scrip dividends where the Company issues shares with an equal value to the cash dividend amount as an alternative to the cash dividend, a credit to equity is recognised when the shares are issued.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Consolidated Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Consolidated Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
n Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is an Authorised Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations to the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.
Following formal implementation of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD, the Company is taking advantage of the transitional provisions which extend the deadline for authorisation or registration until 22 July 2014.
As the Company is regarded as an Alternative Investment Fund AIF, the Board has taken legal and regulatory advice, and intends to register the Company as a self-managed AIF.
