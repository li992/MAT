As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 27, the Aerospace Division consists of 19 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 13 operations.
Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU.
Goodwill had been allocated to 20 of these individual CGUs 13 in Aerospace and seven in Flexonics.
The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered significant, it is aggregated in the table below.
The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The 2014 goodwill impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2014.
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years.
For some CGUs this is supplemented by forecasts of performance for a further two years.
These forecasts, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 30.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated growth rates.
These growth rates do not exceed independently sourced long-term average growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax rate used to discount for forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.1% 2013 10.5%.
This is based on the Groups weighted average pre-tax cost of capital and is the measurement used by management in assessing investment appraisals.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for all Aerospace CGUs are the forecast build rates for aircraft, forecast gross margins and long-term average forecast growth rates.
Forecast build rates for aircraft are in line with market forecasts and guidance available from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.
Forecast gross margins are set individually by each CGU and reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in continuing efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 3.0% per annum which does not exceed the www.

GooDwill continued long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing and Airbus.
For Thermal, which has been impacted by operational and performance issues following its acquisition in November 2013, projections for the initial forecast period have been expanded a further two years beyond the initial forecast period of three years to reflect the medium-term plan of management to recover the performance of the business.
Beyond this combined five-year period, cash flows are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.0% into perpetuity, less than the industrys 20-year market projections.
Managements base case cash flows were reduced by 28% to reflect further potential risk in performance.
This results in Thermals weighted average recoverable amount exceeding its carrying value by 9m.
A reduction in managements base case cash flows of 44% would result in the recoverable amount reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value.
Factors that could lead to lower cash flows than currently estimated over the initial five-year period include: not meeting customers expectations for quality and on-time delivery performance which would result in additional rework and inspection costs to be incurred: not securing sufficient new business with existing customers: and not introducing sufficient new growth customers.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of AMT, Weston, Jet Products, Connecticut, BWT and Atlas, Bird Bellows, Senior Aerospace Upeca and all other aggregated Aerospace CGUs, with the exception of Composites as noted below, to exceed the recoverable amount of those units and aggregated units, respectively.
As noted in the Strategic Report and the post balance sheet events note see Note 36, following the announcement by Bombardier to suspend activity on its L85 business jet programme, Composites forecast is expected to be adversely impacted.
An impairment review for this CGU was performed following this announcement and the recoverable amount was determined from a value in use calculation.
The calculation used the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent forecasts at the time, as approved by management for the next five years, removing the L85 business jet programme.
Cash flows thereafter were extrapolated based on estimated growth rates that did not exceed independently sourced estimated long-term average growth rates for the aerospace industry.
Different scenarios, where the compound annual sales growth over the initial five-year period ranged from managements base case of 19.4% to 7.6% were considered.
Beyond this combined five-year period, cash flows were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.0%.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 10.1%.
As at 31 December 2014, before impairment testing, goodwill of 9.4m was allocated to Composites within Aerospace.
As a result of the impairment test noted above, an impairment loss of 9.4m was recognised against Composites goodwill, leaving a balance of nil at 31 December 2014.
This impairment loss has been included within trading profit in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for Pathway, GA and Senior Flexonics Upeca are the forecast orders and forecast gross margins.
Forecast orders are based on the orders secured and quote activity at the time of setting the budget, and also reflect past experience with the build-up of orders and quote success rates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in expected efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of Pathway, GA and Senior Flexonics Upeca to exceed its recoverable amount.
Other than as noted for GA, no significant goodwill is associated with CGUs operating in land vehicle markets.
An impairment charge of 9.4m has been recognised in 2014 2013 12.7m.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
There are no other credit or impairment losses for other classes of financial assets.
Further disclosures on credit risk are included in Note 20.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 60 days 2013 57 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.4m 2013 1.0m.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, 15.5m 2013 13.6m is due from the Groups largest customer and 6.0m 2013 5.1m is due from the Groups second largest customer.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

The Group also has two revolving credit facilities.
A committed 60m five-year syndicated multi-currency facility was entered into in November 2014, which amended and restated a facility of the same amount which was entered into during 2011.
As at 31 December 2014, 8m was drawn under the facility.
There were no amounts drawn under the old facility as at 31 December 2013.
A committed $25m single bank 16.1m loans and letter of credit facility was amended in October 2014 and now matures in June 2017.
This facility was reduced from $50m to $25m in October 2013.

com | Senior plc STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Annual Report & Accounts 2014 89 20. financial instRuments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents and forward exchange contract gains.
Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally the Group aims for this ratio to be between 0.5x and 1.5x.
At 31 December 2014 net debt was 0.8x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2013 0.5x.
In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups EBITDA to be in excess of 3.5x.
At 31 December 2014 EBITDA was 16.2x the level of net interest 31 December 2013 15.4x.
Therefore, the Group currently has considerable funding headroom.
The Groups strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 50% to 70%.
Ratios outside this range may still be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances.
The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2014 was 26% 2013 16%.
The increase in 2014 is attributable mainly to the acquisition in the period.
The cash generated by the Group in recent years has led to the gearing ratio being lower than the targeted range.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposures limits is reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign exchange risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, with all other variables held constant such as interest rates.
The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee.
Translation risk The Group derived 84% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, with 62% relating to operations in North America.
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the results of the Groups operations when reported in Pound Sterling.
The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk.
In addition, the majority of assets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars.
In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these assets compared to the Groups earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Groups principal lending covenant the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and economic.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased or decreased 2014 Group operating profit by 9.6m 7.2m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement and would have increased or decreased net equity by 31.5m 17.4m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling.
The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward basis and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31 December 2014 are immaterial.
The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound Sterling would have decreased or increased net equity by 0.4m and 2.1m, respectively.
com | Senior plc 90 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 20. financial instRuments continued Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
In 2014 the Group increased its share of debt at variable interest rates by refinancing at their stated maturity long-term debt with funds borrowed under its revolving credit facility.
As at year end 2014 the percentage of debt at fixed interest was 75% 2013 100%.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
If variable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups net profit would have increased or decreased by nil.
Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups borrowings by 1.5m.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has remained broadly consistent with the prior period due to the high proportion of fixed debt.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Further details on determining the recoverability of trade receivables is provided in Note 18.
The Group is guarantor under the lease of one building in the UK, which arose on the disposal of a former Group-owned subsidiary in 2001. Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Groups long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 30, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed borrowing facilities.
It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 15.7m 2013 22.0m of such losses.
Due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining tax losses 2.7m 2013 3.1m that will expire within nine years.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 15.9m 2013 11.2m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of this difference because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will notreverse in the foreseeable future.
In addition, at the balance sheet date, the Group has deductible temporary differences, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, inrespect of share-based payments of 1.0m 2013 1.0m, and accelerated book depreciation of nil 2013 10.6m.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these differences due to the unpredictability of both the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and of the future profit streams in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has 5.0m 2013 5.0m of surplus ACT previously written off, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is unlikely to be recovered in the foreseeable future due to the UK earnings profile.
The Group also has 15.9m 2013 15.7m ofunused capital losses, as reduced by gains rolled over, available for offset against future capital gains for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as no such capital gains are anticipated to arise in the foreseeable future.

31. acquisitions Thermal Engineering Limited As noted in the Annual Report & Accounts 2013, on 29 November 2013 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Thermal Engineering Ltd and its parent company Thermal Engineering Holding Ltd collectively Thermal.
On reviewing the financial exposures during 2014, the fair value of financial liabilities increased by 1.3m resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill of 1.3m.
On 8 April 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of UPECA Technologies Sdn.
and its 100%-owned subsidiaries UPECA Flowtech Sdn.
UPECA Engineering Tianjin Co. Ltd, UPECA Valve Automation Sdn.
together with its 75%-owned subsidiary UPECA Aerotech Sdn.
The Group also subsequently acquired the remaining 25% minority interest in UPECA Aerotech Sdn.
Upeca is located in Selangor, Malaysia and Tianjin, China and manufactures high-precision engineered components serving the aerospace and energy sectors.
Upecas capabilities are highly complementary to Seniors existing portfolio, strengthening the Groups aerospace and energy market presence in the increasingly important South East Asian region.
The consideration was 59.1m plus the assumption of 15.3m of net debt and the acquisition was funded by the Groups existing debt facilities.
com | Senior plc 98 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 31. acquisitions continued Set out below is a provisional summary of the net assets acquired: Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: m Identifiable intangible assets 17.8 Property, plant and equipment and computer software 15.1 Inventories 4.7 Financial assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents 7.5 Cash and cash equivalents 4.9 Financial liabilities excluding bank overdraft and other borrowings 5.8 Bank overdraft and other borrowings 20.2 Deferred tax liability 1.4 Net assets acquired 22.6 Goodwill 36.5 Total consideration 59.1 Consideration satisfied by: Cash paid 59.1 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 59.1 Add: overdraft net of cash and cash equivalents acquired 1.0 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 60.1 The goodwill of 36.5m represents the premium paid in anticipation of future profitability from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the expectation that the Group will be able to leverage its wider market access and strong financial position to generate sustainable financial growth beyond what Upeca would have potentially achieved as a stand-alone company.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate mainly to customer contracts and relationships, the fair value of which is dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over five years.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a provisional fair value of 6.8m and a gross contractual value of 6.8m, all of which is currently expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.6m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is provisional pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
Upeca contributed 26.8m of external revenue and 4.1m to the Groups operating profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2014, continuing Group revenue for the 12 months ended 31 December 2014 would have been 828.8m and continuing Group operating profit would have been 90.9m.

a 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan Equity-Settled Long-Term Incentive Plans On 21 March 2014 982,115 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions being met.
Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance period of at least 4% per annum above RPI.
The other half of the awards begin to vest if the Groups TSR falls in the top half of a comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting levels increase with higher performance.
The awards are settled by delivering shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions is 283.10p, which is essentially the share price at the date of grant of 301.60p per share less an allowance for dividends foregone over the three-year vesting period.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions is 139.80p per share reflecting an adjustment of 49% to the fair value of the awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
This model incorporates a technique called bootstrapping, which models the impact of the TSR condition.
The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 297.90p, expected volatility of 30.0% per annum, net dividend yield of 1.7% per annum, and the performance conditions as noted above.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

These are subject to the same general terms and conditions as the above equity-settled awards, however, on vesting the holder is entitled to receive an amount equal to the market value of the shares in relation to which the phantom award vests.
On 21 March 2014, 4,047 notional shares subject to the phantom awards were awarded under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
20,674 phantom awards were forfeited during the year.

There are no performance criteria for this award.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year is 283.10p per share, which is essentially the share price at the date of grant of 301.60p per share less an allowance for dividends foregone over the three-year deferral period.

RetiRement benefit scHemes The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, North America and Europe.
These include both defined contribution arrangements and defined benefit arrangements.
The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company.
This plan was closed to future accrual at the end of 6 April 2014.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2013 and, for the purposes of accounting under IAS 19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2014.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from October 2009.
The second plan was closed to future participants from September 2013, and the Executive section was also closed to future accruals from December 2013.
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements.
In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting actuaries using the Projected Unit Method.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US.
Separate disclosure is provided for these arrangements.
The bulk of the pension obligations relate to the UK Plan and we provide more detail on that arrangement below.
com | Senior plc STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Annual Report & Accounts 2014 103 35.
RetiRement benefit scHemes continued For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan.
Currently there are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors who have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other Director are viewed as independent.
The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a horizonbased approach.
Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 17 years the horizon period are met by investment in low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds.
Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets which are expected to deliver a higher return than bonds in the longer term.
Benefits are expected to be paid over the next 60 to 70 years.
The UK plans average duration is around 17 years.
In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification between different asset classes.
The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformances of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the UK defined benefit plan over a period agreed with the Trustees.
To the extent that actual experience is different to that assumed the funding position will be better or worse than anticipated.
As such, the contributions required by the Group could vary in the future.
The two key risks faced by pension schemes are longevity risk i. e. members living longer than expected and investment risk i. e. the schemes assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities.
The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the UK plan to fund the plan deficit over an eight-year period from April 2013 to March 2021.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2015 to the UK plan is 8.7m 8.1m of which is to fund the past service deficit and 0.6m in respect of administrative expenses and to the US funded plans is nil.
a Defined contribution schemes The Group has a number of different defined contribution and government-sponsored arrangements in place in the countries in which it operates.
None of these are individually material to the Group and the aggregate cost of such schemes for the period was 7.4m 2013 6.2m.

For the UK plan, the estimated impact on the plan deficit at 31 December 2014 for changes in assumptions is as follows: Increase in plan deficit m 0.5% decrease in the discount rate 22.0 One-year increase in life expectancy 8.0 0.5% increase in inflation 13.0 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the plan.
h Other post-retirement liabilities This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan 3.3m 2013 3.2m, unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the USA 0.4m 2013 0.3m and provision for post-retirement payments in France of 2.0m 2013 2.2m.
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method using a discount rate of 3.9%.
As at 31 December 2014 no more participants were eligible for medical benefits under the plan.
The German plan has been subject to formal actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 2.2%: salary growth 0.0%: and inflation 2.0%.
In France, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement.
Hence, it is not subject to discounting to the same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities.
