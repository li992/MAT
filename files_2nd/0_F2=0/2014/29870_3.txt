STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL SUMMARY 2013-2014 This is the first time that the Annual Report has been written under the newly introduced narrative reporting framework in the UK, which includes a new requirement to provide a Strategic Report.
The Strategic Report is designed to replace and enhance reporting previously included within the Business Review section of the Directors Report.
The aim of the Strategic Report is to provide shareholders with the ability to assess how the Directors have performed in their duty to promote the success of the Company for shareholders collective benefit by bringing together into one place all the information about the Companys strategy, the risks it faces, how it is performing and the direction in which it is heading.
