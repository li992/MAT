Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer-term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 170,376,000 2013: 183,653,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk On 28 November 2013, the Group increased and extended its syndicated revolving credit facility with its existing core group of five banks and with its terms mainly unchanged.
The facility was increased to 360m from 260m and the term extended to November 2018 from October 2016.
This facility is the main source of long-term funding for the Group.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 135 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 135 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Company Accounts 26 Financial instruments continued The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 505,000 2013: 464,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a 207,000 2013: 186,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 29 March 2014.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 1,742,000 at 29 March 2014 2013: 1,703,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 92,000 2013: 2,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 1,650,000 2013: 1,701,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 32,789,000 2013: 48,020,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, a loan note and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 109,027,000 at 29 March 2014 2013: 160,013,000.
All bank loans and the loan note bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
2014 2013 000 000 Analysis of interest bearing financial liabilities Sterling denominated bank loans 97,000 109,000 US Dollar denominated bank loans 34,540 Swiss Franc denominated bank loans 7,891 13,958 Total bank loans 104,891 157,498 Overdrafts principally Sterling and US Dollar denominated 1,405 Sterling denominated loan note 2,731 2,515 Total interest bearing financial liabilities 109,027 160,013 For the year ended 29 March 2014 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit before tax by 1,520,000 2013: 1,281,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of the contractual contingent purchase consideration due after one year is 6,173,000 2013: 7,030,000 and is due between one and two years.
No amounts are payable after more than two years 2013: 12,626,000.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,569,000 2013: 1,216,000 due between one and two years, 1,308,000 2013: 1,079,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 2,000 2013: 10,000 due after more than five years.
Deferred government grant income due after more than one year includes 28,000 2013: 16,000 due between one and two years, 47,000 2013: 47,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 610,000 2013: 625,000 due after more than five years.
The Groups bank loans are revolving credit facilities and the amount and timing of future payments and drawdowns is unknown.
It is therefore not possible to calculate the interest arising on these loans and we have therefore not disclosed the maturity of the gross cash flows including interest in relation to these liabilities.
136 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 136 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year 360m revolving credit facility, which expires in November 2018.
The Group has an additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facility of 15,060,000, which matures in March 2015.
This facility was undrawn at 29 March 2014.
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
UK companies have cross-guaranteed 22,122,000 2013: 17,025,000 of overdraft facilities of which 1,100,000 2013: nil was drawn.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 29 March 2014 and 30 March 2013 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value of floating and fixed rate borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months: Average exchange rate Foreign currency Contract value Fair value 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward contracts not in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.65 1.56 5,186 3,841 3,139 2,237 15 53 Euros 1.21 1.16 1,951 783 1,613 673 15 Other currencies 515 486 25 2 5,267 3,396 10 40 Forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.60 1.59 7,993 8,051 4,982 5,069 173 243 Euros 1.18 1.22 10,334 9,651 8,724 7,878 174 294 Czech Koruna 32.82 30.15 109,844 93,595 3,347 3,105 27 67 Other currencies 1,028 155 19 30 11,387 9,687 339 500 Total forward contracts US Dollars 1.62 1.58 13,179 11,532 8,121 7,306 187 296 Euros 1.19 1.22 12,285 10,434 10,337 8,551 174 279 Czech Koruna 32.82 30.15 109,844 93,595 3,347 3,105 27 67 Other currencies 1,543 331 5 32 16,654 13,083 329 540 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 147 223 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure 182 317 329 540 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 137 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 137 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Company Accounts 26 Financial instruments continued The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a 496,000 2013: 256,000 asset and 167,000 2013: 796,000 liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Any movements in the fair values of the contracts are recognised in equity until the hedge transaction occurs, when gains losses are recycled to finance income or finance expense.

With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 142,678 151,290 32,433 49,130 Euro 64,525 66,232 14,818 14,731 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Profit 4,633 4,263 1,899 1,708 Other equity 10,022 8,595 4,519 4,720 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Groups profits are earned in these currencies.
