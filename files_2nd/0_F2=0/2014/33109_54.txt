Retirement benefit schemes Background The Group has four defined benefit schemes in the UK, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the SEGRO scheme, the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme and two additional schemes following the acquisition of Brixton Ltd, the Brixton plc Pension Plan the Brixton scheme and the JSaville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme the JSG scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for which 1.3 million has been recognised as an expense 2013: 1.3 million.
Defined benefit pension provision is through trust-based schemes.
These arrangements are now closed to new entrants and, with the exception of the SEGRO Pension Scheme, future accrual of benefits.
In these arrangements, the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards.
The Trustee board of each pension scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the fund and its members and also takes into consideration the interests of the employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have member representation, with the other Trustees being company appointed.
Each Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the relevant fund, although, in respect of the SEGRO Pension Scheme, the Company must be consulted on this and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the funding position is established.
The Company and Trustee boards are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this.
The contributions may need to incorporate deficit recovery contributions if a deficit position is determined through the valuation.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability ofcontributions by the employer.
138 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 21.
Retirement benefit schemes continued In general, any surplus after benefits have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
We operate four defined benefit schemes and the SEGRO Pension Scheme is by far the largest.
The last triennial valuation of the SEGRO Pension Scheme was performed as at 31 March 2013.
Following the valuation, the Company agreed a schedule of future payments with the Trustees, comprising a lump sum payment of 2.73 million in March 2014 and annual payments of 5.93 million payable in equal monthly instalments for a period of four years from 1 April 2014.
The IAS 19 deficit of this scheme as at 31 December 2014 is 12.3 million 2013: 8.0 million.
Management consider that, were a pension asset to arise in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable in line with the rules of the scheme.
Valuation of the other schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations: 5 April 2013 for the Bilton scheme, 31 December 2011 for the Brixton scheme and 30 June 2013 for the JSG scheme and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2014.
Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to all retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the relevant benefit schemes which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
Over 70 per cent of the schemes assets are held in bonds and gilts which are a broad hedge for the schemes liabilities including some which are index-linked.
It is the intention of each scheme to move to less risky, gilt and bond assets as the scheme matures to match the liabilities of the scheme.
