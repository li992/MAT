FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 102 COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Segment analysis The Group is a world leading provider of professional information solutions serving four market segments: scientific, Technical & Medical, providing information and tools to help its customers improve scientific and healthcare outcomes: Risk & Business Information, providing data, analytics and insight that enables customers to evaluate and manage risk and develop market intelligence: Legal, providing legal, tax and regulatory news and business information to legal, corporate, government, accounting and academic markets: and Exhibitions, organising exhibitions and conferences.
The Groups reported segments are based on the internal reporting structure and financial information provided to the Boards.
During 2014, Risk Solutions and Business Information have been combined into one business area, having previously operated separately.
Accordingly, they are now presented as a single operating segment.
Comparative gures have been presented as if the businesses had operated on a combined basis in the prior year.
Following a review of activities, assets and costs across the business, the Group introduced a new method for the allocation of corporate and shared costs from 1 January 2014.
Previously unallocated items and costs relating to shared activities and resources have been attributed to the business segments on the basis of usage and benets derived.
This new allocation reects an increased level of shared resources and capitalised costs.
Comparative adjusted operating profit and operating profit gures have been restated as if these allocation methods had operated in the prior year.
This reects the presentation of financial information provided to the Boards.
Adjusted operating profit is the key segmental profit measure used by the Group in assessing performance.
Adjusted operating profit is reconciled to operating profit in note 10.
