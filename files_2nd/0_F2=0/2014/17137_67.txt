Financial instruments The directors believe that, owing to the nature of the Groups non-derivative financial instruments, the carrying value equates to the fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13 of the Groups financial instruments carried at fair value was as follows: 30 December 2014 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets liabilities held at fair value Forward currency contracts 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Contingent consideration 0.5 0.5 Ante post bet liabilities 11.0 11.0 11.6 11.6 Total 0.2 11.0 11.2 0.2 12.1 12.3 Ante post bet liabilities are valued using methods and inputs that are not based upon observable market data and all fair value movements on the balance are recognised in revenue in the income statement.
There are no reasonably possible changes to assumptions or inputs that would lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results.
The principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets.
Forward currency contracts are classified as level 2 in the hierarchy, as their value is determined using inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Changes in their fair value are recorded in the income statement, except in cases where the hedging arrangement qualifies for hedge accounting.
As at 30 December 2014, the Group had forward contracts outstanding for a total of 80.0 million Israeli Shekels at an average GBP:ILS exchange rate of 1:5.96 with final expiry in December 2015 and forward contracts for a total of 17.4 million Philippine Pesos at an average GBP:PHP exchange rate of 1:71.9 with final expiry in January 2015, which combined are valued as a liability of 0.2m.
Contingent consideration liabilities are classified as level 3 in the hierarchy.
These liabilities represented the present value of the cash outflows under earn-out agreements that would result from acquired businesses performing in line with managements current estimates.
The key inputs into the fair value estimation included the forecast performance of the underlying business and the discount rate applied in deriving a present value from those forecasts.
The contingent consideration was settled in the period.
A reconciliation of movements on level 3 instruments is provided in the table below.
