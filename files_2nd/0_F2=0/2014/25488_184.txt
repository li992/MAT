The majority of the schemes are defi ned contribution schemes with the exception of two schemes in the UK, being the Guinness Mahon Pension Fund scheme GM scheme and the Investec Asset Management Pension scheme IAM scheme.
Both schemes are fi final salary pension plans with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans are is subject to UK regulations, which require the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the plan.
The role of the trustees is to ensure that the schemes are administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members andbenefi ciaries.
The trustees are solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The schemes are closed to new members and the accrual of service ceased on 31 March 2002.
The schemes have been valued at 31 March 2014 by qualifi ed independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19.
Therewere no unpaid contributions in relation to the defi ned contribution schemes outstanding at the year end.
The major assumptions used were: Discount rate 4.40% 4.40% Rate of increase in salaries 3.40% 3.40% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 1.80% 3.40% 1.80% 3.30% Infl ation RPI 3.40% 3.30% Infl ation CPI 2.40% 2.40% Demographic assumptions One of the most signifi cant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
Thespecifi c mortality rates used are based on the PCMA00 and PCFA00 base tables with allowance for future improvements in line with the medium cohort projection subject to a 1%underpin.
Thelife expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: Years Years Male aged 65 87.7 87.6 Female aged 65 89.7 89.6 01 Male aged 45 89.6 89.5 Female aged 45 91.1 91.0 Sensitivity analysis of assumptions The sensitivities are only presented for the GM scheme as the equivalent increases or decreases in assumptions for the IAM scheme do not have a material impact.
If the discount rate is 0.25% higher the defi ned benefi t obligations would decrease by 4.9million, or increase by 5.2million if the discount rate was 0.25% lower.
If the expected increase in salaries increased by 0.25% the defi ned benefi t obligations would increase by 0.3million, or decrease by 0.3million if the increase in salaries decreased by 0.25%.
If the rate of increase in pensions on payment increased by 0.25% the defi ned benefi t obligations would increase by 1.8million, or decrease by 1.7million if the rate of increase decreased by 0.25%.

Pension commitments continued If the deferred revaluation assumption was 0.25% higher the scheme liabilities would increase by 1.0million, or decrease by 1.0million if the deferred revaluation assumption decreased by 0.25%.
If the expected mortality assumptions increased by one year for both men and women, the defi ned benefi t obligations would increase by 3.7million, or decrease by 2.9million if the life expectancy were to decrease by one year.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the relevant assumption would occur in isolation, holding other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defi ned benefi t obligation as it isunlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation has been calculated using the same methodology that applied in calculating the defi ned benefi t obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Risk exposures A description of the risks which the pension schemes expose Investec can be found in the Risk Management report on page 82 in volume two.
The group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the defi ned benefi t plans.
If the contributions currently agreed are insuffi cient to pay the benefi ts due, the group will need to make further contributions to the plans.
The plan assets held in the schemes were: At 31 March 000 2014 2013 GM scheme Equities 18522 Gilts 132799 116517 Cash 2634 2464 Total market value of assets 135433 137503 IAM scheme Equities 13872 Gilts 2619 Managed funds 22280 Cash 34 5 453 Total market value of assets 22314 21 944 There are no assets which are unquoted.
None of the group's own assets or properties occupied or used by the group held within the assets of the scheme.
The investment strategy in place for the GM scheme is to switch to gilts over the period to 31 March 2021.
At 31 March 2014, 01 the allocation of the GM scheme's invested assets was 100% to gilts and cash.
This is ahead of the investment strategy.
Thehigher allocation is due to additional switches from equities to gilts during the fi first and third quarter of 2013 under the agreed outperformance trigger mechanism.
The investment strategy is set out in the GM scheme's Statement of Investment Principles, which the Trustees update as its policy evolves.
The Trustee's current investment strategy is to strike a balance between maximising the returns on the scheme's assets and minimising the risks associate with lower than expectedreturns.
