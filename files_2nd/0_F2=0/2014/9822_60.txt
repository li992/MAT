The corresponding balance of 120.0 million 2013: nil held in this bank account is included within cash and cash equivalents.
The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisations debt service obligations should there ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments.
As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash.
Included within cash at bank and in hand is an amount of 1.4 million 2013: 2.6 million relating to a letter of credit with Royal Sun Alliance Insurance, an amount of 1.0 million 2013: 0.5 million relating to a letter of credit with Aviva, and an amount of 8.2 million 2013: 8.5 million relating to collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
These amounts are also considered to be restricted cash.
In addition, any other cash held in connection with the securitised business is governed by certain restrictions under the covenants associated with the securitisation note 19.
Net debt does not include other financial liabilities such as trade and other payables.
