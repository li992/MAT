Please refer to note 23 Fair value methodology for further information on the fair value measurement and valuation techniques of investment property.
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2014 was 8,917 million 2013: 9,447 million.
Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 54 b i.
23 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and for fair value disclosures.
It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows: Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are investment properties, certain private equity investments and private placements.

17.4% of assets and 2.4% of liabilities measured at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2. b Changes to valuation techniques There were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the 2013 annual consolidated financial statements, other than those noted below.
c Comparison of the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, excluding those classified as held for sale.
These amounts may differ where the asset or liability is carried on a measurement basis other than fair value, e. g. amortised cost.

Non-recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those fair value measurements that other IFRSs permit or require in particular circumstances.
Investments classified as Level 2 Please see note 23 a for a description of typical Level 2 inputs.
Fixed income assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using an independent pricing service.
These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis.
Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes.
Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied.
When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.
Other Level 2 investments, including Unit Trusts, are valued using net assets values which are deemed to be observable market inputs.
e Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels of the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of the reporting period.
Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 For the year ended 31 December 2014, transfers of financial assets from fair value hierarchy Level 1 to Level 2 amounted to 3.4 billion.
These arose primarily in the UK and Ireland 3.1 billion as a result of the enhanced understanding of pricing vendor methodologies for the fair value hierarchy level classification of certain debt securities.
The remaining 0.3 billion were transferred as a result of a decline in the level of market activity for certain debt securities.
Transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of 0.2 billion followed changes in the level of market activity of certain investments.

Transfers of assets into Level 3 of 3.4 billion included: 1.8 billion of privately placed notes held in the UK Life business.
The discounted cash flow model used to fair value the notes was refined to incorporate asset specific counterparty credit ratings.
Where these inputs have been deemed to be unobservable notes have been classified as Level 3.
1.4 billion of debt securities held in the UK and France and 0.2 billion of loans held in the UK have been transferred into Level 3 either due to the unavailability of significant observable market data or sufficiently significant differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation models.
For the year to 31 December 2014, transfers of financial liabilities between fair value hierarchies included the transfer of 0.3 billion of derivative liabilities in the UK from Level 2 to Level 3 due to the unavailability of observable market inputs.

Included in this balance are net gains of 1,733 million restated 2013: 199 million attributable to those assets and net losses of 227 million restated 2013: gains 22 million attributable to those liabilities still held at the end of the year.
The principal assets classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: Commercial mortgage loans held by our UK Life business amounting to 10.4 billion 2013: 9.9 billion, valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model PCRM.
This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value CRAV for each mortgage.
The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve, taking into account the term dependent gilt yield curve, and global assumption for the liquidity premium.
The mortgage loans have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is deemed to be non-market observable.
The illiquidity premium used in the discount rate ranges between 140 bps to 180 bps.
Equity release and securitised mortgage loans held by our UK life business amounting to 5.9 billion 2013: 4.7 billion comprise: 3.6 billion 2013: 2.6 billion of equity release mortgages held by our UK Life annuity business valued using an internal model which has been refined during 2014 see note 41 b iii for further details.
Inputs to the model include property growth rates, mortality and morbidity assumptions, cost of capital and liquidity premium.
These mortgage loans continue to be classified as Level 3 as these inputs are not deemed to be market observable.
The assumed property growth ranges between 1.4% to 1.7% per annum.
2.3 billion 2013: 2.1 billion of securitised and equity release mortgages are valued using a DCF model.
The inputs include liquidity risk and property risk premium which are deemed unobservable.
The liquidity risk premium used ranges between 140 bps to 180 bps.
Investment property amounting to 8.9 billion 2013: 9.5 billion.
In the UK, investment property is valued at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and using estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced by local qualified staff of the Group or external qualified professional appraisers in the countries concerned.
Investment properties are valued on an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property.
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar property.
These inputs are deemed unobservable.
Structured bond-type and non-standard debt products held by our business in France amounting to 7.4 billion 2013: 7.1 billion and bonds held by our UK business of 1.0 billion 2013: 0.5 billion, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third-party models.
These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the third-party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment, or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2014, the values reported in respect of these products were the lower of counterparty and broker quotes and internally modelled valuations.
Privately placed notes held by our UK Life business of 1.8 billion transferred in during 2014 have been valued by an internal DCF model using discount factors comprising the yield on a sovereign gilt of similar maturity, plus spreads for credit and liquidity risk.
The DCF model used was refined during the year to incorporate asset specific counterparty credit ratings.
Where credit spreads have been derived internally these inputs have been deemed to be unobservable and notes have been classified as Level 3.
Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.0 billion 2013: 1.1 billion, together with external hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK and France amounting to 1.4 billion 2013: 1.1 billion, and property funds amounting to 0.3 billion 2013: 0.5 billion are valued based on external reports received from the fund manager.
Where these valuations are at a date other than balance sheet date, as in the case of some private equity funds, we make adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund managers carried interest.
Level 3 investments including a collateralised loan obligation of 0.4 billion 2013: 0.4 billion and UK non-recourse loans of 0.5 billion 2013: 0.8 billion have been valued using internally developed discounted cash flow models.
Investments including debt securities held by our French business of 0.3 billion 2013: 0.7 billion have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 1.2 billion restated 2013: 1.0 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.

Valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties when available and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 39.3 billion of the Groups Level 3 assets.
For these Level 3 assets, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value by 1.5 billion - 1.6 billion.
Of the 1.2 billion Level 3 assets for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, it is estimated that a 10% change in valuation downwards of these assets would result in a change in fair value of approximately 120 million.
The principal liabilities classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: 0.6 billion 2013: 0.5 billion of securitised mortgage loan notes are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets.
Derivative liabilities of 1.0 billion restated 2013: 0.2 billion comprising of over the counter derivatives such as credit default swaps and inflation swaps.
These swaps are valued using either a Discounted Cash Flow DCF models or other valuation models.
Cash flows within these models may be adjusted based on assumptions reflecting the underlying credit risk and liquidity risk and these assumptions are deemed to be not market observable.
Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 0.5 billion of the Groups Level 3 liabilities.
For these Level 3 liabilities, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value by approximately 30 million.
Of the 1.1 billion Level 3 investments for which sensitivity analysis is not provided it is estimated that a 10% change in valuation downwards of these liabilities would result in a change in fair value of approximately 110 million.
