Retirement benefit obligation WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2014 2013 WHSmith Pension Trust 55 62 United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 55 62 Recognised as: Current liabilities 11 11 Non-current liabilities 44 51 a Defined benefit pension schemes i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust Final Salary Section is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme: it was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
Benefits are based on service and salary at the date of closure or leaving service, with increases currently based on CPI inflation in deferment and RPI inflation in payment.
The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for administration and management of the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the Trust Deed and relevant legislation.
Responsibilities include the investment of funds, the triennial valuation and determining the deficit funding schedule.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed there are 10 Trustee directors of which 3 are appointed by the Sponsor, 4 are member-nominated directors, and 3 are independent.
Trustee directors are appointed for a term of 6 years, and are then eligible for re-appointment.
The WHSmith Pension Trust, has assets valued at 1,087m as at 31 August 2014 managed by third party investment managers.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy where the assets in the investment fund were invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation.
The LDI structure that is in place has a number of inflation and interest rate hedges and equity option agreements, with collateral posted daily to or from the scheme to the relevant counterparty.
The risk of failure of counterparties could expose the scheme to loss.
The scheme's liabilities are also subject to changes in longevity.
The principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements are as follows: Longevity risk Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases in life expectancy leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities.
Interest rate and Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest rates and inflation, with lower interest rates or higher inflation leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities.
As a result of the LDI policy outlined above, these risks are largely hedged.
An Investment Committee of the Trustees to the scheme meets regularly to review the performance of the investment managers and the scheme as a whole.
The Company is represented on this Committee.
Although investment decisions are the responsibility of the Trustee, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension plan risks are managed efficiently and is an active participant of the investment subcommittee.
The risk of failure of counterparties and of the investment manager is monitored regularly by the Committee.
The Trustees have the right to determine the level of contributions and the Company has agreed with the Trustees a deficit funding schedule.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
As at the balance sheet date on 31 August 2014, the latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2012 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The March 2012 deficit was 75m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of approximately 13m per annum subject to indexation over the following seven years was agreed with the Trustee.
During the year ending 31 August 2014, the Group made a contribution of 14m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2013: 12m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18 years.
Since the balance sheet date the Trustees have completed a full actuarial valuation of the WHSmith Pension Trust as at 31 March 2014.
As at 31 March 2014 the deficit was 24m.
A revised deficit funding schedule of approximately 3m per annum with effect from 1 October 2014, for the following nine years, has been agreed with the Trustee.
The expected pension contributions for the year ended 31 August 2015 will be approximately 4m to reflect the higher contribution paid in September 2014 under the previous schedule of contributions.
This valuation has not been reflected in the minimum funding requirement recognised at the balance sheet date.
