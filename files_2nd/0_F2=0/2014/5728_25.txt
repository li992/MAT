Additional Information Definitions of selected financial indicators EBITDA EBITDA represents profit from operations plus depreciation, depletion and amortisation, impairment of assets, loss gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, and foreign exchange loss gain.
EVRAZ presents an EBITDA because it considers EBITDA to be an important supplemental measure of its operating performance and believes that EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the same industry.
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and it should not be considered as an alternative to net profit as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
EVRAZs calculation of EBITDA may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and potential investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.
Some of these limitations include: EBITDA does not reflect the impact of financing or financing costs on EVRAZs operating performance, which can be significant and could further increase if EVRAZ were to incur more debt.
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of income taxes on EVRAZs operating performance.
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of depreciation and amortisation on EVRAZs operating performance.
The assets of EVRAZs businesses which are being depreciated and or amortised will have to be replaced in the future and such depreciation and amortisation expense may approximate the cost of replacement of these assets in the future.
EBITDA, due to the exclusion of these costs, does not reflect EVRAZs future cash requirements for these replacements.
EBITDA also does not reflect the impact of a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment.
