Financial statements Notes to financial statements Year ended 31 March 2014 6.
Exceptional items Exceptional expenditure of 46.7m was incurred during the year which related to additional costs associated with the FCA investigation and the UK customer re-contact exercise.
The FCA financial penalty was finalised at 30.6m which required a 27.7m increase in the provision in FY14.
The fine was paid in February 2014.
During the year, an additional 19.0m provision was made in respect of the customer re-contact exercise.
While the population of customers being re-contacted remained unchanged, with greater visibility of the numbers requesting a review and the value of the reimbursements being made, the cost of the exercise was higher than originally anticipated thus resulting in the increased provision.
The exceptional expenditure in FY13 related to the 14.8m impairment of goodwill in respect of Socit Franaise fide Garantie S. A. together with 10.0m of costs related to the FCA investigation and UK re-organisation, and 0.3m of other costs.
