Mature forestry assets are those plantations that are harvestable, while immature forestry assets have not yet reached that stage of growth.
Timber is harvested according to a rotation plan, once trees reach maturity.
This period ranges from 6.5 to 14.5 years, depending on species, climate and location.
The fair value of forestry assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy see note 30b and this category is consistent with prior years.
The fair value of forestry assets is calculated on the basis of future expected net cash flows arising on the Groups owned forestry assets, discounted based on a pre tax yield on long-term bonds over the last five years.
The following assumptions have a significant impact on the valuation of the Groups forestry assets: The net selling price which is defined as the selling price less the costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading.
The net selling price is based on third party transactions and is influenced by the species, maturity profile and location of timber.
In 2014, the net selling price used ranged from 10 per tonne to 35 per tonne 2013: 10 per tonne to 44 per tonne with a weighted average of 22 per tonne 2013: 21 per tonne.
The conversion factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber, which is dependent on the species, the maturity profile of the timber, the geographic location, climate and a variety of other environmental factors.
The discount rate of 10.6% 2013: 11.4% based on a pre tax yield from long-term government bonds matching the average age of the timber and adjusted for the risks associated with forestry assets.
The valuation of the Groups forestry assets is determined in rand and converted to euro at the closing exchange rate on 31 December of each year.
The reported value of owned forestry assets would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying assumptions: million 2014 Effect of 1 tonne increase in net selling price 12 Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor hectares to tonnes 2 Effect of 1% increase in discount rate 2 Effect of 1% increase in EUR ZAR exchange rate 2 Mondi Group | Integrated report and financial statements 2014
