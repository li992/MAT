c Operational borrowings i The carrying amounts of these borrowings are: 2014 2013 m m Amounts owed to financial institutions Loans 696 1,410 Securitised mortgage loan notes UK lifetime mortgage business 1,372 1,313 Total 2,068 2,723 All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost, except for the loan notes issued in connection with the UK lifetime mortgage business of 1,372 million 2013: 1,313 million.
These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, depending on whether observable market prices are available for the loan note.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
Further details about these notes are given in note 25.
