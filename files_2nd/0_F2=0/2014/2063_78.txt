Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year and estimates of third-party prices.
Prices for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 are calculated using a 12-month average price in line with SEC methodology.
Prices for the year ended 31 December 2014 are calculated using the Groups long-term reference conditions of Brent oil $90 real, used to determine reserves estimates in accordance with SPE-PRMS price assumptions.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs, which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
Reserves for the year ended 31December 2012 and 31 December 2013 are under SEC methodology and reserves for the year ended 31 December 2014 are under SPE-PRMS methodology.
