The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 23% to 21% on 1 April 2014.
Factors that may affect future tax charges At 30 April 2014 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 5,681,000 2013 5,107,000 in respect of taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make suitable taxable revenue profits in excess of deductible expenses in future periods.
The potential deferred tax asset has been calculated using a corporation tax rate of 20% 2013 23%.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

In accordance with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the above tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described on page 40, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
During the year the Companys holding in North Atlantic Drilling was transferred from level 2 unlisted equities quoted on an investment exchange to Level 1 listed equities following the listing of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 39 Notes to the Financial Statements 9 Investments continued Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
The purchases and sales proceeds figures above include transaction costs of 388,000 2013 256,000 and 315,000 2013 303,000 respectively.
Of the realised gains on sales of fixed and current asset investments during the year of 78,357,000 2013 losses of 23,804,000, a net gain of 88,999,000 2013 21,488,000 was included in investment holding gains losses at the previous year end.
40 Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements 9 Investments continued The tables below show a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The gains and losses shown in the tables have all been included in the Income Statement on page 32 within gains losses on investments.
The values of level 3 investments are calculated using valuation techniques based upon the latest dealing prices, stockbroker valuations, net asset values and other information as appropriate.
The Company believes that other reasonably possible alternative valuations for its Level 3 holdings would not be significantly different from those included in the financial statements.

Shareholders funds as reported in the balance sheet has been computed in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26.
A reconciliation of the two sets of figures under these two conventions is given in note 15.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing net asset value per ordinary share from 426.8p to 425.2p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2014 of 370.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 13.0% as against 13.3% on a traditional basis.
At 30 April 2013 the effect would have been to reduce net asset value per ordinary share from 410.2p to 408.1p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2013 of 355.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 13.0% as against 13.5% on a traditional basis.

21 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of derivative financial instruments open at the balance sheet date are shown on pages 49 and 50.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 45 Notes to the Financial Statements 21 Financial Instruments continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2014, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.

The zero coupon element has a redemption value of 6.25m fair value 5.8m and the redemption value of the interest rate swap element fair value 3.2m is based on a formula linked to thirty year sterling interest swap rates with higher amounts payable as rates rise.
Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 47 Notes to the Financial Statements 21 Financial Instruments continued Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans and debentures at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 30 April are shown below.
Interest Rate Risk Profile 2014 2013 000 000 Fixed rate sterling 39,712 79,679 Maturity Profile 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 Within Between 1 More than Within Between 1 More than 1 year and 5 years 5 years 1 year and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Repayment of loans and debentures 40,000 40,000 40,000 Interest on loans and debentures 2,550 10,200 11,475 3,739 10,200 14,025 2,550 10,200 51,475 43,739 10,200 54,025 Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond swap yields as at 30 April 2014 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 10,749,000 2013 11,088,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 5.6p 2013 6.1p.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 2,579,000 2013 3,443,000 and would have decreased net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 2.0p 2013 2.9p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 14 to 17.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments are contained in the Strategic Report.
95% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities 2013 99%.
The sensitivity of the Companys equity investments to general movements in equity markets has been adjusted by the use of the equity derivative instruments detailed on pages 49 and 50, with any sales of equity index futures reducing sensitivity to market movements and any purchase of equity index call options increasing it.
After taking into account the impact of any equity index futures and options open at the balance sheet date, a 5% increase in quoted equity valuations at 30 April 2014 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 45,824,000 2013 46,861,000.
A decrease of 5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board also sets parameters for the degree to which the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys current borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the maturity profile of its borrowings is set out above.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: wher e the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Bank of New York Mellon, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: 48 Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements 21 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk continued investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily done on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the creditworthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
Credit Risk Exposure The amount that best represents the Companys maximum exposure to direct credit risk at 30 April was: 2014 2013 000 000 Fixed interest investments 41,450 48,336 Cash and short term deposits 41,592 38,591 Debtors and prepayments 2,139 5,735 85,181 92,662 Includes non-monetary assets of 31,000 2013 44,000.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
