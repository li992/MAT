107 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 3.3 Property, plant and equipment The following section concerns the physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include manufacturing, distribution and office sites, as well as equipment used in the manufacture of the Groups products.
The cost of these assets represents the amount initially paid for them.
With the exception of the Groups land and assets under construction which have not yet been brought into use, a depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect the annual wear and tear and the reduction in the value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by reference to the assets useful lives, by estimating the number of years over which the Group expects the asset to be used.
As we do for our intangible assets see Section 3.2, if there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value a one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
Group contracts in respect of future capital expenditure which had been placed at the balance sheet date relating to the continuing business amounted to 7.6m 2013: 3.3m.
Included in the total net book value of plant and equipment is 1.0m 2013: 1.2m in respect of assets acquired under finance leases.
Depreciation for the year on these assets was 0.3m 2013: 0.3m.
