GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 167 OTHER INFORMATION Shareholder information continued Shareholder security We are aware that a small number of shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls concerning their investment in GKN.
These calls are from overseas based organisations who offer to buy GKN shares for considerably more than the current market price.
In some cases the caller has suggested that there is currently a takeover offer for GKN.
There is no such offer and we suspect that the calls are bogus.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited investment advice, offers to buy shares or offers of free company reports.
Operations, commonly known as boiler rooms, are targeting UK shareholders and callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
