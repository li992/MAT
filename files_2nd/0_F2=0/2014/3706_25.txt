No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

There is no material ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement.
The majority of foreign exchange and inflation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income statement as part of operating profit.
Where currency swaps offset movements in currency balances held, the movement in the fair value of these swaps is set against the income statement exchange movements arising on those balances.

Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligations per the Balance Sheet consist of: m 2014 2013 Defined benefit scheme assets 670.6 577.6 Defined benefit obligations 772.6 664.9 102.0 87.3 Pension expense included in employment costs in note 4 are as follows: m 2014 2013 Defined benefit schemes 5.5 5.2 Defined contribution schemes 25.5 24.4 31.0 29.6 The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003.
The Group also manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements, where the Groups contribution is fixed at a set percentage of employees pay.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries: the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2012.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2014.
In the UK, within 15 months of each triennial valuation, the employer and the trustees are required to agree a schedule of contributions to ensure that the Plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent basis.
The Group expects to contribute 23.5m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2015 and 23.1m in 2016.
This includes 18.4m 2016: 17.6m related to deficit funding.
On 1 July 2013 the liabilities related to past service of pensioners of the CPP on that date were subject to a buy-in arrangement.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the CPP transferred assets to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides an income stream to the Plan equivalent to the Plans obligations to pensioners covered by the arrangement.
This eliminated the Groups exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities.
The liabilities covered by this buy-in amounted to 242m, which had the impact of generating an actuarial loss of 39m.
This follows similar buy-in arrangements completed in 2011 related to past service of pensioner and deferred members of some of the smaller defined benefit schemes.
The insurance contract assets are measured at a value equal to the related liabilities.
In 2014 the CPP has made liability driven investments to provide further cover against interest and inflation volatility.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2014 or 2013 for the defined benefit schemes.
1.3m 2013: 1.2m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2014.
The principal financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2014 2013 UK USA UK USA schemes scheme schemes scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.45% 3.45% 3.80% 3.80% Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.20% 3.20% 3.55% 3.55% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.20% 3.20% 2.55% 3.55% Discount rate 3.50% 3.50% 4.50% 4.50% Inflation assumption 3.20% 3.20% 3.55% 3.55% The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actuarial tables which reflect actual recent mortality experience and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as SAPS CMI 13.
In practical terms, this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1949 2014 22.6 years Female 1949 2014 24.9 years Male 1980 2045 25.5 years Female 1980 2045 27.9 years At 31 December 2014 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2013: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2013: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2013: 80% of eligible members on retirement.

The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$42.7m 2013: US$35.5m and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme is US$27.0m 2013: US$26.2m.
The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in the OCI since transition to IFRS is 235.8m 2013: 208.1m.
Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year, the changes in financial assumptions are primarily driven by the movements in the discount rate and inflation assumption.
The actual return on scheme assets was 91.1m 2013: 48.0m before accounting for the actuarial loss of 39.0m generated on the buy-in transaction.
The weighted average duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 19 years.

The net liabilities are included in other liabilities in note 19.
The German based schemes are substantially covered by insurance policies.
Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to manage other exposures such as inflation risks.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk The Group is based in the UK, reports in sterling and has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practical, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk and, consequently, the net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Income Statement amounted to a gain of 5.8m 2013: 3.2m loss.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The Group has the following exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Balance Sheet, translated into sterling at the relevant year-end exchange rates: 2014 2013 Monetary Monetary Monetary Monetary assets liabilities assets liabilities US dollars 353.6 1,555.3 188.8 584.9 Euros 109.4 82.8 86.8 109.3 Australian dollars 47.4 45.8 56.2 54.2 Danish kroner 16.1 77.7 18.1 90.7 Other currencies 45.5 11.7 24.5 8.3 572.0 1,773.3 374.4 847.4 Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities 143.5 128.8 166.2 117.9 715.5 1,902.1 540.6 965.3 www.
com Cobham plc 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange differences arising from the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group typically borrows in the currency of the acquisition and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge.
Monetary liabilities in the table above include US dollar borrowings of 1,305.4m 2013: 482.4m and Danish krone borrowings of 71.0m 2013: 75.9m which match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets.
Foreign currency contracts are also used to manage exposure to currency risks.
On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include the monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in OCI and in the translation reserve note 26.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.
During 2014 forward contracts have been placed to sell US dollars for Danish kroner to mitigate the impact of US dollar sales now being made by the Groups Danish subsidiaries.
The sterling US dollar and Danish kroner US dollar exchange rates are the most important for the Group.
The Group has the following forward foreign currency contracts outstanding for net sales of US dollars for sterling and Danish kroner: Average US$: US$m amount exchange rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 Expiring within one year 110.9 124.1 1.60 1.59 Expiring within one to two years 14.7 38.0 1.54 1.58 Expiring after two years 47.6 71.6 1.56 1.56 US$ sterling contracts outstanding at 31 December 173.2 233.7 1.58 1.58 Average US$: DKK US$m amount exchange rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 Expiring within one year 138.1 9.6 5.53 5.55 Expiring within one to two years 125.1 5.47 Expiring after two years 28.3 5.34 US$ DKK contracts outstanding at 31 December 291.5 9.6 5.49 5.55 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is July 2022 and it is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitments.

Interest rate swaps outstanding at the year end are as follows: Period of swap contract 2014 2013 Currency Currency Hedged item Fixed rate from to value m value m Australian dollar loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$49.7m 26.1 AUS$58.0m 31.3 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$9.0m 4.7 AUS$10.8m 5.8 30.8 37.1 The Group does not currently hold any fair value hedging instruments such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.
There was no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates at the year end.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on managing liquidity risk throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with lenders.
Overdraft and revolving credit facilities provide short term flexibility whilst the revolving credit facilities provide longer term committed funding.
As shown in note 18, at 31 December 2014 undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 102.7m 2013: 37.7m were available to the Group in various currencies.
At an operating level, the Group has a positive cash flow from operating activities and where practical the funds generated by business units are managed on a regional basis.
In the UK and US, most business units utilise local bank facilities within a UK or US group arrangement.
This allows a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups borrowings and other financial liabilities, including derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
The difference between the contractual cash flows and the carrying amount of these liabilities reflects the effects of interest not included in the carrying amount and discounting applied in assessing fair value.

The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk related to liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range of reputable financial institutions.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for term deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables shown in note 16.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2014, 9.2% 2013: 8.2% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2014 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 17. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure 5.8m of receivables.
Bank term balances totalling 6.2m 2013: 6.4m have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets as described in note 15.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business, these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the Balance Sheet as shown in note 15.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event, the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Derivatives can also be offset by counterparties in the event of a default: net amounts that result on this basis are shown in note 15.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
The Group has one swap contract which was designed to manage the inherent inflation risk in a specific operational contract.
The fair value of this swap contract is included in derivative financial instruments shown in note 22.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain stakeholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Capital is defined as total equity excluding non-controlling interests and amounted to 1,111.4m at 31 December 2014 2013: 1,043.4m.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an appropriate finance structure through a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements are also considered: these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results as outlined on page 31.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.

The PSP scheme is offered to senior executives across the Group and allows for annual grants of conditional shares with vesting conditions based on the Groups financial performance, taking into account both market based conditions such as TSR growth and non-market based measures such as EPS growth or cash conversion respectively.
The scheme includes buy-out awards granted in 2013 and 2014 to the Groups CEO and CFO.
The PSP scheme also includes retention awards granted during 2014 which mainly vest in equal amounts after two or three years, conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.
Other schemes include ESOS, RSP, BCP and ShareSave elements.
In previous years, share options were awarded to senior executives under the ESOS scheme, with exercise conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period.
This scheme included a time-only section for US employees whereby options were granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary, conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
No new awards have been made under this scheme since 2013.
Restricted Share Plan awards RSPs have been granted for the first time during 2014.
This scheme gives the rights to acquire shares for nil consideration over a four year period, with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary, conditional only upon continued employment within the Group.
The Bonus Co-investment Plan BCP is offered to a small number of senior executives and provides matching shares where bonus awards are invested in shares.
Finally, the Group operates a ShareSave scheme which is open to all UK employees.
Further details of all the schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 64.
The number of awards outstanding at 31 December are as follows: Number of awards thousands of shares 2014 2013 PSP 10,380 8,544 ESOS 5,914 10,161 RSP 543 BCP 118 190 ShareSave 5,908 5,447 At 31 December 22,863 24,342 Details of movements in the awards under the PSP scheme are as follows: Number of awards thousands of shares 2014 2013 At 1 January 8,544 7,794 Awards granted 5,171 3,531 Awards forfeited or cancelled 2,491 2,315 Exercised 802 466 Expired 42 At 31 December 10,380 8,544 Weighted average remaining contractual life of PSP awards outstanding 1.46 years 1.38 years Number of PSP awards exercisable at 31 December thousands 40 669 Awards under the PSP schemes have been granted at various dates throughout the year, with main tranches in March, May and September 2014.
The average fair value of PSP awards granted during 2014 was 2.833 2013 awards: 2.223, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model modified by a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the likely impact of market related performance conditions.
The weighted average inputs into the models were as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted average share price 3.065 2.472 Expected life 2.82 years 2.96 years Expected employee cancellation rate 4.1% 1.8% Risk free rate 0.9% 0.3% Cobham plc www.
com 112 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rates are based on assessments of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees.
Most participants of the PSP schemes receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation models.
The fair values of ESOS and ShareSave awards are significantly lower than for PSP, RSP and BCP awards due to the effect of the exercise price which is set based upon the market value of the Companys ordinary shares around the date of grant.
28. Business combinations Businesses acquired during the year On 12 September 2014 Aeroflex Holding Corp. Aeroflex was acquired following a public offer and the purchase of 92% of the share capital.
The remaining shares have been purchased in 2015.
Approximately 70% of Aeroflexs revenue is focused on commercial markets with exposure to wireless, space, microelectronics, industrial, energy and other sectors, increasing the proportion of Cobhams commercial revenue and building on Cobhams focus on connectivity capabilities, customers and characteristics.
Aeroflex operations are being integrated into Cobhams Advanced Electronic Solutions and Communications and Connectivity Sectors.
The scale and complementary nature of this acquisition is expected to enable Cobham to unlock significant synergy benefits, generating increased shareholder value, whilst supporting customers more effectively.
Further details can be found on pages 18 and 19.
Fair value information The fair value of the business combination can be analysed as follows: m Total Cash consideration paid 523.5 Cash consideration to be paid for remaining shares 49.3 572.8 A summary of the fair values of the net assets acquired is as follows: m Total Intangible assets 517.4 Property, plant and equipment 48.6 Investment properties 0.8 Trade and other receivables 12.8 Non-current assets 579.6 Inventories 118.4 Trade and other receivables 55.9 Cash and cash equivalents 39.4 Current assets 213.7 Borrowings 362.3 Trade and other payables 70.5 Provisions 7.8 Current tax liabilities 13.1 Current liabilities 453.7 Trade and other payables 6.4 Provisions 2.6 Deferred tax 144.3 Non-current liabilities 153.3 Net assets acquired 186.3 Goodwill 386.5 572.8 The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and subject to potential adjustment.
com Cobham plc 113 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of the total cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce.
Synergies are expected to arise from cross-selling revenue benefits, site consolidation, supply chain efficiency, implementation of the Cobham Standard Operating Framework and elimination of duplicate corporate overheads.
Goodwill is not anticipated to be deductible for tax purposes.
The gross value of acquired trade and other receivables is 73.9m.
These are included in the table above at their fair value of 68.7m.
Contingent liabilities recognised as provisions and included in the table above include amounts relating to outstanding legal settlements and environmental remediation provisions in respect of a number of Aeroflexs sites.
The majority of these are expected to be settled within one year although some are longer term provisions.
Results of business combinations Third party revenue of Aeroflex, since the date of acquisition, was 123.7m.
The post-acquisition loss after tax was 5.7m including the impacts of amortisation of the intangible assets which are recognised as a result of the business combination and writing off the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up on acquisition.
If this business combination had taken effect on 1 January 2014, it is estimated that Group total revenues would have been 2,110.0m and profit after tax 31.5m.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results had the operations been acquired at the start of the year, nor of future results of the combined operations.
The net cash flows resulting from business combinations are as follows: m Total Cash consideration paid Aeroflex and Axell 523.2 Net debt acquired 322.9 846.1 Costs of 21.4m were incurred in relation to business combinations.
These costs are recognised within administrative expenses in the Income Statement and included within other acquisition related costs excluded from underlying profit as shown in note 2.
In the Group consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 December 2013, the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired for FBH were marked as provisional.
Following further review the opening balance sheet has been amended to reflect an increase in trade and other payables of 1.8m, a decrease in current tax liabilities of 2.5m and an increase in deferred tax assets of 0.4m.
Goodwill has therefore been adjusted accordingly.
Operating lease arrangements At the balance sheet date the Group had outstanding commitments for minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: m 2014 2013 Within one year 41.8 26.0 Between one and two years 24.0 23.4 Between two and three years 23.3 21.0 Between three and four years 20.1 18.8 Between four and five years 16.2 16.3 After five years 53.6 63.4 179.0 168.9 Operating lease payments during the year totalled 27.3m 2013: 30.4m including rental costs of 6.9m 2013: 7.1m relating to operational aircraft used in the Groups service businesses: the remainder primarily relates to the rental of office and operating facilities.
Operating lease commitments include 12.0m related to onerous leases which have been provided for at the balance sheet date.
com 114 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30.
Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2014, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims.
Management do not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, would have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2014.
As notified in prior years, the Group has previously identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years.
The contract was in respect of goods provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount of revenue for the Group.
The circumstances surrounding this remain under review and neither the outcome nor timing of resolution can be estimated.
No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business, whose resolution is uncertain and could materially impact the Groups future reported earnings.
In particular, on fixed price development contracts, costs incurred and anticipated can significantly exceed amounts estimated at inception as a result of material enhancements to the specifications originally agreed under the contracts.
Judgement is therefore required as regards the final costs of technical solutions, the outcome of negotiations with customers and the amounts recoverable under these contracts..
The Directors take account of the advice of experts in making these judgements and believe that the outcome of negotiations will result in an appropriate recovery of costs incurred in excess of original baselines.
On 24 February 2014 the Group voluntarily contacted the United States Department of Justice DoJ to inform it that Cobham had undertaken an initial internal investigation into potentially irregular sales practices concerning sales to Asia of certain commercial, non-classified products manufactured by TracStar Systems Inc..
This matter was satisfactorily concluded with the DoJ during the year with no material cost to the Group.
Related party transactions Sales of goods to related parties were made on an arms length basis.
No guarantees have been given to, or received from, related parties.
No expense has been recognised for bad or doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties.
Transactions between Group entities and joint ventures and associates during the year were as follows: m 2014 2013 Sales of goods 0.4 Purchases of goods 1.0 0.3 Dividends received from joint ventures 3.7 Loan repayments and interest received from joint ventures 3.0 Compensation of key management personnel Details of the compensation of key management personnel can be found in note 4.
The Directors of Cobham plc had no material transactions with the Company during the year, other than as a result of service agreements.
