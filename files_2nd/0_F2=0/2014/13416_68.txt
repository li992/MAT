The cash flow projections used in these calculations are based on the Groups financial budget for 2015, as approved by the board in December 2014, and the Groups financial plans in respect of 2016 and 2017.
As highlighted in the principal accounting policies, the calculation of value in use requires the use of estimates which, although based on managements best knowledge, may ultimately differ from actual results.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: a Discount rates.
The pre tax discount rates used in the value in use calculations are set out in the table below.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups pre tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each region in which the CGUs operate.
Cash flows beyond the three year planning horizon have been extrapolated using growth rates of 1.6% for Europe 2013: 2.0%, 2.1% for the US 2013: 2.4%, 5.0% for Brazil 2013: 4.8% and at rates ranging between 3.3% and 6.8% for all other operations CGUs 2013: 3.3% and 6.8%.
The growth rates used do not exceed the long term GDP growth rates relating to each region in which the CGUs operate.
Forecasts for sales and margins are based on analyses of sales, markets, costs and competitors.
Consideration is given to past experience and knowledge of future contracts.
Forecasts for aluminium costs are based on forward prices and time projections after taking into account pass through of costs and hedging.
Forecasts for other raw materials and energy costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors.
Sensitivities With respect to all CGUs or groups of CGUs, management considers that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below carrying value at 31 December 2014.
