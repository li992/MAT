In April 2009 the Group disposed of its pet and aquatics segment, retaining a 5.5 per cent share of both businesses.
Following a subsequent reorganisation Cranswick plc sold its 5.5 per cent investment in the pet products business on 5 April 2012 for a consideration of 221,000.
The consideration for the sale was received in cash in the prior year.
The transaction resulted in the Group retaining its 5.5 per cent interest in the Aquatics business: this interest was later reduced to a 3.3 per cent holding of Tropical Marine Centre 2012 Limited following a further reorganisation and change in major shareholders.
The investment, being an unquoted entity, the value of which cannot be reliably measured, is held at a carrying value of nil.
