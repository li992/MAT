Fidessa group plc 56 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued p Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
q Employee share trusts The trusts and share plan trustees, which purchase and hold shares in connection with employee share plans, are included in the financial statements and presented as a deduction from equity.
Any consideration paid or received by them for the purchase or sale of the shares is shown as a movement in equity.
r Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
No provision is recognised when it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability and instead a contingent liability is disclosed.

4 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions take account of the circumstances and facts at the period end, historical experience of similar situations and other factors that are believed to be reasonable and relevant, the results for which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The estimates and judgements that are likely to be the most material are summarised below.
This summary is not a list of all uncertainties, estimates and judgements encountered and others could arise that cause a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets or liabilities.
