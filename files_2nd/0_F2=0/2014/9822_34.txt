Costs in respect of this restructuring were incurred in both the current and prior period.
The exceptional charge of 50.6 million 2013: 10.8 million includes an amount of 29.6 million 2013: nil in respect of the impairment of non-core properties.
Portfolio disposal of pubs During the current period the Group disposed of a portfolio of 202 pubs and subsequently entered into a four year lease and five year management agreement in respect thereof.
The loss on disposal was 35.8 million and revaluation surpluses of 37.5 million were transferred from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings upon disposal, giving a net impact of 1.7 million.
The Group no longer has strategic control of these pubs and they do not form part of its core activities.
As such the results in respect of the ongoing operation and management of these pubs post disposal have been shown as a non-underlying item, which is comprised as follows: 2014 m Revenue 27.7 Operating expenses 29.6 1.9 Recognition of onerous lease provisions and associated leasehold impairments A review of the Groups property leases in the current period identified that an additional provision of 28.0 million was required for leases which are considered to be onerous, along with an associated impairment of leasehold properties of 1.5 million.
This is primarily due to the reversion of a number of leases to the Group in the period and a deterioration in market conditions.
Defined benefit pension plan During the current period the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to future accrual.
The net credit of 10.8 million is comprised of the negative past service cost of 11.2 million less associated costs of 0.4 million.
Rank refunds In previous periods the Group received refunds totalling 5.9 million from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
This followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc Rank, which concluded that there had been a breach of fiscal neutrality in the treatment of gaming machine income as liable to UK VAT.
HMRC issued protective assessments to recover the repayments pending the result of further Court hearings.
On 30 October 2013 the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and the Group has now repaid the refunds of 5.9 million plus interest of 0.3 million thereon.
In the prior period the Group had recognised a provision for the 5.9 million repayment and interest of 0.5 million.
As such there was a reduction in the interest accrual of 0.2 million in the current period.
Buyback of securitised debt and associated costs During the current period the Group repurchased all of its securitised AB1 notes at par.
The notes, with a nominal value of 80.0 million, were immediately cancelled and the associated floating-to-fixed interest rate swap held in respect of this tranche of securitised debt was terminated.
This swap had been designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecast floating rate interest payments arising in respect of the AB1 notes.
As these forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur the cumulative hedging loss of 24.7 million has been recognised in the income statement.
