Detailed information concerning Directors remuneration, interests and options is shown in the table within the Directors Remuneration Report which is subject to audit on pages 61 to 79 which forms part of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Retirement benefit obligations The Companys employees are members of the UK defined benefit schemes, details of which are disclosed in note 11 to the Group financial statements.
Whilst the Group reports under IFRS, the UK GAAP equivalent figures for the UK schemes would not be significantly different.
Asthe Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes, due mainly to changes in the Groups corporate structure over the years, the Company has accounted as though the schemes were defined contribution schemes and has charged the contributions paid each year to the profit and loss account.
