Contingent consideration The agreement included contingent consideration payable in cash to the previous owners of Kingston Foods Limited based on the performance of the business over a three year period from acquisition.
The amount payable was between nil and 2.5 million dependent on the average EBITDA of the business during the three year period versus an agreed target level.
