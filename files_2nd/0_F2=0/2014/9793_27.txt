Taxation reconciliation continued After excluding non-underlying items the underlying effective tax rate was 18.8% last year 22.7%.
The non-underlying adjustment to the tax charge in respect of prior periods arises from the successful outcome of litigation in relation to the Groups claim for UK tax relief of losses of its former European subsidiaries 18.5m, last year nil and release of provisions following settlement of historic disputes with the tax authorities 7.5m, last year 20.4m.
On 2 July 2013, the Finance Bill received its final reading in the House of Commons and so the previously announced reduced rates of corporation tax of 21% from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 and 20% from 1 April 2015 onwards were substantively enacted.
The Group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 20%, which has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 22.5m in the income statement reducing the total effective tax rate by 3.9%, and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 11.3m in other comprehensive income.
8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The underlying earnings per share gures have also been calculated based on earnings before items that are one-off in nature, signi cant and are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements and other information Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 103 Financial statements 11 Retirement bene ts The Group provides pension arrangements for the bene t of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme a fide ned bene t arrangement which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002 and Your M&S Pension Saving Plan a fide ned contribution arrangement which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The fide ned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund such contributions are based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid.
Members bene ts are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement.
As a result, actuarial risk that bene ts will be lower than expected and investment risk that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations fall on the employee.
The fide ned bene t arrangement operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 13,000 active members last year 13,000, 55,000 deferred members last year 55,000 and 51,000 pensioners last year 51,000.
At the year end, the fide ned contribution arrangement had some 38,000 active members last year 33,000 and some 5,000 deferred members last year 3,000.
The scheme is governed by a Trustee board which is independent of the Group.
The Group also operates a small funded fide ned bene t pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
This scheme ceased to future accrual from 31 October 2013.
Retirement bene ts also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement bene ts.
Within the total Group retirement bene t cost of 53.5m last year restated 64.3m, 27.0m last year restated 40.0m relates to the UK fide ned bene t section, 41.7m last year 20.3m to the UK fide ned contribution section and 15.2 m last year 4.0m to other retirement bene t schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the UK fide ned Bene t Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 and showed a fide cit of 290m.
As a result a funding plan of 112m cash contributions was agreed with the Trustees.
The Group has contributed c. 28m to the UK fide ned bene t scheme on 31 March 2014 and expects to contribute an additional c. 28m each year until 31 March 2017.
The difference between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by better than expected investment returns on the schemes assets.
Future contributions to meet the cost of accruing bene ts to the UK scheme are made at the rate of 23.4% of pensionable salaries up to the next full actuarial valuation.
By funding its fide ned bene t pension schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated.
This could occur for several reasons, for example: Investment returns on the schemes assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes liabilities: The level of price in ation may be higher from that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes: Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to unanticipated advances in medical healthcare.
Members may also exercise or not exercise options in a way that leads to increases in the schemes liabilities, for example through early retirement or commutation of pension for cash: Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes liabilities.
In addition, the Group has an obligation to the UK fide ned bene t scheme via the interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership refer to note 12, through which the Group is exposed to additional risks.
In particular, under the legal terms of the Partnership, a default by the Group on the rental payments to the Partnership or a future change in legislation could trigger earlier or higher payments, or an increase in the collateral to be provided by the Group.

Financial assumptions The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent quali ed actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Bene ts in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes and are as follows: 2014 2013 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service 2.2 3.3 2.4 3.2 Discount rate 4.45 4.30 In ation rate 3.4 3.4 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.4 7.1 The in ation rate of 3.4% re ects the Retail Price Index RPI rate.
Certain bene ts have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price Index CPI as the in ationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.4% last year 2.4% has been used.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.5% the surplus would increase decrease by c. 50m.
If the in ation rate increased decreased by 0.25%, the surplus would decrease increase by c. 50m.
C. Demographic assumptions Apart from post-retirement mortality, the demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme performed as at 31 March 2012.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2012 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The speci c mortality rates used are based on the VITA lite tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2014 2013 Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.4 22.4 females 24.1 24.1 Future pensioners at age 65 males 21.8 21.8 females 24.6 24.5 Deferred pensioners at age 65 males 22.6 22.5 females 25.4 25.4 An increase of one year in the life expectancies would decrease the surplus by c. 230m.
D. Analysis of assets The investment strategy of the UK fide ned bene t pension scheme is driven by its liability pro le, in particular its in ation-linked pension bene ts.
In addition to its interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership refer to note 12, the scheme invests in different types of bonds including corporate bonds and gilts and derivative instruments including in ation, interest rate, cross-currency and total return swaps in order to align movements in the value of its assets with movements in its liabilities arising from changes in market conditions.
Broadly the scheme has hedging that covers 80% of interest rate movements and 84% of in ation movements, as measured on the Trustees funding assumptions which use a discount rate derived from gilt yields.

12 Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership Marks and Spencer plc is a general partner and the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme is a limited partner of the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership the Partnership.
As such, the Partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group.
The Partnership holds 1.6bn last year 1.6bn of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the exibility to substitute alternative properties.
The limited partnership interest held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 71.9m from the pro ts of the Partnership earned from rental income.
This distribution was previously discretionary at the instance of Marks and Spencer plc.
On 21 May 2012 the Group changed the terms of the Partnership to waive the Groups limited discretionary right over the annual distributions from the Partnership to the Pension Trustee.
The change was re ected by the derecognition of the related equity instrument and recognition of a financial liability from this date.
The Partnership liability to the Marks and Spencer UK pension scheme of 568.7m is valued at the net present value of the future expected distributions from the Partnership.
During the year to 29 March 2014 an interest charge of 17.8m last year 16.6m was recognised in the income statement representing the unwinding of the discount included in this obligation.
Under IAS 19, the Partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued at 574.7m last year 645.7m, refer to note 11 D.

Of the total share-based payments charge, 9.6m last year 13.4m relates to the Save As You Earn Share Option scheme.
The remaining charge is spread over the other schemes.
Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 77.
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.

Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan is the primary long-term incentive plan for approximately 100 of the most senior managers and was first approved by shareholders in 2005.
Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on cumulative underlying basic earnings per share, return on capital employed, and revenue over three years.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 67.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.

The price at which the options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the offer date.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
During the year, 62,734 options last year 147,557 were granted, at a fair value of 105.1p last year 73.8p.
As at 29 March 2014, 251,545 options last year 400,174 were outstanding under the scheme.
F. Marks and Spencer Employee Bene t Trust The Marks and Spencer Employee Bene t Trust the Trust holds 2,595,343 shares last year 8,046,847 with a book value of 8.6m last year 26.9m and a market value of 11.8m last year 31.4m.
These shares were acquired by the Trust in the market and are shown as a reduction in retained earnings in the consolidated statement of financial position.
In addition, the Trust has entered into a call option to purchase up to 1,600,000 of the Companys shares expiring June 2014.
The Trust used funds provided by Marks and Spencer plc to meet the Groups obligations.
Awards are granted to employees at the discretion of Marks and Spencer plc and shares awarded to employees by the Trust in accordance with the wishes of Marks and Spencer plc under senior executive share schemes.
Dividends are waived on all of these plans.
Nil cost options For the purposes of calculating the number of shares awarded, the share price used is the average of the mid-market price for the five consecutive dealing days preceding the grant date.

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units CGUs which include the combined retail and wholesale businesses for each location.
Brands consist of the per una brand cost of 80.0m and the M&S Mode brands of 32.4m.
The per una brand is a fide nite life intangible asset and is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years and is only assessed for impairment where such indicators exist.
The M&S Mode brands have been attributed an inde nite life as they give the Group the future right to use the M&S brand across Europe.
This is consistent with the Groups expansion plans in Europe and existing M&S brand recognition from its current presence.
Similar to goodwill, the M&S Mode brands are assessed for impairment annually based on their value in use.
The M&S Mode brands have been allocated for impairment testing across the European business.
The value in use calculations use cash ows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a three year period.
These budgets have regard to historic performance and knowledge of the current market, together with managements views on the future achievable growth and the impact of committed initiatives.
The cash ows which derive from the budgets include ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain the store network.
Cash ows beyond this three year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the long-term growth rate and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The long-term growth rate has been determined with reference to forecast GDP growth for the territories in which these businesses operate.
Management believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill and brands under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not re ect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
These growth Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 110 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing continued rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
The pre-tax discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which speci c market-related premium adjustments are made.
The values attributed to the key assumptions are as follows: Long-term growth rate Pre-tax discount rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 % % % % per una 2.0 2.0 11.0 10.7 Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 2.5 1.5 13.1 12.2 Supreme Trademarks Private Limited 6.0 6.0 18.3 17.4 Marks and Spencer Hungary KFT 1.5 17.0 The M&S Mode brands are tested based on the regions operating in the European business.
The discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 13.1% to 28.9% last year 12.2% to 20.9%.
Cash ows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated at long-term growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 2.5% last year nil% to 1.5%.
Sensitivity analysis Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic it is possible that an impairment would be identi ed if any of the above key assumptions were changed signi cantly.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of these key assumptions with other variables held constant.
Management have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of goodwill or brands to exceed the value in use.
Additions to property, plant and equipment during the year amounting to nil last year nil were nanced by new finance leases.

Interest on these bonds is payable semi-annually.
On 24 March 2014 the Group repaid 400.2m of 5.625% medium-term notes.
Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is five years last year five years and 125 years last year 125 years for property.
Interest rates are xed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a xed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
21 Financial instruments Treasury policy The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due: The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained pro ts, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements and other information Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 113 Financial statements 21 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued a Liquidity funding risk continued At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.325bn set to mature on 28 September 2018 and a facility of 150m set to mature on 16 May 2014 with an option to extend to a facility of 100m maturing on 16 May 2015.
These facilities contain only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 80m last year 105m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of 233.9m last year 81.0m was drawn under the committed facilities and 22.5m last year nil was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.1bn last year 1.5bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
The 5.625% 400m medium-term loan note was repaid in March 2014.

Exposures are managed through the Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings AA3 or better, assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved by exception by the CFO.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.
The table below analyses the Groups short-term investments and derivative assets by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash and cash in transit.
Includes cash on deposit and money market funds held by Marks & Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership, Marks & Spencer plc and M. S. General Insurance LP.
Excludes the embedded derivative within the lease host contract.
Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to treasury policy.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 128m last year 114m, other receivables 136m last year 60m, cash and cash equivalents 182m last year 193m and derivatives 54m last year 108m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate, hedge cover can be taken out for longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash ow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in comprehensive income.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables, then associated fair value movements previously recognised in comprehensive income are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 1,600m last year 1,342m with a weighted average maturity date of six months last year seven months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 29 March 2014 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 16 months last year 15 months from the balance sheet date.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements and other information Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 115 Financial statements 21 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued c Foreign currency risk continued The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
As at the balance sheet date 162m of currency debt last year 200m of derivatives and HK$698m last year HK$484m of derivatives was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 417m last year 307m.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities excluding short-term payables and the liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme which has no currency or interest rate exposure is set out below: 2014 2013 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 1,226.5 708.6 1,935.1 1,929.9 318.1 2,248.0 Euro 6.6 139.3 145.9 3.9 6.7 10.6 Other 22.8 22.8 27.4 27.4 1,233.1 870.7 2,103.8 1,933.8 352.2 2,286.0 The oating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and six months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the xed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.3% last year 5.6% and the weighted average time for which the rate is xed is nine years last year eight years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar and euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of xed and oating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, xed rate borrowings amounted to 1,233.1m last year 1,933.8m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 59% last year 85% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2014 2013 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 1.0 1.2 Medium-term notes 5.3 5.6 Finance leases 4.3 4.3 Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 116 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments 2014 2013 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 12.1 50.9 34.0 12.8 held for trading 1.6 0.6 3.6 0.9 net investment hedges 4.9 13.7 51.5 42.5 13.7 Non-current Cross currency swaps cash ow hedges 62.3 3.2 12.4 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 0.3 0.9 3.8 0.7 Interest rate swaps fair value hedge 17.9 12.2 32.4 Embedded derivative see note 5 22.4 25.9 40.6 75.4 65.3 13.1 The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to redesignate its sterling xed debt to oating debt.
These are reported as fair value hedges.
The ineffective portion recognised in the pro t or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to 0.5m last year nil as the gain on the hedged item was 33.7m last year 8.0m loss and the loss on the hedging instrument was 34.2m last year 8.0m gain.
The Group also holds a number of cross currency swaps to redesignate its xed rate US dollar debt to xed rate sterling debt.
These are reported as cash ow hedges.
Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to the Groups financial instruments.
The Directors consider that a 2% - last year 2% movement in interest rates and a 20% - last year 20% weakening in sterling represents a reasonable possible change.
However this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates re ects the effect on the Groups oating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity re ects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact from foreign exchange movements re ects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the Statement of Financial Position but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
Fair Value Hierachy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: not traded in an active market but the fair values are based on quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments include OTC derivatives: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signi cant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Unlisted equity investments are included in Level 3.

Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an ef cient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and exibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash ow to net debt see note 27 and xed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition, the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced long-term debt maturity pro le.
As at the balance sheet date the Groups average debt maturity pro le was nine years last year eight years.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poors.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
