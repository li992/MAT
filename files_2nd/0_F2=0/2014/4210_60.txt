The environmental provision relates to soil and potential ground water contamination on a number of sites, both currently in use and previously occupied, in Europe and the Americas.
In relation to the environmental provision, the Directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
Provisions for remediation costs are made when there is a present obligation, it is probable that expenditures for remediation work will be required and the cost can beestimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes.
The costs are based on currently available facts and prior experience.
Environmental liabilities are recorded at the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled at the balance sheet date.
Remediation of environmental damage typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin.
In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available.
Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly.
The level of environmental provision is based on managements best estimate of the most likely outcome for each individual exposure.
The Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is not material.
