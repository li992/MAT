Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 95 22 Financial risk management continued Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value.
The fair value is determined by reference to the rates at which they could be exchanged by knowledgeable and willing parties.
Fair value is determined by discounting forecast cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.
There exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final valuation and timing of cash flows arising from these assets.
As a result the Group has applied inputs based on current market conditions and the Groups historic experience of actual cash flows resulting from such arrangements.
These inputs are by nature estimates and as such the fair value has been classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid out in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Significant unobservable inputs into the fair value measurement calculation include regional house price movements based on the Groups actual experience of regional house pricing and management forecasts of future movements, weighted average duration from inception to settlement of 10 years 2013: 10 years and discount rate 8% 2013: 8% based on current observed market interest rates offered to private individuals on secured second loans.
The discounted forecast cash flow calculation is dependent upon the estimated future value of the properties on which the available for sale financial assets are secured.
Adjustments to this input, which might result from a change in the wider property market, would have a proportional impact upon the fair value of the asset.
Furthermore, whilst not easily assessable in advance, the resulting change in security value may affect the credit risk associated with the counterparty, influencing fair value further.
Detail of the movements in available for sale financial assets in the period are disclosed in note 17.
