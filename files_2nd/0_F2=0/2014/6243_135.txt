Sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the value in use computation of their recoverable amount using price assumptions of US$1,250 per ounce and US$18 per ounce for gold and silver, respectively.
Management consider that the model supporting the determination of value in use is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs, where a reasonable possible change in prices could lead to an impairment.
As at 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of Cinega mine is US$240.5 million.
In regard to Noche Buena mine the carrying amount is US$141 million.
The following table sets out the approximate expected impairment which would be recognised in 2015 at hypothetical decreases in commodity prices: Decrease in commodity prices Cinega Noche Buena Gold Silver US$ thousands US$ thousands Low sensitivity 5% 10% 18,033 High sensitivity 10% 20% 127,124 37,986 15.
