Share-based payments Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty percent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and fifty percent of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan CIP The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares.
Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR target.
The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index CPI for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2.
Ten percent per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1.
