Other changes in 2013 relate to the release of an earn-out provision of 4,276,000 relating to a 2008 acquisition which was credited to goodwill, and other adjustments relating to the re-assessment of initial fair values.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash-Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
The MSI and AMI businesses moved from the Aircraft & Vehicle Systems division into the Information & Power Systems division and Tactical & Sonar Systems division respectively.
Prior year comparators have been restated.
Goodwill relating to the legacy DNE business has been reallocated between the Tactical Communication Systems and EMS businesses during 2014.
Introduction 98 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2014 varied between 10.8% and 13.7% 2013: 12.3% to 13.8%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historical experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2019 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
ii apply a 10% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
iii consider specific market factors.
Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to potential impairments at SOTECH, Airport Systems, AEP and Tactical Communications Systems.
Headroom for these businesses, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows: Tactical Communication Systems 32.3m, Airport Systems 4.9m, SOTECH 16.5m and AEP 8.3m.
Consideration of specific market factors has identified the following: a in Tactical Communication Systems a material delay in bringing a key programme to market, combined with failure to secure sufficient business with new and existing customers would result in impairment b following the termination of the Oman Airport IT contract, the Airport Systems CGU is sensitive to the ability of the remaining business to win sufficient new customers over the medium term: and c the SOTECH CGU is sensitive to the ability to successfully expand the business into new geographic areas and market sectors.
Accordingly if assumption ii was extended further, the level of reduction to forecast operating profits required to indicate impairment is as follows: Tactical Communication Systems 60%, Airport Systems 14%, SOTECH 43% and AEP: 15%.
Following a review of the performance of our businesses in the Middle East, a potential indicator of impairment was identified for the Blue Sky Group CGU, and an impairment review was undertaken.
The value-in-use of the Blue Sky Group CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of 7.4m has been recorded in the year.
The pretax discount rate used during this assessment was 10.8%.
Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the Blue Sky Group CGU as at 31 December 2014 is nil.
As set out in note 2, the 7.4m impairment charge has been included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group.
Blue Sky Group is within the Aircraft & Vehicle Systems operating segment.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The reduction in placement of US service contracts particularly impacted the ProLogic business.
During the prior year the value-in-use of the ProLogic CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of 44.2m was recorded in administrative expenses in 2013.
As set out in note 2, the 44.2m prior year impairment charge was included as part of the non-underlying operating results of the Group.
ProLogic is within the Information & Power Systems operating segment.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 16 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: 3 to 5 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years 6.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was nil 2013: 48,000.
Depreciation charged in the year on assets held under finance leases was nil 2013: 65,000.
Included within Land and Buildings is nil 2013: nil of assets in the course of construction.
16 Interest in associate 2014 2013 000 000 The value of the Groups investment is made up as follows: Total assets 15,085 13,894 Total liabilities 6,980 6,577 Interest in associate 8,105 7,317 2014 2013 000 000 Total revenue of associate 41,340 29,370 Groups share of profit recognised 1,957 1,424 The Groups interest in associate is represented by its 49% holding of ordinary shares in Al Shaheen Adventure LLC, a Company incorporated in the UAE.
The Group has significant influence over the entity but does not control it, consequently the associate is incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
