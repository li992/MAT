On 13 May 2013 the Group formed a 50:50 joint venture, Walworth Investment Properties Limited WIP, to acquire a portfolio of South London residential properties previously wholly-owned by the Group.
At 30 September 2014, the Groups interest in joint ventures was as follows: % of ordinary share capital held Country of incorporation Curzon Park Limited 50 United Kingdom King Street Developments Hammersmith Limited 50 United Kingdom New Sovereign Reversions Limited 50 United Kingdom Walworth Investment Properties Limited 50 United Kingdom CCZ a. s. 50 Czech Republic CCY a. s. 50 Czech Republic Prazsky Project a. s. 50 Czech Republic The accounting period end of Curzon Park Limited is 28 February.

The White Paper on the proposed High Speed Rail Network from London to Birmingham indicates that the potential route will cover at least part of our development site at Curzon Park in Birmingham.
We are assessing the long-term impact with our advisers and aim to collaborate with other affected owners in the area.
In view of the uncertainty relating to the future of the Curzon Park site, the Group is seeking advice in order to protect its position.
Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to repay the bank loan in the joint venture entity and recover the carrying value of the Groups investment, the Group may incur further charges.
HS2 remains a clear policy from this government and HS2 Ltd, part of Department of Transport, continue to prepare the work required to allow the proposal to be submitted to parliament later this year.
This subsequently targets a date at the end of 2015 for Royal Assent by parliament legal permission to construct line, leading to Compulsory Purchase Orders CPO in 2016.
We have no current view from advisers on possible CPO value.
If the CPO did occur it is most likely that only part of the site would be subject to CPO, as only part of the site is on the line of the new railway station.
We could therefore have the opportunity to develop the remainder of the site, as a gateway next to the new HS2 station.
As a result of challenges to the planning consent obtained in relation to the Czech Republic joint ventures, the directors have reviewed the carrying value of the investment and impaired the investment by 2.4m to leave a carrying value of nil.
In relation to the Groups investment in joint ventures, the Groups share of the aggregated assets, liabilities, revenues and profit or loss are shown below.
