The tax credit for the year can be reconciled to the loss per the consolidated income statement as follows: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Group loss profit on ordinary activities before tax 384.0 285.4 Group loss profit on ordinary activities before tax at 64.0% weighted average rate 2013: 30.5% 245.7 87.2 Tax effects of: Income expenses that are not taxable deductible in determining taxable profit 21.1 31.8 Tax and tax credits not related to profit before tax 50.4 70.2 Unrecognised tax losses 23.8 17.8 Utilisation and recognition of tax losses not previously recognised 11.2 0.2 Adjustments in respect of prior years 1.9 22.3 Write down of deferred tax asset previously recognised 86.8 7.3 Tax credit charge for the year 173.7 51.4 Effective tax rate for the year 45.2% 18.0% The weighted average rate is calculated based on the tax rates weighted according to the profit or loss before tax earned by the group in each jurisdiction.
The change in the weighted average rate year-on-year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each jurisdiction.
The standard tax rate on UK ring fence profits is 62 per cent 2013: 62 per cent.
In the Autumn Statement, the UK Chancellor announced a two per cent reduction in the supplementary tax charge on profits from 32 to 30 per cent, however, as at 31 December 2014 this was not substantively enacted.
Tax not related to profit before tax includes the impact of ring fence expenditure supplement US$141.9 million, partially offset by the impact of the UK PRT charge.

The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects.
These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of on-going exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
During the year, the group sold its interest in the PL359 licence in Norway, which contained the Luno II discovery, for US$38.2 million cash consideration, recognising a loss before tax of US$9.7 million.

Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
Impairment The impairment charge in the current year relates to the Balmoral area US$159.0 million, Huntington US$186.0 million and Solan US$387.3 million fields in the UK, the Chim So field in Vietnam US$41.8 million, the Kakap field in Indonesia US$5.0 million and the Chinguetti field in Mauritania US$5.3 million.
The impairment charge of US$784.4 million was calculated by comparing the future discounted pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves the value-in-use against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2015 and 2016, and US$85 bbl in real terms thereafter and were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent for the UK assets 2013: 10 per cent and 12.5 per cent for the non-UK assets 2013: 12.5 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.
The principal cause of the impairment charge being recognised in the year is a reduction in the short to medium term oil price assumption being used when determining the future discounted cash flows for each field.
In addition to the impact of the reduced oil price assumption, a review of the expected decommissioning costs for the Balmoral area in the first half of 2014 has also driven part of the impairment charge, whilst the Solan impairment has in part been caused by an increase in the costs incurred to date and expected costs to complete the project.

Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment continued The recoverable amount of the assets that have been impaired in the year, based on the value-in-use assumptions set out above are: Balmoral area US$34.5 million, Solan US$759.0 million, Huntington US$91.4 million, Chim So US$484.2 million and Kakap US$27.6 million.
The Chinguetti field has no remaining net book value at 31 December 2014.
During the year, the group disposed of its interest in the Scott area assets in the UK North Sea for US$130 million, resulting in a pre-tax profit of US$96.3 million.
In addition, the group announced its intention to sell its interests in Block A Aceh in Indonesia, resulting in the asset being reclassified as held for sale at 31 December 2014.
An anticipated loss of US$76.9 million has been recognised for the sale of Block A Aceh, which was completed in early January 2015.
At 31 December 2014, the assets separately held on the balance sheet for Block A Aceh are US$56.7 million being principally US$25.5 million of intangible E&E assets and US$102.5 million of PP&E, prior to a loss of US$76.9 million and associated liabilities of US$1.8 million.
The overall gain on disposal of non-current assets of US$2.7 million also includes the loss recognised in relation to PL359 in Norway see note 8 and the write-off of deferred consideration of US$7.0 million previously held for the disposal of Block 07 03 in Vietnam during 2013.
Goodwill Goodwill of US$ 240.8 million has been specifically assigned to the Catcher field in the UK, which is considered the cash generating unit for the purposes of any impairment testing of this goodwill.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value-in-use calculations with the same key assumptions as noted for the impairment calculations above.
The discount rate used is 10 per cent 2013: 10 per cent.
The value-in-use forecast, which is formally approved by management, takes into consideration cash flows which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher field as a whole, currently expected to be around 2027.
This period exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard reservoir estimation techniques.
The headroom between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount, including the goodwill, is US$23.9 million.
If the long-term oil price assumption used to determine the value-in-use of the Catcher field reduced by US$1.1 bbl from 2017 onwards, the recoverable amount of the Catcher field would be equal to its carrying value, including the goodwill.

US$300.0 million is also classified as falling due within one year.
A maturity analysis showing the ageing profile of the total borrowings is shown in note 17.
In the second quarter of the year, the group took advantage of favourable bank debt market conditions and low interest rates environment to refinance its US$695.0 million revolving credit and 316.4 million letters of credit facility.
The refinancing completed on 7 July and the new facility of US$2.5 billion was put in place.
The new facility has better economic terms, a lower coupon and flexibility to carve-out up to US$1 billion, for the issue of letters of credit.
The group has the ability to borrow in all major currencies and the maturity of the facility can be extended at the banks option for a further two years, after the initial five year maturity period.
At the year-end, the groups principal credit facilities comprised of: US$300.0 million term loan maturing in 2015, which was repaid in January 2015: US$150.0 million and 100.0 million term loans maturing in 2017: US$2.5 billion revolving and letters of credit facility maturing in 2019: US$576.0 million and 120.0 million senior loan notes maturing from 2018 to 2024: and 150.0 million of retail bonds maturing in 2020.
Financial Covenants Financial covenants are the same across all the groups borrowings except for 150.0 million retail bonds and US$245.3 million convertible bonds which have no financial covenants.
These financial covenants are tested on half-year annualised and full-year basis.
The financial covenants are as follows: Net debt up to 3 X EBITDAX Interest cover at least 4 X EBITDAX The company has financing in US$, and.
The and loans have been swapped into US$ at the transaction dates.
In total, 250.0 million and 120.0 million have been swapped into US$ using cross currency swap markets at an average exchange rate of US$1.64: and US$1.34: respectively.
However, all liabilities in currencies other than US$ have been translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the year-end.
Convertible bonds The bonds were issued on 1 November 2012, with a par value of US$245.3 million, exchange price of 4.34 US$7.00 at fixed exchange rate per share and a coupon of 2.5 per cent.
These are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 11 August 2016 until six days before their maturity date of 27 July 2018.
Under the terms, the exchange price is to be adjusted on the occurrence of certain events, including any payment of dividends by the company.
During the year, the company declared a dividend of 5 pence per Ordinary Share and consequently the exchange price was adjusted to 4.21, US$6.79 per share.
The total number of Ordinary Shares to be issued, if all bonds are converted at this adjusted exchange price is 36,117,351.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 July 2018.
Interest of 2.50 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.

The group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt.
The groups policy is to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent.
Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan notes, retail bonds and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for operated fields in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam.
The disposal relates predominantly to the sale of the groups interest in the Scott area assets in the UK North Sea.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, comprise accounts payable, bank loans, convertible bonds, retail bonds and senior loan notes.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the groups capital expenditure programme.
The group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable, loan to joint venture partner and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements 155 17.
Financial instruments continued Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The main risks that could adversely affect the groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with swaps, collar options, reverse collars and hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The groups exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
The group has and currency exposure as a result of the financial instruments.
These are managed through cross currency swap arrangements.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency such as Pound Sterling, Norwegian Kroner receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fair value hierarchy In line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2014, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans : Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2014: Oil forward sale contracts 241.0 241.0 Gas forward sale contracts 32.4 32.4 Total 273.4 273.4 2013: Gas forward sale contracts 0.4 0.4 Cross currency swap 2.6 2.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 12.9 12.9 Total 15.9 15.9 The above includes US$45.8 million in respect of oil and gas forward sale contracts which had expired by 31 December but had not yet cash settled.

The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$224.1 million credit 2013: US$27.2 million charge in retained earnings.
During the year, forward oil sales contracts for 5.6 million barrels matured generating an income of US$30.8 million 2013: US$1.3 million.
This income is an addition to sales revenues.
Indonesian gas At the year-end date, 84,000 mt of HSFO, which drives the groups gas pricing in Singapore, is subject to monthly forward sales contracts for 2015 at an average price of US$614.4 mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 222,000 mt expired, generating an income of US$15.2 million 2013: cash cost of US$2.2 million which has been included in the sales revenue.
All contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
In the current year there was no movement in the fair value of these contracts which was credited to the income statement 2013: US$0.2 million, relating to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The remaining movement, being a credit of US$26.0 million 2013: US$3.0 million, related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

Financial instruments continued Commodity contract sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million $ million $ million Ten per cent increase 31.4 1.9 33.3 Ten per cent decrease 31.4 1.9 33.3 Interest rate risk At 31 December 2014, US$300.0 million and 20.0 million of the groups long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are assessed as effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date.
The movement in fair values is shown in the table below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2013 16.8 Cash settlement for swaps 7.1 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 7.1 Credit to retained earnings for the year 6.4 At 31 December 2013 10.4 Cash settlement for swaps 7.3 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 7.3 Credit to retained earnings for the year 6.8 At 31 December 2014 3.6 Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest rates.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of 50 basis points in this variable: Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million Increase of fifty basis points 0.9 A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
158 Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 17.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exchange risk The group has issued 150.0 million retail bonds and 100.0 million term loan at a fixed exchange rate of US$1.64:, 25.0 million at fixed rate of US$1.328:, 75.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.423: and 20.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.34:.
All the above have been hedged under cross currency swaps into US dollars.
The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the reporting date is shown below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2013 6.4 Credit to retained earnings for the year 6.2 At 31 December 2013 0.2 Charge to retained earnings for the year 38.4 At 31 December 2014 38.6 To cover sterling exposures an amount of 777.2 million was purchased and matured with spot and forward contracts during the year 2013: 619.2 million to cater for its North Sea developments and operations.
The groups activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of any reasonably possible variation in foreign exchange rates on the groups results would be immaterial.
Other financial instruments Credit risk The groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits together with its long-term loan to the joint venture partner note 11.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2014 and 2013, with the exception of a US$61.2 million joint venture loan allowance in 2014 note 11.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from four customers each exceeded 10 per cent of the groups consolidated revenue in 2014 2013: four.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments.
Borrowing facilities The group has committed borrowing facilities of US$2,655.8 million 2013: US$1,661.0 and letter of credit facilities of US$450.0 million 2013: 316.4 million US$525.2 million, in addition to the convertible bonds, retail bonds and senior loan notes.
The undrawn cash balance from the committed borrowing facilities as at 31 December was: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Expiring in more than one year, but not more than two years 695.0 Expiring in more than two years, but not more than five years 1,425.0 280.0 The undrawn balance on the letter of credit facilities as at 31 December 2014 was US$242.0 million 2013: 118.6 million US$196.9 million which expires between one to five years.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the group as at 31 December excluding trade and other payables which are interest free was: Fixed rate weighted Fixed Floating average rate rate Total interest rate $ million $ million $ million % 2014: Bank loans 300.0 931.0 1,231.0 5.200 Convertible bonds 245.3 245.3 2.500 Senior loan notes 590.5 130.0 720.5 5.400 Retail bond 234.0 234.0 5.140 Total 1,369.8 1,061.0 2,430.8 2013: Bank loans 300.0 386.0 686.0 5.200 Convertible bonds 245.3 245.3 2.500 Senior loan notes 612.6 130.0 742.6 5.400 Retail bonds 249.0 249.0 5.140 Total 1,406.9 516.0 1,922.9 At 31 December 2014, US$300.0 million of the groups short-term bank borrowings and 20.0 million senior loan notes have been swapped from floating interest rates to fixed interest rates and are therefore included as a fixed rate liability in the table above 2013: US$300.0 million and 20.0 million.

The groups unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2014 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 Income Taxes the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2014 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances.
The corporate model used to determine the recognition of deferred tax assets was re-run, using an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in 2015 and 2016, and US$85 bbl in real terms thereafter.
The results of the corporate model demonstrated that it was no longer appropriate to recognise an amount of US$86.8 million in respect of the groups UK ring fence deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and allowances, principally due to fall in near term oil price assumptions.
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$263.1 million 2013: US$321.1 million and current year non-UK tax losses of US$40.8 million 2013: US$14.3 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses ring fence and non-ring fence have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax where certain conditions are satisfied.

Voting rights: the holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.
Purchase and cancellation of own shares During 2014, 18,455,248 Ordinary Shares have been repurchased and cancelled, representing 3.61 per cent of the companys issued share capital as at 31 December 2014.
The nominal value of the shares purchased and cancelled during the year is 2.3 million US$3.8 million and the aggregate amount of consideration paid by the company for those shares is 55.7 million US$93.0 million.
Share-based payments and share incentive plans The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the total cost recognised by the company for equity-settled share-based payment transactions is US$23.3 million 2013: US$24.6 million.
A credit of US$23.3 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2013: US$24.6 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore recharged to the relevant subsidiary undertaking where it is capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects, or is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: i Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 31.0% to 42.0% Risk free rate of interest: 1.0% to 2.9% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.32 to 0.35 Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements 163 19.
Share capital continued ii Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares.
If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares the company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of shares matching shares, on a one-for-one basis.
iii Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 500 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2014 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2014.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2014, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 24 July 2012.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per cent of the aggregate of members pensionable salaries.

The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2014 is 3.5 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2015 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
