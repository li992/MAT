SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups segments are aligned to the structure of business units based around core commodities.
Each business unit has a management team that is accountable to the Chief Executive, and in the instance of Copper, Nickel, Niobium and Phosphates, the same management team is responsible for the management of all four business units, collectively referred to as Base Metals and Minerals.
To align with changes in the management structure of the Groups coal businesses and the way their results are internally reported, Coal South Africa and Coal Colombia formerly the Thermal Coal segment and Coal Australia and Canada formerly the Metallurgical Coal segment are now reported together as the Coal segment.
Niobium and Phosphates are now reported as separate segments, having previously been aggregated and the Diamonds segment is now referred to as fide Beers.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the Iron Ore and Manganese segment on the basis of the ultimate product produced ferrous metals.
The Other Mining and Industrial segment is no longer considered to be individually significant to the Group and is therefore now shown within Corporate and other together with unallocated corporate costs and exploration costs.
Exploration costs represent the cost of the Groups exploration activities across all segments, and were previously reported separately.
The Group Management Committee evaluates the financial performance of the Group and its segments principally with reference to earnings before interest and tax underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is operating profit presented before special items and remeasurements and includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT of associates and joint ventures is the Groups attributable share of revenue less operating costs before special items and remeasurements of associates and joint ventures.
Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and joint operations and includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation.
Segment revenue includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures revenue.
Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows Iron Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys: Coal: metallurgical coal and thermal coal: Copper: copper: Nickel: nickel: Niobium: niobium: Phosphates: phosphates: Platinum: platinum group metals: and fide Beers: rough and polished diamonds.
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.

Refer to note 3 for the definition of underlying EBIT and changes in reporting segments.
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the directors consider to be a useful additional measure of the Groups performance.
Underlying earnings is profit for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company before special items and remeasurements and is therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests.
For a reconciliation from Loss for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company to Underlying earnings for the financial year, see note 9.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist inthe understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Such items are material by nature or amount to the years results and require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 97.
Special items that relate to the operating performance of the Group are classified as operating special items and principally include impairment charges, onerous contract provisions and restructuring costs.
Non-operating special items include costs in relation to closure of operations, profits and losses on disposals of investments and businesses as well as certain adjustments relating to business combinations.
Remeasurements comprise other items which the Group believes should be reported separately to aid an understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Remeasurements include: Unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting hedges related to financing arrangements.
Where the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are reversed from remeasurements and are recorded in underlying earnings in the same year as the underlying transaction for which the instruments provide the economic hedge.
If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the derivative.
Such amounts are classified in the income statement as operating when the underlying exposure is in respect of the operating performance of the Group and otherwise as financing.
Foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.
Such amounts are included within income tax expense.
The remeasurement and subsequent depreciation of a previously held equity interest as a result of a business combination.

Operating special items Minas-Rio The Minas-Rio iron ore project Minas-Rio Iron Ore and Manganese in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008.
Production commenced in the last quarter and successful delivery of First Ore On Ship FOOS was announced on 27 October 2014.
The project is currently ramping upto capacity of 26.5 Mtpa over the next 18-20 months, and work continues to progress on the regular cycle of required licence and permit renewals.
An impairment charge of $4,960 million before tax was recorded in 2012 against the carrying value of Minas-Rio.
This was based on the value in use of the cash generating unit CGU and reflected an increase in estimate of attributable project capital expenditure to $8.8 billion, including a $0.6 billion contingency as well as the impact of high inflation on operational costs.
The long term iron ore price used in the 2012 valuation was within the range of published analyst forecasts.
The successful progress of the project up to delivery of FOOS indicates that the $0.6 billion of contingency will not be fully utilised and consequently total capital expenditure for the project now is estimated at $8.4 billion, on an attributable basis.
In 2014, a material worsening of the pricing environment for iron ore has been in evidence, driven by revisions to the outlook for global GDP growth, especially in the context of weaker Chinese construction activity, whilst atthe same time supply from Western Australia has ramped up to outstrip weakening demand.
The value in use of Minas-Rio has been updated to reflect managements best estimate of the future iron ore prices based on a detailed analysis of market fundamentals in the medium and long term.
The long term price which is used in the valuation from 2024 onwards is within the range of published analyst forecasts and broadly in line with the mean.
The valuation of Minas-Rio at 31 December 2014 determined on a pre-tax discounted cash flow basis real pre-tax discount rate of 8.5% is $5.6 billion.
Basedon this valuation, the Group has recorded an impairment charge of $3,800 million before tax against the carrying value of the CGU.
Of this charge, $971million has been recorded against mining properties and $2,829 million against capital works in progress, with an associated deferred tax credit of $320million.
The post-tax impairment charge is $3,480 million.
The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in long term prices may result in additional impairment.
124 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT 6.
SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued Coal In September 2014, the Group announced that it had decided, in view of the subdued hard coking coal price environment, to place Peace River Coal in British Columbia, Canada on care and maintenance to preserve the long term future of the operation.
The recoverable amount of the Peace River Coal CGU has been assessed based on the operations fair value less costs of disposal, measured using discounted cash flow projections see note 1.
Despite the decision to place the operation on care and maintenance, the decrease in hard coking coal prices has driven a decrease in the valuation of Peace River Coal to $0.1 billion.
Based on this valuation, the Group has recorded an impairment charge of $265 million before tax against the carrying value of the CGU.
The post-tax impairment charge is also $265 million.
Of this charge, $124 million has been recorded against plant and equipment, $123 million against mining properties and the remainder against capital works in progress.
The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in the pricing outlook may result in additional impairment.
The long term hard coking coal price used in the valuation from 2019 onwards is within the range of published analyst forecasts and broadly in line with the mean.
The remaining $98 million of the impairment charge recognised in special items $69 million after tax relates to other Coal assets in Australia.
Platinum The charge of $44 million relates to the closure of the declines at the Union operation in the Platinum business.
The charge after tax and non-controlling interests is $21 million.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs of $128 million principally relate to organisational changes as part of the Driving Value programme 2013: $177 million of which $146million related tothe implementation of the Platinum portfolio review.
Restructuring costs after tax and non-controlling interests amount to $93million.
2013 Operating special items in 2013 principally comprised impairments and related charges in respect of the Barro Alto nickel project Nickel, the Platinum portfolio review, the Michiquillay copper project Copper, and the Foxleigh, Isibonelo and Kleinkopje coal operations Coal.
Operating special items in 2013 also included charges relating to onerous contract provisions, principally at Callide Coal, the reversal on sale of fair value uplifts recognised on inventories as part of the fide Beers acquisition accounting, and costs associated with the Platinum portfolio review.
Operating remeasurements Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $1 million 2013: $550 million which principally comprises gains of $136 million in respect of derivatives related to capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil offset by a $129 million depreciation and amortisation charge 2013: $131 million arising due to the fair value uplift on the pre-existing 45% shareholding in fide Beers, which was required on acquisition of a controlling stake.
Derivatives in relation to Iron Ore Brazil which have been realised during the period had a cumulative net operating remeasurement loss of $140 million 2013:$137 million since their inception.
Non-operating special items A charge of $222 million $155 million after tax has been recognised following the decision by the New South Wales Planning Assessment Committee PAC not to approve the Groups application to proceed with the Drayton South project Coal.
The reserves of the existing Drayton operation are expected to be depleted during 2015 and the Drayton South project would have extended the life of the operation by approximately 27 years.
Management is preparing a revised application for the project, to be submitted in the first half of 2015, and continues to work to allow operations to continue at Drayton.
However, in view ofthe uncertainty caused by the PAC decision, assets associated with the project and the existing operation have been written down to their residual values, and a provision has been made for the cost of meeting contractual and other obligations beyond the life of the existing Drayton mine.
A $46 million charge has been recognised primarily in relation to the revaluation of deferred contingent consideration for the disposal of Amap in 2013 Corporate and other.
The contingent consideration receivable is calculated on the basis of the market price for iron ore, which has seen a material worsening.
In November 2014, fide Beers concluded the refinancing of its Black Economic Empowerment partner, Ponahalo Investments RF Proprietary Limited Ponahalo, which owns a 26% share in fide Beers principal South African subsidiary, fide Beers Consolidated Mines DBCM.
The refinancing extended the period over which Ponahalo may repay borrowings that were used to finance the purchase of its share in DBCM in 2006 by seven years.
Acharge of $58 million has been recognised and no tax arises in relation to this transaction.
The Kumba Envision Trust charge of $44 million 2013: $54 million relates to Kumbas Iron Ore and Manganese broad based employee share scheme provided solely for the benefit of non-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees who do not participate in other Kumba share schemes.
2013 Non-operating special items in 2013 principally relate to the loss on disposal of Amap, the Groups exit from the Pebble project in Alaska Copper, the loss recognised on the formation of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture Corporate and other, the Kumba Envision Trust charge, the gain on deferred proceeds of undeveloped coal assets in Australia Coal and the gain on disposal of the Groups interest in Palabora Mining Company Limited Corporate and other.
Financing special items and remeasurements Financing special items and remeasurements reflect a net gain of $36 million 2013: net loss of $130 million principally comprising gains on derivatives relating to debt.
Special items and remeasurements tax Total special items and remeasurements tax relating to subsidiaries and joint operations amounts to a credit of $2 million 2013: $587 million.
This includes one-off tax charges of $105 million 2013: $188 million, tax credits on special items and remeasurements of $412 million 2013: $902 million and tax remeasurement charges of $305 million 2013: $127 million.
One-off tax charges of $105 million comprise a $100 million charge for the derecognition of deferred tax assets at Peace River Coal Coal, a $61 million charge for the derecognition of a deferred tax asset in Coal Australia relating to the Mineral Resource Rent Tax which was repealed in 2014, and a $56 million credit for the recognition of a deferred tax asset in Barro Alto.
Of the total tax credit of $2 million 2013: $587 million, $31 million relates to a current tax credit 2013: charge of $159 million and $29 million relates to adeferred tax charge 2013: credit of $746 million.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE continued b Factors affecting tax charge for the year The effective tax rate for the year of 488.4 % 2013: 74.9% is lower 2013: higher than the applicable weighted average statutory rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 21.5% 2013: 23.25%.

Associates and joint ventures tax is therefore not included within the Groups income tax expense.
Associates and joint ventures tax included within Share of net income from associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2014 is $159million 2013:$155million.
Excluding special items and remeasurements this becomes $113million 2013: $158 million.
The effective tax rate before special items and remeasurements including attributable share of associates and joint ventures tax for the year ended 31December 2014 was 29.8%.
This is lower than the equivalent effective tax rate of 32.0% for the year ended 31 December 2013 due to the impact of certain prior year adjustments, the remeasurement of withholding tax provisions across the Group and the recognition of previously unrecognised losses.
In future periods it is expected that the effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

Total dividends paid during the year were $1,099 million 2013: $1,078 million.
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of 53 US cents per share.
This will result in an estimated distribution of $678 million of shareholders funds, of which $421 million will be distributed by the parent company.
These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable as it is still subject to shareholder approval.
The employee benefit trust has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds see note 32.

Of these, $517 million 2013: $517 million have indefinite useful lives.
2 Includes $19 million 2013: $20 million of amortisation arising due to the fair value uplift of the Groups pre-existing 45% shareholding in fide Beers.
This has been included within operating remeasurements see note 6.
Impairment tests for goodwill See note 39f for the Groups accounting policy on impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
This allocation largely represents the Groups segments.
Any goodwill associated with CGUs subsumed within these segments is not significant when compared to the goodwill of the Group.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups ofCGUs is as follows: US$ million 2014 2013 Coal South Africa 88 88 Copper 124 124 Platinum 230 230 fide Beers 1,895 2,056 Other 216 170 2,553 2,668 For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal basis.
The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

In 2013, an additional $126million was recognised as an expense within operating special items relating to the reversal of fair value uplifts on fide Beers inventory.
Inventories held at net realisable value amounted to $1,014 million 2013: $308 million.
Write-down of inventories net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases amounted to $153 million 2013: $58 million.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39a, net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.

Of the year end trade receivables balance, $61 million 2013: $65 million were past due at 31 December, stated after an associated impairment provision of $30 million 2013: $19million.
The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions, and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts areconsidered recoverable.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade payables are not interest bearing and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of amounts relating to purchases of provisionally priced concentrate which are marked to market using the appropriate forward price until settled.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS See notes 39m and 39n for the Groups accounting policies on impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are as shown below.
Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not approximate its fair value, this is also disclosed.
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

Trade and other payables exclude tax and social security and deferred income.
2 Derivative instruments are analysed between those which are Held for trading and those designated into hedge relationships in note 19.
3 Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt.
The fair value of these borrowings is $15,339 million 2013: $14,907 million, which is based on the quoted market price andconsequently categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
For the majority of borrowings at amortised cost the carrying value is considered to approximate the fair value.
In certain circumstances the fair value of borrowings at amortised cost is based on managements estimates of future cash flows and consequently the valuation is categorised as level 3 in the fair valuehierarchy.

This category includes listed equity shares.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of certain cross currency swaps of Brazilian real denominated borrowings whose valuation depends upon regulated interest rates, contingent proceeds and related receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows: Assets Liabilities US$ million 2014 2013 2014 2013 At 1 January 225 107 456 216 1 Net loss gain recorded in the income statement 7 134 43 195 Net loss gain recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 6 2 Currency movements 5 18 45 At 31 December 207 225 499 456 1 This is principally recorded in special items and remeasurements.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.
134 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 19.
DERIVATIVES See note 39n for the Groups accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the date of expected settlement of the derivative.
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as Held for trading and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges.
Where this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the Consolidated income statement or hedged balance sheet item.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Net investment hedges In certain instances, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge exposures in non-US dollar functional subsidiaries to exchange rate fluctuations on USdollar denominated borrowings.
These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and principally relate to the Groups Australian coal operations.
Fair value changes in these derivatives are recognised within the cumulative translation adjustment reserve and recycled upon disposal of the related subsidiary.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements and are classified as financing or operating depending on the nature of the associated hedged risk.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative position at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities is as follows: Current Non-current 2014 2013 2014 2013 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt 1 Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 15 8 617 27 354 138 Net investment hedge Forward foreign currency contracts 347 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 51 10 18 86 Cross currency swaps 38 386 24 15 21 1,750 248 919 Interest rate swaps 2 104 396 50 101 985 1,777 602 1,059 2 Other derivatives 43 143 20 271 1 8 2 80 Total derivatives 147 539 70 372 986 1,785 604 1,139 1 Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $440 million 2013: gain of $555 million, partly offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of $381million 2013: loss of $474 million.
2 Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure that are accounted for as Held for trading.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at year end, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
For more information about these risks and the ways in which the Group manages them see notes 24 and 38.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on managements best estimate of the legal and constructive obligations incurred.
These estimates reflect industry best practice and currently applicable legislation.
Significant changes in legislation could result in changes in provisions recognised.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Decommissioning Provision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work.
Employee benefits Provision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements including long service leave, annual leave, sickness pay and similar obligations.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.
Onerous contracts Provision is made for the present value of certain long term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Groups obligations is expected to exceed the benefits to be received.
It is anticipated these costs will be incurred over a period of up to 16 years.
Other Other provisions primarily relate to restructuring costs, indemnities, legal and other claims.
It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a five yearperiod.
Environmental rehabilitation trusts The Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities, primarily in South Africa.
The funds comprise the following investments: US$ million 2014 2013 Equity 139 149 Bonds 155 134 Cash 64 65 358 348 These assets are primarily denominated in South African rand.
Cash is held in short term fixed deposits or earns interest at floating inter-bank rates.
Bonds earn interest at aweighted average fixed rate of 8.2% 2013: 8.2% for an average period of four years 2013: five years.
Equity investments are recorded at fair value through profit and loss and bonds are recorded at amortised cost.
These funds are not available for the general purposes of the Group.
All income from these assets is reinvested to meet specific environmental obligations.
These obligations are included in provisions stated above.

All of these credits expire within three months.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Groups retained earnings and amounted to $17,488million 2013: $19,117 million.

NET DEBT See note 39o for the Groups accounting policy on cash and debt.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups financial position.
The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and uses of financial resources, the availability of capital to invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the balance sheet.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt, see note 19. a Reconciliation to the balance sheet Medium and Cash and cash equivalents Short term borrowings long term borrowings US$ million 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Balance sheet 6,748 7,704 1,618 2,108 16,917 15,740 Bank overdrafts 1 2 1 2 Net debt classifications 6,747 7,702 1,617 2,106 16,917 15,740 b Movement in net debt Cash Medium and Net debt Derivatives Net debt and cash Short term long term excluding hedging including US$ million equivalents borrowings borrowings derivatives net debt derivatives At 1 January 2013 9,298 2,490 15,150 8,342 168 8,510 Cash flow 1,235 2,307 3,279 2,207 181 2,388 Disposal of businesses 69 69 69 Reclassifications 2,084 2,084 Movement in fair value 24 521 545 155 390 Other non-cash movements 5 39 44 44 Currency movements 361 73 123 165 4 169 At 31 December 2013 7,702 2,106 15,740 10,144 508 10,652 Cash flow 841 1,785 3,568 2,624 203 2,827 Reclassifications 1,487 1,487 Movement in fair value 7 434 441 373 814 Other non-cash movements 2 72 74 74 Currency movements 114 200 1,410 1,496 1,496 At 31 December 2014 6,747 1,617 16,917 11,787 1,084 12,871 c Net debt by segment The Groups policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre.
Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group.
Other than the impact of South African exchange controls see 23d below, there are no significant restrictions over the Groups ability to access these cash balances or repay these borrowings.
Net debt by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances.
d South Africa net debt The Group operates in South Africa where the existence of exchange controls may restrict the use of certain cash balances.
The Group therefore monitors the cash and debt associated with these operations separately.
These restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups ability to meet its ongoing obligations.
Below is a breakdown of net debt in South Africa.
US$ million 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents 1,298 2,247 Short term borrowings 118 512 Medium and long term borrowings 1,252 1,000 Net debt cash excluding derivatives 72 735 Derivatives hedging net debt 1 4 Net debt cash including derivatives 71 739 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 139 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH FLOW STATEMENT, NET DEBT AND RELATED NOTES 24.
BORROWINGS See note 39o for the Groups accounting policy on bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, the South African Domestic Medium Term Note DMTN programme, the Australian Medium Term Note AMTN programme and through accessing the United States US bond markets.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Groups borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
During 2014, the Group issued corporate bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $3.2 billion.
These included the following bonds: 750 million 1.75% guaranteed loan notes due 2018 and 750 million 3.25% guaranteed loan notes due 2023 issued under the EMTN programme.
$500 million LIBOR plus 0.95% senior floating rate notes due 2016 and $500 million 4.125% senior notes due 2021 through accessing the US bond markets.
R650 million 9.49% senior notes due 2021 and R400 million JIBAR plus 1.47% floating rate notes due 2021 issued under the DMTN programme.
Related to these assets are borrowings of $30 million 2013: $41 million.
2 Details of assets held under finance leases are provided in note 12.

BORROWINGS continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2014 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,602 752 175 3,387 5,916 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,866 670 101 2,637 Greater than two years, less than three years 2,806 581 47 3,434 Greater than three years, less than four years 3,555 489 277 4,321 Greater than four years, less than five years 2,053 320 44 2,329 Greater than five years 6,094 556 201 6,851 Total due for repayment after more than one year 16,374 2,616 582 19,572 Total 17,976 3,368 757 3,387 25,488 2013 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 2,098 762 245 4,204 6,819 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,903 720 19 2,604 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,532 540 67 2,005 Greater than three years, less than four years 2,872 470 165 3,177 Greater than four years, less than five years 2,642 417 58 3,001 Greater than five years 6,580 581 476 6,685 Total due for repayment after more than one year 15,529 2,728 785 17,472 Total 17,627 3,490 1,030 4,204 24,291 The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December: US$ million 2014 2013 Expiry date 1 Within one year 1,073 1,318 Greater than one year, less than two years 525 637 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,172 1,449 Greater than three years, less than four years 597 Greater than four years, less than five years 5,000 5,847 8,367 9,251 1 Includes undrawn rand facilities equivalent to $0.9 billion 2013: $1.2 billion in respect of facilities with 364 day maturity which roll automatically on a daily basis, unless notice is served.
In April 2014, the Group amended a $5 billion revolving credit facility, extending the maturity to 2019.
The facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2014.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to enable the business to operate effectively.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group has a number of options including raising and refinancing debt, adjusting returns to equity shareholders, managing the allocation of capital and divesting of non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital using various financial metrics including the ratio of net debt to total capital gearing.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt.
Total capital is calculated as Net assets as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet excluding net debt.
Total capital and gearing are as follows: US$ million 2014 2013 Net assets 32,177 37,364 Net debt including related derivatives note 23 12,871 10,652 Total capital 45,048 48,016 Gearing 28.6% 22.2% Gearing has increased from 22.2% to 28.6% as net debt has increased and total capital has decreased.
Net debt increased from $10.7 billion to $12.9 billion at 31December 2014 as cash inflows from operating activities were offset by outflows primarily relating to capital expenditure and dividends to Anglo American plc shareholders as well as to non-controlling interests.
Total capital decreased from $48.0 billion to $45.0 billion primarily due to the impact of impairments and the effect of a stronger US dollar on assets denominated in other currencies.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH FLOW STATEMENT, NET DEBT AND RELATED NOTES 24.
BORROWINGS continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values and related cash flows will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The Group manages interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South Africa.
For more information regarding the Groups financial risk management see note 38.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS See note 39t for the Groups accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
It also operates post employment medical plans, principally inSouth Africa.
Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised was $244million 2013: $261 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $81million 2013: $88 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of segments.
The most significant plans are in South Africa and the UnitedKingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows: US$ million 2014 2013 Net liability recognised at 1 January 1,013 1,233 Net income statement charge 113 88 Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation 15 97 Employer contributions 132 151 Other 31 10 Currency movements 89 70 Net liability recognised at 31 December 889 1,013 Amounts recognised as: 1 Defined benefit pension plans in surplus 184 191 Retirement benefit obligation pension plans 615 727 Retirement benefit obligation medical plans 458 477 889 1,013 1 Included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and are principally in South Africa.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2014.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believe the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans The defined benefit plans are exposed to risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchangerisk.
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 12 years 2013: 12 years, United Kingdom plans is 18years 2013: 19 years and plans in other regions is 14 years 2013: 14 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year.
Employer contributions made in the year ended 31December 2014 were $132million topension plans and in addition $27 million of benefits were paid in relation to post employment medical plans.
The Group expects to contribute $134 million toits pension plans and $25million to its post employment medical plans in 2015.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund.
All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are closed to new members.
The only plan still open to future benefit accrual will close to accrual on 30 September 2015.
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of investment strategies, including the use of interest rate hedging and inflation hedging to manage interest rate risk and inflation rate risk respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any resulting surplus has been assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.
144 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION 27.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
The features of this provision meet the definition of a post employment benefit obligation and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet.
Other plans are in Brazil, Canada and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans.
These plans are not considered to be significant tothe Group.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2014 2013 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 8.3% 3.6% 6.4% 8.8% 4.4% 7.3% Average rate of inflation 6.2% 3.1% 3.5% 6.4% 3.4% 3.5% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 6.2% 3.2% 3.2% 6.4% 3.3% 3.4% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 8.3% 3.9% 7.0% 8.8% 4.3% 8.1% Average rate of inflation 6.2% 3.3% 5.2% 6.4% 3.4% 5.7% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 7.9% 8.0% 7.7% 8.2% 8.1% 8.1% Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
In South Africa, the PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use either SAPS tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2014 2013 2014 2013 South Africa 19.9 19.8 24.6 24.6 United Kingdom 28.7 28.7 30.2 30.2 Other 22.8 22.7 27.1 27.0 The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female age 45 at the balance sheet date.
When viewed together with the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2014 2013 2014 2013 South Africa 19.9 19.8 24.6 24.6 United Kingdom 29.7 29.7 31.9 32.0 Other 23.3 23.2 27.5 27.3 Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.

Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market.
Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market.
These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA.
Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $4.69 per share to Epoch, $7.29 per share to Epoch Two and $6.05 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party.
These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies.
The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares.
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax ofEpoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts.
TheInvestment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2014 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 2013: 112,300,129 Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.0% 2013:8.1% of the ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares with a market value of $2,100 million 2013: $2,451 million.

Kumba Iron Ore 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights Sishen Iron Ore Company Pty Limited SIOC has not yet been awarded the 21.4% Sishen mining right, which it applied for early in 2014 following the Constitutional Court judgment on the matter in December 2013.
The Constitutional Court ruled that SIOC held a 78.6% undivided share of the Sishen mining right and that, based on the provisions of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act MPRDA, only SIOC can apply for, and be granted, the residual 21.4% share of the mining right at the Sishen mine.
The grant of the mining right may be made subject to such conditions considered by the minister to be appropriate, provided that the proposed conditions are permissible under the MPRDA.
Kumba Iron Ore is actively continuing its discussions with the Department of Mineral Resources DMR in order to finalise the grant of the residual right.
Kumba Iron Ore tax At 31 December 2014, Kumba Iron Ore has certain unresolved tax matters that are currently under review with the South African Revenue Service SARS.
Kumba Iron Ore management has consulted with external tax and legal advisers, who support the positions taken.
Nonetheless, Kumba Iron Ore management is actively discussing the issue with SARS with a view to seeking resolution and believes that the accounting for these matters is appropriate in the results for the year ended 31 December 2014.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is as follows subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Market risks a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay for its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: US$ million 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents 6,747 7,702 1 Trade and other receivables 2,465 3,874 2 Financial asset investments 761 759 Derivative financial assets 1,133 674 11,106 13,009 1 Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables.
2 Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity in case of relationship banks and fund size in case of asset managers.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, and the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 155 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 38.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued b Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2014 2013 Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity 1 2 1 2 US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 498 649 12,590 11,443 1,261 678 10,946 9,007 Derivatives 3 1,194 1,191 3 834 837 501 649 13,784 12,634 1,258 678 11,780 9,844 1 Includes provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
2 Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are settled through physical delivery of the Groups production or are used within the production process are classified as normal purchase or sale contracts and are not marked to market.
c Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Groups underlying earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Net otherfinancial assets excluding net debt related balances are $237 million.
This includes net assets of $510 million which are denominated in US dollar, $158million in Brazilian real and $42 million in South African rand, partially offset by net liabilities of $331 million which are denominated in Chilean peso and $223 million in Australian dollar.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities.
The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.
Strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Of net other financial assets excluding net debt related balances of $237 million, the majority are non-interest bearing.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued e Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December to changes in foreign currencies, commodity prices and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December.
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: all income statement sensitivities also impact equity for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed materially to offset one another all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant commodity price.
2014 2013 US$ million Income Equity Income Equity 1 Foreign currency sensitivities 10% US dollar to rand 61 61 16 16 10% US dollar to rand 61 61 16 16 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 154 154 167 167 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 154 154 155 155 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 30 30 37 37 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 30 30 37 37 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 36 36 30 30 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 40 40 32 32 Commodity price sensitivities 10% increase in the copper price 103 103 109 109 10% decrease in the copper price 103 103 109 109 10% increase in the platinum price 21 21 15 15 10% decrease in the platinum price 21 21 15 15 Interest rate sensitivity 3 50bps increase in LIBOR 4 4 7 7 3 50bps decrease in LIBOR 4 4 7 7 1 represents strengthening of US dollar against the respective currency.
2 Includes sensitivities for derivatives related to capital expenditure.
3 Without the impact of capitalised interest, the Groups sensitivity to a 50bps increase and decrease in LIBOR would be $49 million 2013: $44 million loss and gain respectively.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including: fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year fluctuating cash balances changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Groups sales and operating costs, which are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates.
In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
