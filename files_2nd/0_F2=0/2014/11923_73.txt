Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan in the UK, which is sectionalised to provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pension benefits.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 November 2006.
The defined contribution section, opened in 2003, is open to new and existing employees.
Finally, there is a separate section within the UK Group plan set up for auto-enrolment.
The defined benefit section of the UK Group plan is a final salary pension plan which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits depends on the length of service and final pensionable pay.
The UK Group plan is funded with benefit payments from trustee administered funds.
The UK Group plan is administered inaccordance with the Trust Deed and Rules in the interests of its beneficiaries by Pearson Group Pension TrusteeLimited.
At 31 December 2014 the UK Group plan has approximately 26,500 members, analysed in the following table: % Active Deferred Pensioners total Defined benefit 2 25 32 59 Defined contribution 18 23 41 total 20 48 32 100 OUR BUSINESS OUR pERfORmaNcE OUR SOcIal Impact GOvERNaNcE fINaNcIal StatEmENtS Section 5 Financial statements 177 25.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Background continued The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
These are also final salary pension plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed pension payable for life, with the level of benefits dependent on length of service and final pensionable pay.
The majority of the US plans are funded.
The Group also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as life expectancy, inflation risks, and investment risk including asset volatility and changes in bond yields.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2014 2013 UK Group Other UK Group Other % plan plans PRmB plan plans PRMB Inflation 3.0 2.5 2.5 3.4 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.6 3.7 3.7 4.4 4.4 4.4 Expected rate of increase in salaries 3.5 3.9 4.0 3.9 3.9 4.0 Expected rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 1.9 to 5.05 2.3 to 5.1 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 7.0 7.5 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.0 5.0 The UK discount rate is based on corporate bond yields adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The inflation rate for the UK Group plan of 3.0% reflects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation in 2010, certain benefits have been calculated with reference to CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.0% has been used.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 3.5% for 2014 with a short-term assumption of 2.0% forthreeyears.
For the UK plan, the mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to reflect the observed experience of the plan, with CMI model improvement factors.
A 1.5% long-term rate improvement on the CMI model is applied for males, and 1.25% for females.
For the US plans, the mortality table RP 2014 and 2014 Improvement scale MP 2014 with no adjustments have been adopted for 2014, reflecting the mortality assumption most prevalent in the US.
In 2013 the RP2000 table projected to 2020 was used.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Assumptions continued Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK Group plan and US plans is as follows: UK US 2014 2013 2014 2013 Male 24.4 24.3 21.6 19.2 Female 24.5 24.4 23.8 21.1 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 15 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2014 2013 2014 2013 Male 26.6 25.9 23.3 19.2 Female 26.4 25.9 25.5 21.1 Although the Group anticipates that plan surpluses will be utilised during the life of the plan to address member benefits, the Group recognises its pension surplus in full in respect of the UK Group plan on the basis that it is managements judgement that there are no substantive restrictions on the return of residual plan assets in the event of a winding up of the plan after all member obligations have been met.

The trustee of the plan is required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
Assets of the plan are divided into two elements: matching assets, which are assets that produce cash flows that can be expected to match the cash flows for a proportion of the membership, and include UK and overseas bonds, inflation linked property and infrastructure: return seeking assets, which are assets invested with a longer-term horizon to generate the returns needed to provide the remaining expected cash flows for the beneficiaries, and include equities, property and alternative asset classes.
The benchmark allocation is 60% matching and 40% return seeking assets.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2012 and this valuation revealed a funding shortfall.
The Group has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by June 2017.
In 2014 the Group contributed 43m 2013: 56m towards the funding shortfall.
Following the completion of the triennial funding valuation the Group has agreed to contribute 41m per annum until 2017 in excess of regular contributions.
In addition, a mechanism has been agreed for the Group to make supplementary payments up to a maximum of 15m per annum if certain conditions are met.
If such payments are made they are expected to accelerate the end date for extinguishing the deficit.
Regular contributions to the plan in respect of the defined benefit sections are estimated to be 17m for 2015.
The Group expects to contribute $10m in 2015 and $11m in 2016 to its US defined benefit pension plans.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Sensitivities The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2014 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 371 467 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 19 22 The effect of members living one year more or one year less on the defined benefit obligation is as follows: 2014 1 year 1 year All figures in millions increase decrease Effect: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 88 85 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan 7 6 The effect of a half percentage point increase and decrease in the inflation rate is as follows: 2014 All figures in millions 0.5% increase 0.5% decrease Effect: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 111 104 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, although in practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating these sensitivities the same method has been applied to calculate the defined benefit obligation as has been applied when calculating the liability recognised in the balance sheet.
This methodology is the same as prior periods.
