68 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Annual report on remuneration This section of the report deals with the operation of the Groups remuneration policies in the course of 2014 and how the Committee intends to apply the Directors remuneration policy in 2015.
On listing, the Committee decided to adopt aremuneration structure for Executive Directors comprising the TSB Award with an ontarget annual award of 10% of basic salary and the SPA with an ontarget annual award of 62.5% of annual basic salary.
TheCommittee believes that this combination significantly reduces the risk of incentivising short term gain at the expense of longer term sustainability.
Executive Directors variable pay awards in aggregate are limited to 100% of fixed pay calculated in accordance with the applicable Remuneration Code provisions which further reduces the risk of over incentivising short term gain.
However, overall compensation needs to remain competitive and the Committee therefore decided to increase the basic salary for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer at listing, as astep towards reflecting the new remuneration structure and their additional responsibilities as Main Board Directors of alisted Company.
Upon careful consideration and as afurther step to ensuring acompetitive total compensation package, afurther increase will be implemented for the Chief Financial Officer from 1 April 2015 as set out in the section Implementation of remuneration policy in 2015.
As part of this transition the TSB Award is based on service from the date of listing, whilst the Legacy LBG Award, although determined by the Committee and payable by TSB, is based on the variable pay structure and basic salary in place in 2014 prior to listing.

4 Mark Fisher is aNon-executive Director of TSB and as such is not eligible to participate in any TSB incentive schemes.
Prior to his appointment as Non-executive Director of TSB he was employed by LBG and received awards under the LBG Long Term Incentive Plan, subject to the achievement of LBG performance measures.
Prior to joining TSB, he entered into an arrangement with LBG whereby the vesting of aportion of his outstanding LBG awards under the LBG Long Term Incentive Plan would be subject to his acting as LBGs Appointee Director on the Board of TSB as well as achievement of the original LBG performance measures.
As at the date of publication of this Report, TSB has not been informed by LBG of the proportion of the 2012 Long Term Incentive award that will vest.
Assuming amaximum estimate of the vesting i. e. 100% vesting, the proportion of the award that vests by reference to his appointment as Nonexecutive Director of TSB is estimated to be 728,293.
The award will be wholly settled by LBG at no cost to TSB.

Under the TSB remuneration arrangements, the first awards under the SPA will be granted in early 2015, based on performance achieved in 2014.
Awards will vest in five tranches, subject to the achievement of corporate and individual release conditions over the next five years, and will be included in future years single figures accordingly.

Details of performance measures and targets for these awards have not been disclosed in this report given they relate to adifferent entity and the commercial sensitivities arising.
As at the date of publication of this Report, TSB has not been informed by LBG of the proportion of the award that will vest.
As such, the figures are based on amaximum estimate of the vesting value i. e. assuming 100% vesting of the awards and valued at an average LBG share price to 31 December 2014 as prescribed by the regulations.
The estimated value has been split between the different time periods based on qualifying services to each entity over the three year performance period.
The values will be revised in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report based on actual vesting levels and share price on the date of vesting.

The calculation of the 1:1capis determined according to the relevant regulatory requirements.
The calculation of fixed pay includes basic salary, pension contribution, flex allowance and car allowance.
Variable pay includes any TSB Award and any SPA award.
Because of the deferred nature of the SPA the initial award value is discounted in line with the regulations when calculating the cap.
