NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 25.
Pension schemes Defined benefit pension scheme The Group acquired a defined benefit final salary pension scheme during 2009, which is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual on 30 June 2004.
Pension costs are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2013.
This valuation was updated to the year end.
Plan assets are stated at fair value at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
Restatement of comparatives IAS 19 revised includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal impact on the Group of the application of this standard is that interest on pension scheme assets is now calculated by reference to the liability discount rate rather than the expected long-term yield on the assets, as was the case previously.
The impact of the amendment on profit before tax for the prior year ended 31 March 2013 was to increase finance costs by 135,000, with a resulting reduction of 0.2 pence in both earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share.
There was no impact on the reported pension liability as the impact on the income statement is mitigated by an offsetting adjustment in the calculation of actuarial gains and losses in the statement of comprehensive income.

At 31 March 2014, the average duration of the scheme liabilities was 23 years 2013: 23 years.
For deferred pensions the average duration was 24 years 2013: 24 years and for pensions in payment the average duration was twelve years 2013: twelve years.
The Groups deficit as measured under IFRIC 14 is 6,528,000 as a result of the Groups commitment to future contributions to the scheme.
This compares to an underlying IAS 19 deficit of 3,071,000.
As a result, the liabilities in the scheme are only sensitive to a reasonable change in the discount rate assumption.
A 0.5 per cent increase decrease in the discount rate would give rise to a 83,000 decrease 85,000 increase in the deficit at 31 March 2014.
The scheme rules require the pension benefits to be uplifted by Retail Price Index RPI, so there was no financial effect from the statutory requirement to uplift pension benefits by Consumer Price index CPI rather than RPI.

The plan has not invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments nor in any properties or other assets used by the Group.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 1,320,000 to the scheme during the year ending 31 March 2015 in respect of regular contributions and intends to contribute the same amount annually through to November 2019.
The risks to which the plan exposes the entity have been minimised by investing the assets of the scheme across a broad range of return seeking funds and debt instruments.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes whereby contributions are made to schemes operated by major insurance companies.
Contributions to these schemes are determined as a percentage of employees earnings.
Contributions owing to the insurance companies at the year end, included in trade and other payables, amounted to 238,000 2013: 134,000.
Contributions during the year totalled 1,460,000 2013: 1,137,000.
