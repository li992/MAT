Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 55 1| Summary of significant accounting policies General information The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. is a public company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 46.
The groups operations and its principal activities are as an investment trust and the provider of independent fiduciary services.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. and the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies SORP is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements necessarily requires the exercise of judgement both in application of accounting policies which are set out below and in the selection of assumptions used in the calculation of estimates.
These estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The most significantly affected component of the financial statements and associated critical judgements is as follows: Defined benefit scheme The calculation of the deficit of the defined benefit scheme is sensitive to the assumptions used.
The assumptions used are given in note 23 to the financial statements.
The sensitivity to changes in assumptions and conditions which are significant to the calculation of the deficit have been considered and the following is an illustration of the potential impact.
Increase decrease in liability at 31 December 2014 million Discount rate 0.1% 0.9 Inflation assumptions 0.1% 0.5 Life expectancy at 65 1 year 1.4 RPI CPI gap 0.8% instead of 1.0% 0.4 The directors take advice from an actuary when selecting assumptions.
New IFRSs, interpretations and amendments not yet effective None of the new standards, interpretations or amendments, which are effective for the first time in these financial statements has had a material impact on the financial statements.
None of the new standards, interpretations or amendments, endorsed but not yet effective are expected to have a material impact on the groups future financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. and entities controlled by the Corporation its subsidiaries made up to the end of the financial period.
Control is achieved where the Corporation has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 56 Notes to the accounts continued 1| Summary of significant accounting policies continued The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are adjusted, where necessary, to ensure the accounting policies used are consistent with those adopted by the group.
Presentation of income statement and statement of comprehensive income In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the SORP, supplementary information which analyses the income statement and statement of comprehensive income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the groups compliance with certain requirements set out in Sections 1158-1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Corporation has not presented its own income statement, however its profit for the year was 21,930,000 2013: 134,521,000.
Segment reporting Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the directors in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The group comprises two operating segments: the investment trust and independent fiduciary services.
This is consistent with internal reporting.
Foreign currencies Transactions recorded in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Gains and losses on translation are included in profit or loss for the period, however exchange gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss are included as part of their fair value gain or loss.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the assets estimated useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements over the remaining lease period Office furniture and equipment 3-10 years Intangible assets Computer software Computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment would be recognised in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. www.
com 57 1| Summary of significant accounting policies continued Impairment of assets An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Assets are reviewed on a regular basis and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Financial instruments Investments Listed investments, which comprise the investment trust portfolio, have been designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Purchases and sales of listed investments are recognised on trade date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the investment.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from listed investments, as assets at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date.
The quoted market price used is the bid price.
Gains and losses on investments and direct transaction costs are analysed within the income statement as capital.
All other costs of the investment trust are treated as revenue items.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
The difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method, so as to generate a constant rate of return on the amount outstanding.
Hedge accounting The group has designated US dollar short term borrowings as a hedging instrument to hedge net investment in its US operations.
The hedge was documented at the inception of the relationship and on an ongoing basis the group reviews and documents the effectiveness of the hedge.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument USdollar short term borrowings relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The ordinary shares of the Corporation which have been purchased by the Employee Share Ownership Trust to provide share based payments to employees are valued at cost and deducted from equity.
com The Law Debenture Corporation p. l. c. 58 Notes to the accounts continued 1| Summary of significant accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are either never taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other periods.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is expected to be settled or the asset is expected to be realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
Revenue recognition Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective interest rate applicable.
Sales of services Fees comprise the fair value of the sales of services net of value added tax and after eliminating sales within the group.
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, provided that the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably.
Where the outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably, sales are assessed on the basis of the actual services provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Where payments are received in advance for trusteeships which extend beyond the period end then the amount relating to future periods is deferred using an appropriate discount rate.
Employee benefits Pension costs The group operates a defined benefit pension plan.
The cost of providing benefits under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit method, with independent actuarial calculations being carried out at each year end date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur through other comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the year end date less the fair value of the plan assets.
Profit share schemes The group recognises provisions in respect of its profit share schemes when contractually obliged or when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
com 59 1| Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share based plans The group has awarded share options to executives and the group makes equity based awards to executives.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an appropriate option valuation technique, which is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Reserves A description of each of the reserves follows: Share premium This reserve represents the difference between the issue price of shares and the nominal value of shares at the date of issue, net of related issue costs.
Capital redemption This reserve was created on the cancellation and repayment of the Corporations share capital.
Own shares This represents the cost of shares purchased by the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
Capital reserves The following are dealt with through this reserve: Gains and losses on realisation of investments: and Changes in fair value investments which are readily convertible to cash.
Retained earnings Net revenue profits and losses of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and the fair value costs of share based payments which are revenue in nature are dealt with in this reserve.
Translation reserve This reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and the gains or losses on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of the hedge related to net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Leases Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases, net of incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved.

At 31 December 2014 the goodwill in relation to the operating companies was reviewed.
The review assessed whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows based on management forecasts for 2015, assessed annual growth for 5 years of 5% with no terminal growth, which is based on current expectations and a discount rate of 10%.
On this basis the goodwill is not considered to be impaired.
The group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of goodwill and for the carrying value of goodwill to equal its recoverable amount the future cash flows would need to fall in excess of 20% per annum over the 5 years.

The board maintains strategy guidelines whereby risk is spread over a range of investments, the number of holdings normally being between 70 and 150.
In addition, the stock selections and transactions are actively monitored throughout the year by the investment manager, who reports to the board on a regular basis to review past performance and develop future strategy.
The investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuation: if the valuation at 31 December 2014 fell or rose by 10%, the impact on the groups total profit or loss for the year would have been 60.1 million 2013: 59.5 million.
Corresponding 10% changes in the valuation of the investment portfolio on the Corporations total profit or loss for the year would have been the same.

The short term borrowings were designated as a hedging investment to hedge the net investment in US operations at inception in July 2013.
The hedge has been reviewed on an ongoing basis and it has been effective at all times since inception.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the translation reserve and set off against the gain or loss on the translation of the net investment in US operations.

Liquidity risk Arising from any difficulty in realising assets or raising funds to meet commitments associated with any of the above financial instruments.
To minimise this risk, the boards strategy guidelines only permit investment in equities and fixed interest securities quoted in major financial markets.
In addition, cash balances and overdraft facilities are maintained commensurate with likely future settlements.
The maturity of the groups existing borrowings is set out in note 20. Credit risk Arising from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of their contract.
The group minimises credit risk through policies which restrict deposits to highly rated financial institutions and restrict the maximum exposure to any individual financial institution.
The groups maximum exposure to credit risk arising from financial assets is 57.8 million 2013: 56.5 million.
The Corporations maximum exposure to credit risk arising from financial assets is 8.0 million 2013: 69.5 million.

At 31 December 2014, fair value is the same as book value.
The uncommitted facility has been drawn down in US dollars and interest was payable at 1.5% above HSBCs bank rate.

The 40 million nominal tranche, which produced proceeds of 39.1 million, is constituted by Trust Deed dated 12 October 1999 and the Corporations guarantee is secured by a floating charge on the undertaking and assets of the Corporation.
The bonds are redeemable at nominal amount on 12 October 2034.
Interest see note 5 is payable semi-annually in equal instalments on 12 April and 12 October in each year.
The 6.125% bonds are stated in the statement of financial position at book value.
Restating them at a fair value of 51.5 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 45.3 million has the effect of decreasing the year end NAV by 10.20p 2013: 5.00p.
The estimated fair value is based on the redemption yield of the reference gilt UK Treasury 4.5% 2034 plus a margin derived from the spread of BBB UK corporate bond yields over UK gilt yields.
21 | Contingent liabilities The group is from time to time party to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of the independent fiduciary services business.
The directors do not believe that the outcome of any of the above proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the groups financial position.
The Corporation has provided a guarantee to a subsidiary undertaking in respect of the ongoing liabilities of the group defined benefit pension scheme see note 23.
The Corporation has provided surety for the lease of the groups main property which is held by a subsidiary undertaking.
The annual rental is currently 907,000 and its full term ends in 2020.
com 75 22 | Lease commitments At the year end date, the group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Less than one year 1,314 1,323 Two to five years 3,939 4,380 More than five years 488 1,395 5,741 7,098 Lease payments represent rentals payable by the group for its office properties.
The lease for the main property was negotiated for a term of 16 years and rentals are fixed for an average of five years.
23 | Pension commitments For some employees, the group operates a funded pension plan providing benefits for its employees based on final pensionable emoluments.
The assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Under the defined benefit pension plan, each member's pension at retirement is related to their pensionable service and final pensionable emoluments.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the plan is around 18 years.
The defined benefit scheme is operated from a trust, which has assets which are held separately from the group and trustees who ensure the plan's rules are strictly followed.
These figures were prepared by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19 revised, and are based on membership data as at 31 December 2014.
The funding target is for the plan to hold assets equal in value to the accrued benefits based on projected pensionable emoluments.
If there is a shortfall against this target, then the group and the Trustee will agree deficit contributions to meet this deficit over a period.
There is a risk to the group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the group to make additional contributions to recover any deficit that arises.
Contributions are set based upon funding valuations carried out every three years: the next valuation is due to be carried out as at 31 December 2014.
The estimated amount of total employer contributions expected to be paid to the plan during 2015 is 1.1 million 2014 actual: 1.1 million.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.
The major assumptions in the 31 December 2014 disclosure under IAS19 revised are shown below and are applied to membership data supplied at that date.
