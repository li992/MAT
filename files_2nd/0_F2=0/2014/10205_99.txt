Vesting of long-term incentives for performance to the year ended 30 April 2014 Awards granted in year ended 30 April 2011 On 7 September 2010, Mike Phillips received a recruitment award of 269,801 market value options, equal to approximately 300% of salary.
Vesting of the award was based on annualized EPS growth in excess of RPI for the three financial years ended 30 April 2013.
Annualized EPS growth of the Company in excess of RPI over the Performance Period Vesting percentage of the shares subject to an award Less than 11% p. a.
100% Awards vest on a straight line basis between these points.
The Companys annualized EPS growth over the performance period was 27.57%.
RPI increased by 3.84% per annum over the period resulting in 100% of the award vesting as the growth was in excess of 18.84%.
The exercise price was 316.9 pence, and the share price at vest was 759.5pence.
On 14 April 2011, Kevin Loosemore received an award of 326,000 nil-cost options at zero pence per share, equal to approximately 200% of salary and a further award of 326,000 nil-cost shares at zero pence per share, equal to approximately 200% of salary, provided that he continued to hold at least 163,000 shares over the three year vesting period.
The combined Share Incentive Award over 652,000 shares vested on a straight line basis in line with the return delivered to shareholders over a three year performance period to 14 April 2014.
To ensure alignment with shareholders the percentage of shares vesting is the same percentage as the return to any shareholder who had held shares throughout the period and reinvested Returns of Value.
This was calculated by taking the increase in share price from a start point of 300 pence: adding regular dividends and dividing by 300, to give a multiplier percentage to be used against the 652,000 base figure.
50 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements Additional information and notes and notes The committee determined that the award under the Share Incentive Award was 198.67% or 1,295,328 shares, based upon the average of the closing share price from 7 to 11 April 2014 inclusive of 832 pence.
The closing mid-market price on the date of exercise was 793.75 pence.
The calculation of the amount due has been verified by the Groups remuneration advisers and auditors.
In addition Kevin Loosemores Share Incentive Award entitled him to receive dividends paid in the period on the gross number of shares.
This resulted in a gross payment of 829,269 which was settled through payroll.
This award should be considered in the following context since assuming the position of Executive Chairman, the Company has performed as follows: The share price has increased to 832 pence: There have been Returns of Value of 155 pence per share: and Regular dividends have been 64.02 pence per share.
As we have flagged in the last two Annual Reports, as a consequence of Kevin Loosemores divorce, 25% of any award resulting from his share grant on 14 April 2011 was deliverable to his ex-wife as soon as such award vested.
In order to satisfy this requirement Kevin Loosemore exercised his entire award and the committee decided to satisfy Kevin Loosemores award by granting him stock to the value of the award less applicable taxes and national insurance.
As a result 686,524 shares were issued: 514,893 to Kevin Loosemore which he has retained and 171,631 to his ex-wife.
We believe that this was the most appropriate way to handle the requirement.
On 18 April 2011, Mike Phillips received an award of 146,504 nil-cost options at zero pence per share, equal to approximately 150% of salary.
Vesting of the award was based on annualized EPS growth in excess of RPI over the three years ended 30 April 2014 as set out in the table below.
Annualized EPS growth of the Company in excess of RPI over the performance period Vesting percentage of the shares subject to an award Less than 3% p. a.
Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis Equal to or above 9% p. a.
100% The resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if the ASR is 300 pence or above.
ASR at vesting is to be calculated by the committee as the share price at vesting less the reference price of 291.8 pence plus dividends per share over the vesting period.
The annualized EPS growth over the period exceeded 11.94% being RPI plus 9% and so 100% of the award vested.
In order for the ASR to be less than 300 pence, the share price on the vesting date of 1 July 2014 would need to be 527.77 pence, and therefore the committee believe that the amount of the award that will vest is 150%, or 219,756 options.
These options are valued at the average share price in the last quarter of this financial year being 787 pence and it is unlikely that the share price will fall below 527.77 pence in the next two weeks.
Consequently, the committee has included the value of this increased award at 787 pence in the vested LTIPs for Mike Phillips in the year.
The award will not vest until 1 July 2014 and any change in the value of the award will be reflected in next years remuneration report.
