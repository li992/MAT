Underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the Group.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding the post tax effect of certain non-trading items.
The Directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.

The carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the Groups operating segments before aggregation.
With the exception of Everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units CGUs are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles Brands.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands allocated to the Groups CGUs, as aggregated except in the case of Everlast, is shown below: Goodwill Brands 000 000 UK Sports Retail 9,820 8,500 International Sports Retail 34,691 - Premium Lifestyle 13,692 - Brands excl.
Everlast 40,908 2,192 Everlast 54,438 62,594 153,549 73,286 The Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
The carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each CGU to which the intangible assets are allocated.
A CGU is deemed to be an individual fascia, these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating segments as reported in note 4.
Value in use calculations are based on five year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector served by the CGUs.
SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 61 The key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each CGU, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 27 April 2014 were as follows: International Brands excl.
UK Sports Retail Sports Retail Premium Lifestyle Everlast Everlast Sales growth 5%-6% 5%-6% 3%-4% 6% 1% - 5% Terminal sales growth 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% Gross margin 35% - 45% 35% - 45% 40% - 50% 15% - 50% 25% - 30% Capital expenditure Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Discount rates 11.83% 11.83% 11.83% 11.83% 18.67% The Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital is used in UK Sports Retail, International Sports Retail, Premium Lifestyle and Brands excl.
Everlast as these CGUs are considered to have similar risk profiles.
The key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each CGU.
A reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
All key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.

The reverse combination reserve exists as a result of the adoption of the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in accounting for the group restructuring which occurred on 2 March 2007 and 29 March 2007 between the Company and Sports World International Limited, Brands Holdings Limited, International Brand Management Limited and CDS Holdings SA with Sports World International Limited as the acquirer.
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement only when the hedged transaction impacts the income statement.
Other Balance Sheet Reserves The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates.
The own shares and treasury shares reserve represent the cost of shares in Sports Direct International plc purchased in the market and held by Sports Direct International plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Groups share options scheme, see note 21.

SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 69 Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 27 April 2014, the only financial instruments held at fair value were Derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are classified as Level 2, and Available-for-sale financial assets, which are classified as Level 1. b Derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US dollar.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 27 April 2014 28 April 2013 000 000 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets 4,355 17,965 Fair value of derivative financial instruments liabilities 18,665 - The sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 27 April 2014 28 April 2013 000 000 US dollar purchases 540,349 285,000 Contracted rates 1.61 1.71 1.63 Euro sales - 44,031 Contracted rates - 1.13-1.14 At 27 April 2014 540m of forward US dollar purchase contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the loss on fair valuation of these contracts of 21.6m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
This amount is split between a loss of 3.7m recognised in the period and a loss of 17.9m reclassified in the period.
Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 27 April 2014 245m of purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2013: nil of purchase contracts and nil of sale contracts.
c Sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.
The impact on US dollar related hedging instruments is included in equity.
Positive figures represent an increase decrease in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 27 April 2014 28 April 2013 27 April 2014 28 April 2013 000 000 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 5% US dollar 812 1 5,205 1,783 Euro 2,218 34 2,218 34 Sterling weakens by 5% US dollar 852 702 5,465 1,872 Euro 2,329 35 2,329 35 Interest rate sensitivity analysis The following table illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.

It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
In respect of equity, the Board have decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
The Board is committed to keeping this policy under review and that it would look to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
The objective of the Bonus Share Scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the company.
It is not designed as a means of managing capital.
In respect of cash and borrowings the Board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
The ratio for net debt to reported underlying EBITDA, excluding charges for the bonus share schemes, is 0.64 2013: 0.58.
The objective is to keep this figure below 2.5.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the Group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
These capital management policies have remained unchanged from the prior year.

ACQUISITIONS Details of principal acquisitions for the 52 weeks ended 27 April 2014 are set out below.
29 April 2013 Acquired the remaining 20% of the ordinary share capital of Cruise Clothing Limited.
As this is an acquisition of a non-controlling interest it is outside the scope of IFRS 3.
The difference between the consideration paid 1.0m and the value of non-controlling interests at the date of acquisition 0.6m has been recognised as a debit to retained earnings of 0.4m.
21 June 2013 Acquired the trading assets of Gelert out of administration for cash consideration of 4.7m.
The primary business activity was the wholesale and retail of outdoor sporting equipment and clothing and was acquired to complement existing business activities.
28 June 2013 Acquired 51% of the ordinary share capital of the Sports Eybl and Sports Experts Group EAG, a retailer with 58 stores based in Austria, for consideration of 10.5m.
The primary business activity was the sale of sporting equipment and clothing, and was acquired in order to enter new territories as part of the Groups European expansion plan.
In addition the Group entered into a put and call agreement to acquire the remaining 49%.
This option was exercised on 26 March 2014 for consideration of 12.75m such that the Group now has full control and ownership of EAG which better enables the Group to implement its plans and strategy in this region.
The difference between the consideration paid 11.1m and the value of non-controlling interests at the date of acquisition 8.5m has been recognised as a debit to retained earnings of 19.5m.
12 August 2013 Acquired 60% of the ordinary share capital of SIG, based in the Baltic region, for cash consideration of 7.0m.
The primary business activity was the sale of sporting equipment and clothing and was acquired in order to enter new territories as part of the Groups European expansion plan.
In addition to acquiring 60% of the share capital of SIG, the Group entered into a call option to acquire the remaining 40%.
The risks and rewards of ownership of the remaining 40% remain with the non-controlling interests and therefore the option is accounted for separately.
The call option has been recognised at fair value through profit or loss using the usual method of accounting for derivatives at their net fair value.
At the year end date no value has been attributed to the option.
The fair value of consideration paid, assets and liabilities acquired and resulting goodwill in respect of the above acquisitions is detailed below.
EAG SIG Other Total 000 000 000 000 Cash consideration 9,060 5,989 6,450 21,499 Less: fair value of net liabilities assets acquired 10,805 3,500 5,121 9,184 Goodwill 19,865 9,489 1,329 30,683 The strategic rationale for the acquisitions of EAG and SIG was to enter into new European territories in accordance with the Groups stated strategy.
The premium paid represents the local employee and management expertise and ready-made infrastructure in these markets for which a value cannot be attributed to under IFRS3.
In accounting for these acquisitions the Group has considered whether any fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities, including any separately identifiable intangible assets, need to be recognised.
The following items were considered by the Group: Freehold property the majority of the 80.6m of property, plant and equipment in the EAG balance sheet is freehold property.
The Group referred to a property valuation report that was prepared shortly before the acquisition which provided comfort that the book value was not materially different to market value.
Accordingly no fair value adjustment has been made.
Brands Contracts the principal activities of both EAG and SIG are the retailing of third-party branded products.
There were no internally generated brands or other commercial contracts that formed part of the acquisition.
Fascia names both EAG and SIG trade from established fascia names.
The Group considered the value of these fascia names using the current level of retail sales and an indicative royalty rate discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital.
This exercise indicated that there was no material value to be attributed to the fascia names.
Websites the websites acquired were not generating profits and therefore no value has been attributed to them.
Operating leases there are a number of operating leases within both EAG and SIG.
The Group consider the rentals payable under these leases to be approximate to market value.
Accordingly no fair value adjustment has been made for intangible assets relating to operating leases.
The Group did identify that no provision had been made locally in respect of loss making stores and therefore a fair value adjustment has been recognised to align this with the Groups policy.
Costs of 1.2m relating to the above acquisitions were expensed through the income statement during the year and were expensed as administration expenses.
None of the acquisitions included in other above are considered to be individually material.
