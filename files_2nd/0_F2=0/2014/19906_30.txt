FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SECTION 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION This section lays out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The Unite Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the first time application of the following standards: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 2011, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011 and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement The adoption of these standards has not had a significant effect on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections 18 months forward to June 2016 and the Group has sufficient headroom to meet all its commitments.
The Group has one undrawn facility maturing in 2015 which will be replaced by a new facility with one of the Groups relationship banks.
Indicative terms have been received and are currently being agreed.
This facility will be a sufficient size to incorporate another facility which matures at the end of 2016.
The Group has historically maintained positive relationships with its lending banks and has always secured new facilities before maturity dates and within its covenant levels.
The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2014.
Our debt facilities include loan to value, interest cover and minimum net worth covenants, all of which have a high level of headroom.
In order to manage future financial commitments, the Group operates a formal approval process, through its Major Investment Approvals Committee, to ensure appropriate review is undertaken before any transactions are agreed.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has an existing right that gives it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary, has exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets.

The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to have an impact upon the Group are: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was reissued in October 2010 as the second step in the International Accounting Standards Board IASB project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
During the year the IASB reissued IFRS 9 to include hedge accounting and details on early adoption.
The final revision to the standard incorporating the impairment, classification and measurement requirements was issued by the IASB in July 2014.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the revisions on the Groups results and financial position IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued on 28 May 2014.
This standard sets out revenue recognition conditions for the Group.
The impact of this standard on the Group is being assessed The adoption of the following standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements of the Group: Amendments to IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements reinstate the equity method as an accounting option for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in an entitys separate financial statements Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The Annual Improvements 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 Cycles includes amendments to a number of different accounting standards The Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle includes amendments to a number of different accounting standards Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Valuation of investment property, investment property under development, completed properties and properties under development note 3.1 Taxation note 2.5 The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which are as follows: Classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 97 97 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED SECTION 2: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.
EPRA earnings and NAV movement are the Groups main key performance indicators.
This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.

The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Board therefore does not consider that the Group has meaningful geographical segments.
2.2 Earnings The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is set out in the Operations review on pages 30 32.
The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to manage the Operations business.
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment.

As these properties contribute to the Groups rental income, the Group consider these lease costs to be a form of financing.
Included in the above is rental income of 20.3 million and property operating expenses of 6.2 million relating to sale and leaseback properties.
The 1.9 million charge that is unallocated to segments includes the fair value of share based payments of 2.1 million, Unite Foundation of 0.9 million, share of monies received from Landsbanki of 0.4 million, fees received from USAF relating to acquisitions of 1.2 million, deferred tax of 0.5 million and current tax charges of 1.0 million.

The EPRA earnings reconcile to the profit reported under IFRS as follows: 2014 2013 Note m m EPRA earnings 2.2a 33.3 30.6 Net valuation gains on investment property 3.1 43.3 35.4 Property disposals and write downs 3.3 1.9 Share of joint venture gains on investment property 3.4b 35.7 13.5 Share of joint venture property disposals and write downs 0.6 0.1 Mark to market changes in interest rate swaps 4.3 1.3 0.7 Interest rate swap payments on ineffective hedges 1.2 4.4 Debt exit costs 1.6 0.4 Share of joint venture interest rate swaps charges 3.4b 3.8 Share of joint venture debt exit costs 3.4b 0.1 2.2 Deferred tax relating to interest rate swap movement 0.2 2.1 Deferred tax relating to properties 2.7 Minority interest share of reconciling items 1.1 0.3 Profit attributable to owners of the parent company 102.6 78.0 Within IFRS reported profit, there is a 1.3 million loss 2013: 0.7 million profit relating to movements in the mark to market of ineffective interest rate swaps: this full loss can be seen in note 4.3.
Part of this movement, 1.2 million 2013: 4.4 million, relates to actual interest payments made on these swaps and is considered to be a true operating cost of the Operations segment.
It is therefore already included within Net Financing Costs in the Operating segment result in note 2.2a.
The minority interest share, or non-controlling interest, arises as a result of the Company not owning 100% of the share capital of one of its subsidiaries, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd. More detail is provided in note 3.4.

Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to more accurately show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
EPRA EPS and EPRA EPS pre UCC promote fee are calculated using EPRA earnings.
The calculations of basic and adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 December 2014 is as follows: 2014 2013 Note m m Earnings Basic and diluted 102.6 78.0 EPRA 2.2a 33.3 30.6 EPRA pre UCC promote fee 2.2a 33.3 23.1 Weighted average number of shares thousands Basic 193,319 169,561 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 2,966 255 Diluted 196,285 169,816 Earnings per share pence Basic 53.1p 46.0p Diluted 52.3p 46.0p EPRA EPS 17.2p 18.0p EPRA EPS pre UCC promote fee 17.2p 13.6p Movements in the weighted average number of shares have resulted from the placing in April 2014 and the issue of shares arising from the employee share based payment schemes.
The placing comprised 24,500,000 shares and gave rise to proceeds of 100.5 million, 96.0 million net of issue costs.
Excluded from the potential dilutive shares share options, in 2014, are 1,174,000 2013: 3,697,000 options which do not affect the diluted weighted average number of shares.

These are the main differences between EPRA NAV and Net Assets reported under IFRS.
The Group also manages NAV using EPRA NNNAV, which adjusts EPRA NAV to include the fair value of swaps and debt.
This is considered to give stakeholders the most relevant information on the current fair value of all the assets and liabilities in the Group.

The cost of sales included in the consolidated income statement includes property operating expenses of 25.9 million 2013: 25.1 million, operating lease rentals of 14.4 million 2013: 13.7 million, costs associated with development fees of 2.7 million 2013: 2.1 million and the carrying value of property sales of 7.0 million 2013: 0.9 million.
Accounting policies Revenue is recognised on the following bases: Rental income Rental income from property leased out under operating leases comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are sometimes granted on commercial units: these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Property sales Income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged.
Management and promote fees The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
In addition, the Group is entitled to promote fees from USAF and UCC LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the joint ventures as consideration for the promote fee.
Management and promote fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services are provided.

However it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries predominantly the investments in USAF.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Forecasting future taxable profits to which these losses will be offset requires significant judgements and assumptions regarding future performance.
The recoverability of the assets recognised could vary significantly if different assumptions are applied in estimating future taxable profits.
In addition, the potential conversion to a REIT in the medium term may make some of the tax losses inaccessible at some point in the future, but the timing of such conversion has not been determined.
Deferred tax assets in respect of forecast taxable profits have been restricted to the next two years.
a Tax income statement The total taxation charge credit in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2014 2013 m m Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 1.2 0.5 Current tax charge 1.2 0.5 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 2.4 1.8 Effect of change in tax rate 0.3 Recognition of previously unrecognised asset 0.6 Deferred tax charge credit 2.4 2.7 Total tax charge credit in income statement 3.6 2.2 108 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 108 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other SECTION 2: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR CONTINUED 2.5 Tax continued a Tax income statement continued In the income statement, a tax charge of 3.6 million arises on a profit before tax of 108.4 million, the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2014 2013 m m Profit before tax 108.4 77.1 Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.3% 23.3 17.9 Effect of indexation on investment and development property 1.9 3.0 Non-deductible items 11.5 6.9 Movement on unprovided deferred tax asset 4.3 8.0 Profits chargeable at lower rate 0.1 0.1 Effect of property disposals 1.1 0.2 Rate difference on deferred tax 0.1 1.3 Recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax asset 0.6 Prior years adjustments 0.7 Total tax charge credit in income statement 3.6 2.2 Included within non-deductible items of 11.5m are adjustments for property revaluations that are not subject to tax.
Other non-deductible items include tax only adjustments, and expenditure not ordinarily allowable for tax purposes such as aborted deal costs.

Complexities in the Group structure mean these losses may be inaccessible and the Group is considering converting to REIT status in the medium term.
Accordingly, the recognised deferred tax asset has been restricted to those losses which are likely be utilised in the next two years.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% effective 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2014 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary timing differences of 69.3 million 2013: 51.6 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives EPRA net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in four groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
iii Completed properties current assets These are assets acquired by the Group with the intention to hold the assets for a short period prior to disposal to a joint venture or third parties.
The Group continues to earn rental income and capital appreciation on these assets which are held at cost in the balance sheet.
iv Properties under development current assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Completed properties on completion.

Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 5.6% 2013: 6.3%.
The valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions, market conditions, rental income, occupancy and property management costs could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets.
Valuation process The valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ending 31 December 2014 and 2013.
The reports are based on both: Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc.
This information is derived from the Groups financial systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yield and discount rates.
These are based on their professional judgement and market observation.
The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Property board and the CFO.
This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year.

Recurring fair value measurement All investment and development properties are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Whilst completed property and property under development are held at cost in the balance sheet, the Group discloses the fair value of these assets and includes them at fair value in EPRA NAV.
Completed property and property under development fair value measurements are categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and their fair value is measured using the same techniques as for investment properties and investment properties under development.

Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the markets general perception of the lessees credit worthiness.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions.
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the discounted cash flow method less estimated costs to completion.

Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties.
Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Groups head office and London office as well as computer hardware and software at these sites.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter life of lease and economic life Other assets 4-20 years Intangible assets Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and processes transactions within the sales cycle.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred.
The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over four to five years being the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement.

The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
USAF and UCC LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements and Unites role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following recent changes to accounting standards IFRS 10 involves judgements around a number of significant factors.
These factors include how Unite as fund manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding whether through debt or equity.
This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unitholders and how their rights are represented through an Advisory Committee.
For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control.
However, for the activities which are considered to have significant impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Advisory Committee and the Group have joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture.
The assessment for UCC LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.
During the year the Group has operated four joint ventures: following the disposal of OCB and the merger of LSAV and UCC the Group now operates two joint ventures.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
During the year the remaining joint venture investment loans to OCB were repaid in full.
This also resulted in the accelerated unwinding of the discount on the joint venture interest free loans of 0.4 million in the income statement note 4.3.
This is offset in the income statement by a corresponding accelerated unwinding of discount through the share of joint venture profit of 0.4 million note 3.4a.
The remaining interest free loans provided to joint ventures have no fixed repayment dates.
These are accordingly treated as part of the cost of the investment in the joint ventures.
c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property fund manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
The Group has recognised the following management fees in its results for the year.

On a see-through basis these costs are deducted from the property management fees shown above, plus an adjustment for the minority interest of 0.2 million 2013: 0.2 million.
This results in the net fees included in the Operating segment result note 2.2a of 10.0 million 2013: 10.6 million.
Development management fees are included in the Property segment result note 2.2a.
Promote fees and acquisition fees are included within the unallocated to segments note 2.2a.
Included in the movement in EPRA NAV in the year is a USAF property acquisition fee of 1.2 million.
This is the gross fee of 1.4 million paid by USAF net of a 0.2 million adjustment related to trading with joint ventures.

The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond.
The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.5% until 10 October 2018.
In accordance with IFRS, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
As a result, 80.3 million was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6 million, which represents the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value is amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 2.0 million were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component is being amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2 million are not amortised.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 12.5 29.7 4.9 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 40.5 93.2 In more than two years but not more than five years 106.7 182.3 81.2 79.0 In more than five years 330.1 208.2 90.0 90.0 477.3 483.7 171.2 169.0 Total borrowings 489.8 513.4 171.2 173.9 In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 76.5 million 2013: 58.2 million.
A further overdraft facility of 10.0 million 2013: 10.0 million is also available.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans carried at 332.5 million 2013: 211.0 million and the convertible bond carried at 82.5 million 2013: 80.7.
The convertible bond and 90.0 million 2013: 90.0 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 1 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have a fair value of 194.5 million 2013: 188.5 million.
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
The remaining 242.5 million 2013: 119.5 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of these loans is 224.0 million 2013: 116.7 million.
Properties with a carrying value of 651.9 million 2013: 657.2 million have been pledged as security against the Groups drawn down borrowings.
The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 123 123 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED SECTION 4: FUNDING CONTINUED 4.2 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2014 2013 m m Current 0.4 2.0 Non-current 1.9 3.4 Fair value of interest rate swaps 2.3 5.4 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
4.3 Net financing costs Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.

The overall average cost of investment debt on a see-through basis is 4.7% 2013: 4.7%.
4.4 Gearing The Groups adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtedness.
EPRA net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.
The Groups gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 2014 2013 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 5.1 41.4 43.2 Current borrowings 4.1 12.5 29.7 Non-current borrowings 4.1 477.3 483.7 Interest rate swaps liabilities 4.2 2.3 5.4 Net debt per balance sheet 450.7 475.6 Mark to market of interest rate swaps 2.3 5.4 Adjusted net debt 448.4 470.2 Reported net asset value attributable to owners of the parent company 2.3c 842.5 653.3 EPRA net asset value 2.3c 881.1 681.6 Gearing Basic Net debt Reported net asset value 53% 73% Adjusted gearing Adjusted net debt EPRA net asset value 51% 69% See-through adjusted gearing including share of JV properties and net debt 79% 98% See-through adjusted LTV 43% 49% The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 125 125 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED SECTION 4: FUNDING CONTINUED 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing The Group had no development borrowings as at 31 December 2014 2013: 17.5 million.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer-term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups policy allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of this floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2014, the Groups policy guideline has been to hedge 75% and 95% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2 10 years.
At 31 December 2014, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 100% 2013: 84% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
Excluding the 79.6 million 2013: 133.0 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 4.6% 2013: 4.7% for an average period of 7 years 2013: 7 years : including these swaps the average rate is 4.4% 2013: 4.1%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2014 against 79.6 million 2013: 133.0 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2014 2013 2013 Nominal 2014 Nominal Applicable amount Applicable amount interest hedged interest rates hedged rates m % m % Within one year 23.0 3.0 34.0 3.1 5.8 Between one and two years 51.1 2.6 55.0 2.3 Between two and five years 38.0 2.6 More than five years 5.5 5.6 6.0 5.6 During the year, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million 2013: 0.7 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table on the next page analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

The bonds have a maturity date of 10 October 2018.
The bondholders may exercise the Conversion Right in certain circumstances but this is contingent on a number of factors and therefore the bonds are shown to maturity in the above disclosure.
c Covenant compliance Many of the Groups funding facilities carry covenants.
The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2014, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants.
The Group is able to use available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value LTV covenants.
The covenant headroom position is outlined below and assumes that the Group is able to use a mixture of available cash and add additional property to banks security pools.

Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the property interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.
The Group has a number of sale and leaseback properties which are accounted for as operating leases.
The total future minimum lease rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for repayment as follows: 2014 2013 m m Less than one year 14.8 14.7 Between one and five years 57.5 56.5 More than five years 171.4 183.2 Total 243.7 254.4 These leases primarily relate to properties which the Group has sold and leased back and on which rental income is earned.
The leases are generally for periods between 14 and 19 years and subject to annual RPI-based rent review.
Two properties are subject to a fixed annual rent increase of 2%.
The total operating lease expenditure incurred during the year was 14.8 million 2013: 15.0 million.
b Receivable The Group accounts for its tenancy contracts offered to commercial and individual tenants as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2014 2012 m m Less than one year 73.7 63.4 Between one and five years 48.3 47.6 More than five years 65.4 48.0 Total 187.4 159.0 128 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 128 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other SECTION 4: FUNDING CONTINUED 4.7 Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and adjusted net debt, including cash held on deposit.
The Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The components and calculation of adjusted net debt is set out in note 4.4.
Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: Adjusted net debt 4.4 Adjusted gearing 4.4 See-through LTV 2.3a Weighted average cost of investment debt 4.5aii In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to recycle capital invested in lower performing assets into new assets and property developments.
71 million of property assets were sold in 2014 and we plan to sell an average of 50 million 100 million of property each year.
The Group targets a yield on cost of approximately 9%.
The Group does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full cost of the development is secure.
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits.
The Operations segment generated cash of 35.0 million 2013: 23.2 million during the year, thereby covering the proposed dividend of 22.5 million, 1.6 times 2013: 8.5 million, 2.7 times.
4.8 Equity Accounting policies Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination, are shown as a deduction, net of tax, in equity from the proceeds.
Share issue costs incurred directly in connection with a business combination are deducted from the proceeds of the issue.
The Companys issued share capital has increased during the year as follows: Number of ordinary shares 2014 2013 Issued at start of year fully paid 176,657,924 160,461,442 Share placing 24,500,000 16,000,000 Share options exercised 383,879 196,482 Issued at end of year fully paid 201,541,803 176,657,924 The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
On 12 April 2014 the Group completed a share placing and open offer of 24,500,000 shares, which gave rise to proceeds of 100.5 million, 96.2 million net of issue costs.

After the year end, the Directors proposed a final dividend per share of 9.0p 2013: 3.2p, bringing the total dividend per share for the year to 11.2p 2013: 4.8p.
No provision has been made in relation to this dividend.
SECTION 5: WORKING CAPITAL This section focuses on how the Group generates its operating cash flows.
Careful management of working capital is vital to ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Groups cash position and how cash is generated from the Groups trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables.
5.1 Cash Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
The Groups cash position at 31 December 2014 was 41.4 million 2013: 43.2 million.
At 31 December 2014 the Company had a cash balance of 8.6 million 2013: overdraft of 4.9 million.
The Groups cash balances include 12.8 million 2013: 13.4 million whose use at the balance sheet date is restricted by funding agreements to pay operating costs and loan interest relating to specific properties.

Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Board, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows, all trade and other receivables are current: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Trade receivables 1.9 2.2 Amounts due from Group undertakings 494.4 393.5 Amounts owed by joint ventures 28.1 29.3 Prepayments and accrued income 11.5 15.3 Other receivables 1.9 3.2 Trade and other receivables 43.4 50.0 494.4 393.5 The Group offers tenancy contracts to commercial Universities and retail unit tenants and individual tenants based on the academic year.

It arises principally from the Groups cash balances, the Groups receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans provided to the Groups joint ventures.
At the year end, the Groups exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2014 2013 Note m m Cash 5.1 41.4 43.2 Trade receivables 5.2 1.9 2.2 Amounts due by joint ventures excluding loans that are capital in nature 5.2 28.1 29.3 Joint venture investment loans 3.4b 10.2 71.4 84.9 a Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates.
b Trade receivables The Groups customers can be split into three groups i students individuals, ii commercial organisations including Universities and iii manufacturing customers.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer.
The Group holds tenant deposits of 8.3 million 2013: 8.1 million as collateral against individual customers.
c Joint ventures Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories working capital balances and investment loans.
