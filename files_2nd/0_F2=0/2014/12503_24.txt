The US Plan is a cash balance plan, with the exception of UK participants who accrue 2013 14 2012 13 m m benefits on a final salary basis.

The mortality tables have been based on a postcode mortality study, carried out as part of the 5 April 2011 funding valuation.
These tables will be reviewed as part of the 5 April 2014 funding valuation.

The UK Plans investment strategy is to invest broadly 50% in return-seeking assets via diversified growth funds and 50% in matching assets index-linked gilts and corporate bonds.
This strategy reflects the UK Plans liability profile and the Trustees and Groups attitude to risk.
As the Fund matures, the Trustees and the Group expect to gradually reduce the proportion allocated to return-seeking assets and increase the proportion allocated to matching assets.

With regard to the US costs these are paid by the US Plan.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation for the UK is 16 years and for the US Plan, 12 years.
Assets and obligations associated with the schemes may be sensitive to changes in market values of assets and market related assumptions used in the valuation of scheme liabilities.
Changes to asset values, discount rates, or inflation could change the future pension costs and funding requirements.

The change in discount rate is assumed to be due to a 1% per annum decrease in corporate bond yields.
The sensitivities to inflation assumption changes include corresponding changes to the future salary and pension increase assumptions.
