23 Share-Based Payments The Group operates a number of incentive schemes, including a share option scheme, a restricted share scheme, and other share award schemes.

executive Share Awards Executive share awards, comprising both Executive Share Options and Restricted Share Awards, are awarded to the Top400 Management Group.
Executive Share Options are awarded at an exercise price determined on grant date and become payable on exercise following satisfaction of performance criteria.
Restricted Share Awards entitle the recipient to receive shares at no cost following satisfaction of the following performance criteria.
For awards granted between December 2007 and December 2012: Adjusted earnings per share growth over three years % 6% 6% 7% 8% 9% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 40% 60% 80% 100% For awards granted in December 2013 and December 2014: Adjusted earnings per share growth over three years % 6% 6% Between 6% and 10% 10% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100% The cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
For Executive Committee and Top40 members vesting conditions must be met over the three-year period and are not retested.
For remaining Top400 members the targets can be retested over four or five years.
If any target has not been met any remaining shares or options which have not vested will lapse.
other Share Awards Other share awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Other share awards have contractual lives of three to seven years and are generally not subject to any vesting criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Individual tranches of these other share awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the tables below.
modifications to Share Awards Following the demerger of RB Pharmaceuticals, the Remuneration Committee approved modifications to all unexercised share schemes to compensate for the loss of scheme value.
For SAYE schemes this was in the form of a one-off cash payment.
For executive share awards this included additional grants and the lowering of exercise price, where applicable.
There is no change to the IFRS fair value charge as a result of these modifications.
RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 110 Financial Statements 23 Share-Based Payments continued All outstanding Executive and Other share awards as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2014 and 2013.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2014 that could have been exercised at that date were 3,449,012 2013: 4,360,531 with a weighted average exercise price of 29.06 2013: 28.35.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the schemes, early exercise may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to these calculations in 2014 or 2013 for the purposes of the valuation.
An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payment transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 50.51 2013: 45.80.
