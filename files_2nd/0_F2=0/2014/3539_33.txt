120 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 27.
Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation tothe Companys financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executive Officers Review on pages 18 to 25 and the Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 26 and 29.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Executive Officers Review on pages 18 to 25.
In addition Note 22 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidityrisk.
Going Concern As highlighted in Note 22 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank facilities which provides funding of 400m of which 275m is term loan and 125m is a revolving credit facility.
160m 192m of the facility is available in Euros, reflecting the composition of the combined Group.
This financing arrangement becameeffective from 27 February 2014.
The bank loan is unsecured and subject to two covenants: the ratio of EBITDA to net debt and the ratio of EBITDAR pre-rent EBITDA to net finance charges.
As at the period end, 165m and 132m of the term loan plus 44m of the revolving facility were drawn down.
While the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over a the level of demand for the Groups products: and b the availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future, the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility, including compliance with the bank facility covenants.
The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and lossaccount.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that its cash flows are included within the consolidated financial statements of Cineworld Group plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Cineworld Group where the Group controls 100% of the voting rights.
Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Impairment The Group evaluates its investments for financial impairment where events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofsuch assets may not be fully recoverable.
When such evaluations indicate that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable value, an impairment in value is recorded.
Deferred Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required byFRS 19.
Classification of Financial Instruments Issued by the Company Following the adoption of FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includesno obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equityinstruments.
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 121 27.
Accounting Policies continued To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Share-Based Payment Transactions The share options programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an addition to fixed asset investments with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of theoptions granted is measured using an evaluation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Shares appreciation rights are also granted by the Company to employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spreadover the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which theinstruments were granted.
The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss spread equally over the vesting period.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost ofinvestment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Amounts recharged to or reimbursed by the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group sponsored EBT are included in the Group financial information.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Staff Numbers and Costs The Company pays no employees.
Salaries of the Directors of the Company, including Non-Executive Directors, as well as theCompany Secretary are recharged to the Company from its subsidiary Cineworld Cinemas Ltd. Total salaries paid to Non-Executive Directors were 478,000 2013: 314,000.
