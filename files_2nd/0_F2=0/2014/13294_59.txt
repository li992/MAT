Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 113 3FOJTIBX QMD Annual report and accounts 2014 'JOBODJBM JOTUSVNFOUT The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
$SFEJU SJTL The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of the Groups financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash 2013 2013 2013 $VSSFODZ b 000 b 000 b 000 Pound Sterling 7,639 7,566 11,187 US Dollar 22,408 305 4,174 Japanese Yen 6,403 11,510 1,319 Euro 18,277 1,428 3,141 Other 13,355 1,621 6,784 68,082 22,430 26,605 The above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with the exception of 3,622,000 of Euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the Company, along with some foreign currency cash balances which are of a short-term nature.
Also, see note below on net assets and associated borrowings, regarding the holding of foreign currency borrowings by the Company in respect of its hedging activity.
The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 2013 b 000 Past due 01 month 9,412 Past due 12 months 3,860 Past due more than 2 months 2,931 Balance at the end of the year 16,203 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2013 b 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 3,829 Changes in amounts provided 85 Amounts utilised 389 Balance at the end of the year 3,525 -JRVJEJUZ SJTL The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash ow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are oating and based on LIBOR LIBID, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 400,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined byreference to market data.

There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
The fair values of the forward exchange contracts have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash ows on the basis of market expectations of future exchange rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
There are no other material financial assets or liabilities that meet the criteria for disclosure under IFRS 13.
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.. BSLFU SJTL As noted in the Strategic report under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority ofsales being made in these currencies but with most manufacturing being undertaken in the UK, Ireland and India.
&YDIBOHF SBUFT BOE TFOTJUJWJUZ BOBMZTJT The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro cash ows and hence the impact on the Groups results resulting from uctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling is lessened.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change, a one Japanese Yen change and a one Euro cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.
