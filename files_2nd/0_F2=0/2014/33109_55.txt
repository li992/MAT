A percentage of any payment made under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares and held in trust for three years.

The scheme is detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 93.

22 ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers.
Vesting of awards is subject to three or fouryear performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 93.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be entitled to the award, in which case the award will be pro-rated on length of employment in relation to the award date.
In 2012, the LTIP performance period was extended from three to four years.
To avoid the position where there would be no potential vesting in 2015, transitionary arrangements were put in place: a Transitionary LTIP award based on three-year performance conditions was made in addition to the 2012 LTIP award which was based on a four-year performance period.
For both awards, the grant size was reduced by 25 per cent.
The same performance targets apply to both awards.
Subsequent awards will vest on four-year performance.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 339.5p, the closing mid-market share price on 8 April 2014.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.

UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year performance and their salary.
In 2014, participating employees were awarded shares of 7 per cent of their salary or 3,000, whichever was lower.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from date ofaward the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is entitled to the shares due to certain leaver circumstances, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
22 iv Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group by the end of the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is entitled to the award due to the terms of leaving.
Shares in respect of the GSIP are held in the SEGRO plc Employees Benefit Trust.
