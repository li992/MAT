101 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2014 25 Pension Scheme The Group sponsors two pension arrangements.
The following disclosures apply to both the Group and the Company.
The Alliance Trust Companies Pension Fund the Scheme is a funded defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to future accrual on 2 April 2011.
Employees, other than Executive Directors, received contributions into their own Self Invested Personal Pension provided by ATS totaling 1.7m 1.6m.
The disclosures which follow relate to the Scheme.
Participating Employer ATSL is the sole Participating Employer and its pension obligations are guaranteed by the Company.
Valuation and Contributions The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 April 2012 although for the purpose of these calculations the results of the 1 April 2012 valuation have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2014.
Valuations are on the projected unit credit method.
The contribution made by the Company over the financial year was 1.5m 1.5m.
Risks The Scheme typically exposes the Group to risks such as: - Investment risk: The Scheme holds some of its investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and, while these assets are expected to provide the best returns over the long term, any short-term volatility could cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
- Interest rate risk: The Scheme's liabilities are assessed using market rates of interest to discount the liabilities and are therefore subject to any volatility in the movement of the market rate of interest.
The net interest income or expense recognised in profit or loss is also calculated using the market rate of interest.
- Inflation risk: A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Fund's assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short term could lead to a deficit emerging.
- Mortality risk: In the event that members live longer than assumed the liabilities may turn out to have been understated originally, and a deficit may emerge if funding has not been adequately provided for the increased life expectancy.

We have assumed that the long term CPI assumption is 0.9% lower than the corresponding RPI assumption.
The mortality assumptions, adopted at 31 December 2014, follow the S1PA table, using 90% of the base table with CMI 2013 mortality projections with improvement subject to 1% minimum to the annual improvements.
The assumptions imply the following life expectancy from age 65.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 24 years.
