37.0m 2013: 37.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values, including the brand value of Charles Church which is classified as goodwill as this was acquired before the date of transition to IFRSs, are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes down to a lower level than the Groups single operating segment, being to Charles Church and to the portfolios of strategic land holdings throughout the UK acquired with Beazer and Westbury.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for four years, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review of the brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between 3% to 2% 2013: 3% to 2%, reflecting the current state of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between 3% to 2% 2013: 3% to 2%.
After this period the growth rates applied to calculate the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 2% 2013: nil and 2% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 5% and 11% 2013: 5% and 10% over the forecast periods.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 84 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 14 Intangible assets continued The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 8.0m 2013: 6.6m.
This charge reflects ongoing consumption of the acquired strategic land holdings.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot for which management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission is sold.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 102.0m 2013: 108.2m and 30.9m 2013: 32.7m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m 2013: 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
In addition, there is 60.0m 2013: 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
No reasonable possible change in any of the assumptions noted above would lead to an impairment charge being required.
However, in the event of deterioration in the UK housing market conditions, operating margins reducing, or appropriate discount rates increasing the possibility of impairment losses in the future remains.
