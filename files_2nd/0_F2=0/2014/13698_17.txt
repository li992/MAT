Accounts Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain assets and are in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied: Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised.
Purchased goodwill is written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of up to 20 years.
Valuation of investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets, excluding freehold land, over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Alterations to leasehold premises Life of lease Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures, fittings, IT and equipment 3 to 8 years Revaluation of properties The Company has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements in FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets and retained the book values of certain freehold properties that were revalued prior to implementation of that standard.
Where an asset that was previously revalued is disposed of, its book value is eliminated and an appropriate transfer made from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Leased assets and assets held under hire purchase contracts Where assets are financed by hire purchase or leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership finance leases, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term.
The corresponding leasing commitments are shown as amounts payable to the lessor.
Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest using the actuarial method and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Their annual rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Pension costs Contributions to the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they become payable.
Share based employee remuneration The Company has applied FRS 20 Share-based payment to all share options and conditional share awards which were granted to employees and had not vested at 1 January 2005.
A charge is recognised on the same basis as that recognised for the Group under IFRS 2.
Where the Company will be issuing shares to satisfy share awards made by its subsidiaries, the Company makes a change to its subsidiaries equal to the fair value of the share-based payment incurred.
Accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP In accordance with UITF 32, the assets, income and expenditure of the ESOP Trust are incorporated into the Company Financial Statements.
Financial instruments Disclosures on financial instruments have not been included in the Companys financial statements as its consolidated financial statements include appropriate disclosures.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Trade debtors and other receivables are financial assets that are recognised at fair value on inception and are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
They are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses are taken to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Amounts held at amortised cost Trade creditors and other payables including bank loans are financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value on inception and are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council FRC.
Accordingly, in the year ending 31 December 2015 the Company intends to transition to reporting under FRS 102 as issued by the FRC.
The Company intends to take advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard.
Any shareholder who objects to this proposal should write to the company secretary at the Registered Office.

com 81 Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to Remuneration Committee Annual Report 1.
Approach to Remuneration The overall policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set total on target reward at up to median level compared with the Companys comparator groups.
For the purpose of benchmarking salaries and other remuneration the principal grouping used by the Company consists of companies within the FTSE 250 with a range of capitalisations such that the company sits within the middle of that grouping.
The Committee wishes to ensure that the fixed element of remuneration is not excessive and that total actual payments to executives will only exceed the median level within the Companys comparator groups through the operation of the performance related element of the package.
As described in the Annual Statement of the Chairman the performance elements of total reward are directly linked to the achievement of the Companys strategy.
Remuneration Policy and Implementation The following table sets out the key elements of policy and any changes in its implementation for 2015: Changes in Implementation Element Operation of Element Potential Value Performance Metrics for 2015 Salary An Executive Directors basic The Committees overall policy There are no performance Salaries were increased by salary is considered by the is to set total on target reward conditions attached to the 2% as at 1 January 2015 and Committee on appointment and at up to median level compared payment of salary although are now normally reviewed once a year or with the Companys comparator there are a number of A.
