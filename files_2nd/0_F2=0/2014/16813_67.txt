2015 annual bonus GSTIP The performance measures and weightings for 2015 are as follows: a Service revenue 25% : a EBITDA 25% : a adjusted free cash flow 25% : and a competitive performance assessment 25%.
This is an assessment encompassing both net promoter score NPS and market share against the competitors in each of our markets.

Long-term incentive GLTI awards for 2015 As described in our policy on pages 72 to 74 the performance conditions are a combination of adjusted free cash flow and TSR performance.
The details for the 2015 award will be as follows with linear interpolation between points : TSR out performance TSR peer group 0% 5% 10% Bharti Orange 1 Adjusted free cash flow measure bn Up to median 65th percentile equivalent 80th percentile equivalent BT Group Telecom Italia Below threshold 3.4 0% 0% 0% Deutsche Telekom Telefnica Threshold 3.4 50% 75% 100% MTN Target 5.1 100% 150% 200% Maximum 6.8 125% 187.5% 250% Note: 1 When considered on a like-for-like basis with targets for previous years e. g. excluding the impact of Project Spring the adjusted cash flow target is 12.3 billion.
The combined vesting percentages are applied to the target number of shares granted.
We have made the following changes to the long-term incentive since the last award: a the maximum vesting level has reduced from three times to two and a half times the target vesting level: a a mandatory holding period has been introduced where 50% of the post-tax shares are released after vesting, a further 25% after the first anniversary of vesting, and the remaining 25% will bereleased after the second anniversary: and a AT&T has been removed from the peer group, Bharti and MTN have been added as stand alone comparators and the remaining emerging market proxy company Turkcell has also been removed.
Long-term incentive GLTI awards vesting As discussed elsewhere in the annual report, Project Spring involves significant organic investment over the next two years to enhance network and serviceleadership further.
This investment will have a significant impact on adjusted Free Cash Flow FCF, which is the primary performance condition for the GLTI and we expect an initial drop in FCF that will then build again as the investment pays off over the longer term.
The impact is predicted as follows: Financial year of award Performance period end Impact 2013 March 2015 Targets for the 2013 and 2014 awards were set prior to the announcement of Project Spring therefore we will remove the impact on FCF when calculating the vesting 2014 March 2016 results following the end of each performance period.
2015 onwards March 2017 onwards The 2015 awards and all future years will have the full impact of Project Spring included in the targets and no further adjustments will be necessary.
