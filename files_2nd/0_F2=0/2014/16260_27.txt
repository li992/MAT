Financial Statements Section 6: Acquisitions and disposals 6.1 Acquisitions Growth through acquisitions is one of the Groups priorities in order to deliver its strategy of expansion through the acquisition of Events and Events portfolios in growth markets.
Further details of the Groups strategy are provided in the Strategic Review on pages 10 to 23.
The Group completed four acquisitions during 2014 of which Advanstar Communications Advanstar was particularly significant 2013: five acquisitions none of which were individually significant.
All values in relation to Advanstar are provisional as at 31 December 2014.
Accounting policy The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred is measured at the amount of cash and cash equivalents transferred, the fair value of any equity instruments transferred and the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of IAS 39 are recognised in profit or loss.
The Group recognises the fair values of the assets acquired, the liabilities including contingent liabilities assumed, and the equity interests issued by the Group.
For significant acquisitions, management is assisted by external advisors in identifying and measuring the fair values of any intangible assets acquired.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value under the full goodwill method or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
When the full goodwill method is used, the fair value of the non-controlling interest is measured using a multiples approach adjusted for the discount that market participants would expect for the lack of control.
Acquisition costs incurred are recognised as an expense in profit or loss and classified as exceptional items.
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying amount of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
When there is a change in ownership of a subsidiary without a change in control, the difference between the consideration paid received and the relevant share of the carrying amount of net assets acquired disposed of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.

6.4 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Accounting policy Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if: their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale, rather than continuing use: they are available for immediate sale: and the sale is highly probable.
A disposal group consists of assets that are to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities.
Goodwill arising from business combinations is included for cash generating units which are part of the disposal group.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis.
Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
