STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General Information Alent plc the Company is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group can be found within the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 41.
The Companys registered address is Forsyth Road, Sheerwater, Woking GU21 5RZ.
Basis of preparation 2.1 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of Alent plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS.
2.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Amended presentation of share of post-tax profit of joint ventures The Company has amended the presentation of information contained in its Group income statement and segment information note note 5, to present its share of post-tax profit of joint ventures after operating profit, but before profit before tax.
As a result of this change, the previously reported operating profit sub-total for 2013 is now reported as 83.8m previously 84.6m, with no change to the previously reported profit before tax, profit for the year, earnings per share or net financial position of the Group.
The Directors believe that this amendment provides a better understanding of the Groups operating profit and of its adjusted operating profit, which is one of the key non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice measures used to assess the underlying performance of the Group note 4.
2.4 Going concern As discussed in more detail in the Directors Report on page 80, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that theGroup has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, theyhave continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31December 2014.
2.5 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 25.1.
2.6 Disclosure of exceptional items IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed, encourages disclosure of additional line items where such presentation will assist in understanding financial performance and requires separate disclosure of material items of income or expense.
Accordingly, the Company discloses exceptional items separately on the face of its Group income statement, together with a full explanation of the nature and function of such items in the notes to the financial statements.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the item are considered in deciding whether an item warrants treatment as an exceptional item.
Such items may include, inter alia: the financial effect of major restructuring activity: profits or losses relating to current and non-current assets: gains or losses relating to employee benefit plans: profits or losses arising on business disposals: recognition and utilisation of deferred tax assets: and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Groups results either due to their size or nature.
COM ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 ALENT 91 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Basis of preparation continued 2.7 New and revised IFRS During the year a number of new and amended IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, including IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, none of which had a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
A number of new and amended IFRS were issued during the year, which do not become effective until after 1 January 2015, none of which is likely to have a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, totalcomprehensive income or earnings per share.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment tothe carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 Goodwill The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 2014, further details of which are given in note 17, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 3.0% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
3.2 Employee benefits The Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to current and former employees.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
The assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuary, and whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the Groups profit and financial position.
3.3 Liability reserves Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for theexpected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4 Taxation a Current tax Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement inconsidering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based upon the Directors interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.

COM STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION 3.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued 3.4 Taxation continued b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in thesefinancial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If operating or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced taxcharge.
Non-GAAP financial measures The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its businesses.
4.1 Net Sales Value NSV NSV is revenue less commodity metals that pass through to customers.
As the changes in the value of these commodity metals are passed through to customers, NSV is a more appropriate measure of the underlying activity ofthe business.
4.2 Return on sales and NSV margin Return on sales is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by revenue and NSV margin is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by NSV.
4.3 Adjusted results Adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted profit for the year and adjusted earnings per share are, where appropriate, each stated before: exceptional items: amortisation of acquired intangible assets: deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill: utilisation of deferred tax assets where initial recognition was as an exceptional item : acquisition costs: the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments and profits or losses arising on business disposals.
4.4 Adjusted cash generated from operations Adjusted cash generated from operations is cash generated from operations as reported in the Group statement ofcash flows after adding back 0.2m 2013: 4.8m for demerger cash costs note 9.
4.5 Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment and dividends from joint ventures but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
4.6 Average working capital to sales ratio The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the year.
Average working capital comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months.
COM ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 ALENT 93 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4.
Non-GAAP financial measures continued 4.7 EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of operating profit before exceptional items and depreciation charges.
4.8 Net interest Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be exceptional.
4.9 Interest cover Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
4.10 Net debt Net debt comprises the net total of: short-term deposits: cash at bank and in hand: bank overdrafts: and current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings net of capitalised borrowing costs.
4.11 Net debt to EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
4.12 Return on capital employed Return on capital employed ROCE is calculated as adjusted operating profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures, divided by average capital employed being total equity plus net debt, net defined benefit liability, income tax and deferred tax.
Segment information The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which can be found in note 4.
5.1 Accounting policy Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either ona stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and recovery of the related consideration is probable.
In practice this usually occurs when the goods have been delivered to, and accepted by, thecustomer.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.

Segment information continued 5.2 Business segments For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments, namely Assembly Materials and Surface Chemistries.
It is the Alent Board that makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments.
Theinformation used by the Board to review performance and determine resource allocation is presented with theGroups activities analysed between these two business segments.
Taking into account the basis on which the Groups activities are reported to the Alent Board and the nature of the products and services within each of these business segments, the Directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Groups results.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Business Unit Review on pages 16 to 17.
The Groups adjusted results note 4.3 have been used as the basis for presenting its segment results shown in the tables below.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material and segment result is operating profit before exceptional items and before corporate costs directly related to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below.
Segment result includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Income tax 11.1 Accounting policy Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, inwhich case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly to equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in theincome statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in otheryears and it further excludes items that are never taxable nor deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences anddeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against whichdeductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets andliabilities on a net basis.

The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2014, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.
Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 11.1.

As at 31 December 2014, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 5.0m 2013: 8.8m related to tax loss carryforwards on the basis that it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to recover the asset.
The period used for assessment of the recovery of the deferred tax asset was from between 1 to 3 years.
In determining this period the Directors took into account the uncertainty in the future profitability of the relevant operations and, in particular, whether or not those operations have a recent history of losses and have established a consistent track record of profits.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Group statement of cash flows.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Groups net debt and the amount at which it is reported in the Group balance sheet.
Property, plant and equipment 15.1 Accounting policy Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is therefore not charged on construction in progress.
Depreciation is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between 10 and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years other between 5 and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year-end.
As described in note 17.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing the sales proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement.

Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations.
16.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Research and development costs Research Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which itis incurred.
Development Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
Otherwise, it is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
In determining whether development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset or recognised in the income statement as an expense, management considers whether the strict intangible asset recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets, have been met at the time the expenditure is incurred.
In making this determination, management recognise that a significant portion of the development expenditure undertaken by the Group is focused on incremental improvements to existing products, as opposed to new or substantially improved products, and that for most of the Groups product developments commercial feasibility is not probable until acceptance by potential end customers, sofuture economic benefits from the developments are not often probable at the time the expenditure is incurred.

For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two CGUs: the Assembly Materials and Surface Chemistries businesses.
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.
COM ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 ALENT 107 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 17.1 Accounting policy At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where itis not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, toassess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these CGUs.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on detailed business plans covering a five year period from the balance sheet date.
The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
17.2 Key assumptions The key assumptions used in determining value in use are NSV margin, growth rates and discount rates.
NSV margin assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of electronics and automotive: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each CGU operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 3.0% 2013: 3.0% has been applied based upon external forecasts of the long-term growth rates experienced in the Groups end-market locations.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Assembly Materials CGU was 13.4% 2013:14.1% and for the Surface Chemistries CGU 11.3% 2013: 12.5%.
17.3 Goodwill impairment In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2014, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2014.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs andconsequently no impairment charges were recognised.

Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, orentering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represents a significant proportion of the total outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Groups trade and other receivable balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.

Inventories 19.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
19.2 Analysis of inventories 2014 2013 m m Raw materials 15.7 17.4 Work-in-progress 7.8 8.1 Finished goods 28.0 26.1 Total inventories 51.5 51.6 The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was 338.5m 2013: 378.5m.
As at 31 December 2014, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held 11.1m 2013: 10.1m of precious metals on consignment terms.
As the precious metals consignors retain title and associated risks and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the balance sheet.
Consequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in theGroup balance sheet.
Derivative financial instruments 20.1 Accounting policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in note 25.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement.
Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.

The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within operating profit.
When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within operating profit inthe income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.

After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement: and ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pounds sterling, itsresults and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used: and iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.

Based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.5m 2013: 0.3m and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.5m 2013: 0.3m.
Similarly, a 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in no change 2013: no change in the fair value of the Groups net debt.

Financial risk management continued 25.2 Financial risk factors continued b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
The level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this will normally be addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 300m 2013: 300m, of which 144.7m 2013: 145.5m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in September 2019.

Financial risk management continued 25.3 Capital management The Group monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and ROCE note 4.
The Groups objectives when managing its capital are: to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities: to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt: to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns: and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants and has substantial liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial Review on pages 39 to 40.
Employee benefits 26.1 Accounting policy a Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of its defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability, and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligations and the return on the plan assets, are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the year and taking into account changes in the net defined benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense is recognised in the Group income statement.
Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are also recognised in the Group income statement.
b Defined contribution plans The Group makes payments to defined contribution pension plans and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense in the Group income statement when they fall due.
26.2 Group post-retirement plans The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type.
a Defined benefit plans The Groups principal defined benefit pension plans are in the US.
The assets of the US plans are held outside the Group in funds administered by an investment committee comprised of senior Group executives, which takes advice from independent third party actuarial and investment advisors.
The investment committee is required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories, but these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.

Employee benefits continued 26.2 Group post-retirement plans continued The Groups US defined benefit plans are closed to new members and to future benefit accrual for existing members.
These plans provide retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
The main US plan, the Retirement Security Plan, has a minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members accounts.
The cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 26.3 a refers to this minimum return.
Actuarial valuations of the US plan are carried out annually by independent actuaries and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2013.
At that date, the market value of the plan assets was 43.6m, representing a funding level of 80% of funded accrued plan benefits of 54.8m.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit plan are determined by management after taking into account the results of the annual valuations of the plans, minimum funding levels prescribed by US government regulations and advice received from the Groups independent investment advisers.
In 2014, the Group made additional funding contributions in to its US defined benefit plans of 2.4m and is expected to make a similar level of contributions in 2015. b Defined contribution pension plans The total expense recognised for the Groups defined contribution pension plans and recognised in the Group income statement for the year amounted to 6.1m 2013: 5.8m.
26.3 Defined benefit obligation a Actuarial assumptions Actuarial assumptions are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Theprincipal assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension plans relate to the Groups US plans and these are summarised in the tables below.
2014 2013 Life expectancy of US pension plan members years years Age to which current pensioners are expected to live Men 86.6 85.1 Women 88.8 87.3 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live Men 88.3 87.2 Women 90.5 89.2 The mortality assumptions summarised in the table above are based on fully generational mortality tables that explicitly allow for differences in mortality levels and future trends in mortality, for people born in different years.
The other principal actuarial assumptions for the Groups US defined benefit pension plans are shown below.
Discount rate 3.60 4.50 Cash balance rate 5.25 5.25 The discount rates in the table above, which are used to determine the liabilities of the US plans, are determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds, using the Citigroup pension discount curve.
The cash balance rate is the minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group to members of its main US defined benefit plan.

This is accomplished by dividing the portfolio into return-seeking and liability-matching portfolios.
The return-seeking assets are designed to generate returns in excess of the change in the value of the plans projected liabilities and the liability-matching portfolio, comprised of high quality fixed income investments, is designed to match the change in value of the plans liabilities.
The mix at 31 December 2014 between return-seeking and liability-matching assets was approximately 40% 60%.
Other assets in the table above are principally comprised of cash.

Share-based payments 27.1 Accounting policy Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the liability is determined at each balance sheet date, and is expensed to the Group income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in liabilities.

Leases 29.1 Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Wherethe terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31December 2014 and 31 December 2013 was not material.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within operating profit, amounted to 6.2m 2013: 6.4m.
Provisions 30.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable thatthe Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Provisions continued 30.2 Analysis of provisions continued The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors best estimate of the costs to be incurred in connection with the sites of former Group businesses that were either closed or disposed of in prior years.
The provision as at 31 December 2014 principally comprised amounts payable in respect of environmental remediation and monitoring works, demolition and site clean-up costs, and associated regulatory liabilities.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five to ten years.
In 2014 the Group recognised litigation charges arising on settlement of legacy issues that pre-dated the demerger from Cookson Group plc in 2012.
Of these charges, 6.4m relates to the full and final settlement that was reached in February 2015 of actions brought by MacDermid incorporated in the United States against Alent and Vesuvius plc that arose out of corporate activity between the parties in 2006, and represents Alents share of the gross settlement.
Of the 6.8m provision held at the end of the year, 6.4m was paid in March 2015 and the balance of the provision is expected to befully utilised in 2015.
This matter had been noted as a contingent liability in Alents 2013 annual report and accounts.
Provisions for restructuring and other charges include the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to restructure its operating activities.
The balance of 6.4m as at 31 December 2014 includes 2.3m in relation to onerous leases terminating in between four and twelve years, and 3.8m in relation to other restructuring initiatives, all of which is expected to be paid out in 2015.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are inventory held under precious metal consignment arrangements note 19 and future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases note 29.
Contingent liabilities The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
