CSR in review Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Additional information Glossary ADR: negotiable certicate issued by a US bank representing a specified number of shares or one share in a foreign stock that is traded on a US exchange.
ADRs are denominated in US dollars, with the underlying security held by a US financial institution overseas.
ADRs help to reduce administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction ADS: a US dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock exchange.
American Depositary Shares ADSs are issued by depository banks in the US under agreement with the issuing foreign company: the entire issuance is called an American Depositary Receipt ADR and the individual shares are referred to as ADSs baseband: describing that part of a radio telecommunication system in which information is processed before modulating on to, or after demodulating off, a radio frequency RF carrier wave beacon: an indoor proximity positioning tool, typically Bluetooth Smart powered, that can notify nearby devices such as smartphones of its presence bill of materials: a list of the individual parts or material which comprise a nished product and the cost of each of those individual parts Bluetooth: is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from xed and mobile devices Bluetooth Smart formerly known as Bluetooth low energy or BTLE : is designed to work side-by-side with and complement Bluetooth.
It operates in 2.4 GHz ISM band.
Devices using ultra low power Bluetooth will be smaller and more energy-efficient than their Bluetooth counterparts chip: short for a microchip: semiconductor device or integrated circuit cloud: in common usage, the term the cloud is essentially a metaphor for the Internet: the phrase in the cloud can refer software, platforms and infrastructure that are sold as a service, i. e. remotely through the Internet.
codec: short for compressor decompressor, a codec is any technology for compressing and decompressing data.
Codecs can be implemented in software, hardware or a combination of both.
Some popular codecs for computer video include MPEG and Indeo.
In telecommunications it is short for coder decoder, a device that encodes or decodes a signal.
For example, telephone companies use codecs to convert binary signals transmitted on their digital networks to analog signals converted on their analog networks connectivity: enabling two electronic devices to communicate with each other and transfer data voice audio music picture word les using radio waves Console: a computer game console is a device that outputs a video signal to display a video game: it can be a machine designed for consumers to use for playing video games on a television, or home computer, or it can be in the form of a handheld game console CSR Group: CSR plc and its subsidiaries design win: CSR records a design win when a product using one of its ICs becomes qualied digital: the representation of data by a series of bits or discrete values such as 0s and 1s fabless: short for fabricationless, a business model used in the semiconductor industry, where the manufacture or fabrication of ICs is subcontracted to a foundry fabless semiconductor company: company that uses a third party semiconductor fabrication service to manufacture silicon chips as opposed to fabrication facilities owned directly foundry: a semiconductor manufacturing site that makes integrated circuits gaming: a term describing the playing a video, internet or computer game GNSS: A satellite navigation system system of satellites that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage.
It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location longitude, latitude, and altitude to high precision within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites: the signals also allow the electronic receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system or GNSS GPS: Global Positioning Systems: a satellite based radio navigation system that allows receiving devices to take an accurate location x of the device on the surface of the earth.
Positions are derived by measuring the time of arrival of signals broadcast from the constellation of satellites, and knowledge of the instantaneous positions of the satellites.
The information required to calculate this being broadcast at a very low data rate by the satellites themselves, and is known as almanac and ephemeris data HID: Human Interface Device: a computer device that interacts directly with and often takes input from humans and may deliver data to humans IC or integrated circuit: a semiconductor device consisting of many thousands or millions of interconnected transistors and other components indoor location: positioning and navigation in locations such as shopping centres, airports, convention centres, and other pedestrian areas Infotainment: term and popular buzzword for a media device or service that delivers a combination of information and entertainment.
The content delivered via infotainment is designed to be informative yet entertaining enough to attract and maintain the consumers interest IoT: Internet of Things: a computing concept that describes a future where everyday physical objects will be connected to the internet and be able to identify themselves to other devices ISO: International Standards Organisation: the international organisation responsible for developing and maintaining worldwide standards for manufacturing, environmental management systems, computers, data communications, and many other elds www.

negatively affect the environment i. e. cause adverse changes to air, water, or land : b comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements, and c continually improve in the aforementioned matters ISO 9000: a series of international standards for quality assurance in business practices, ratied by the ISO beginning in 1987.
Certication of ISO 9000 compliance is important for selling many types of goods and services including data-communications equipment and services low latency: low latency concerns the management of delays that occur between an input and a corresponding output that reduces them to such an extent as to render them unnoticeable to the human eye or ear.
In respect of CSRs new audio coding technology it reduces the delay, or latency, of stereo audio signals over Bluetooth connectivity, effectively enabling consumers to watch video while listening to synchronised wireless audio memory: any device that can store data in machine-readable format which may include RAM, ROM and Flash ODM: or Original Design Manufacturer: a manufacturer that designs and manufactures equipment for another company who will, in turn sell this to the end-user OEM: or Original Equipment Manufacturer: a manufacturer that sells equipment to retail and wholesale outlets OSHAS 18001: is a British Standard for occupational health and safety management systems: it exists to help organisations put in place demonstrably sound occupational health and safety performance: it is widely seen as the worlds most recognised occupational health and safety management systems standard PC: personal computer Personal Navigation Device or PND: is a portable electronic product which combines a positioning capability such as GPS and navigation functions and enables the user to nd out where they are located and get directions to move from one place to another package: the package of a semiconductor is the physical and electrical interface between the chip and the system in which it operates platform: a set of hardware and software that provides the core functionality of an end product or a subsystem within the end product e. g. an auto navigation platform consists of an Embedded Processor OS with visualisation capabilities GPS combined with navigation algorithms and necessary peripherals: a smartphone platform consists of an Apps Processor OS Modem combined with voice, visualisation & data communication protocols and necessary peripherals: a wireless audio platform consists of an audio DSP Bluetooth or another wireless link combined with audio algorithms and necessary peripherals product qualication: the approval of a product or process for use by an ODM or OEM protocol: a method by which two dissimilar systems can communicate SA 8000: is an auditable certication standard that encourages organisations to develop, maintain, and apply socially acceptable practices in the workplace.
