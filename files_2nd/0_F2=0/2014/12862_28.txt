Significant accounting policies Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
In the income statement, the Group presents specific adjusting items separately.
In the judgment of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately because of their size and nature.
Specific adjusting items include: amortisation of intangibles arising from acquisitions: pension curtailment gains losses: pension gain on closure to future accrual and associated Scheme-closure mitigation costs: pension net finance expense: gains losses on business divestments and disposal of investments: restructuring costs: gains losses on disposal of property: impairment of property: impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: and tax on the above items.
Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements, approved by the Directors, have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Directors Report on page 59 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on page 147.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and other relevant financial assets and liabilities.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 100,000.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2014.
The purchase method of accounting has been adopted.
Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost usually on acquisition and disposal respectively.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies in order to obtain benefits.
Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when determining control.
The Group comprises certain entities that are operated under the management of a Proxy Board.
Details of the Proxy Board arrangements and the powers of the proxy holders and QinetiQ management are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report.
IAS 27 is the accounting standard currently applicable in respect of consolidation of entities.
This does not specifically deal with proxy situations.
However, having considered the terms of the Proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies of such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities in the consolidated accounts.
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of financial and operating policy.
A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount.
Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Groups share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies.
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.
Revenue Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added taxes and other sales taxes on the following bases: Service contracts The Groups service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue.
Revenue is recognised once the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated.
When the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared with the estimated total contract costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
The Group generally does not undertake construction contracts.

Significant accounting policies continued Goods sold Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.
Royalties and intellectual property Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates.
Intellectual property revenue can be attributed either to perpetual licences or to limited licences.
Limited licences are granted for a specified period and revenue is recognised over the period of the licence.
Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited time frames and revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
Segmental information Segmental information is presented according to the Groups internal management reporting structure and the markets in which it operates.
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group.
Corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Unallocated items mainly comprise specific adjusting items.
Specific adjusting items are referred to in note 4.
Eliminations represent inter-company trading between the different segments.
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
Research and development expenditure R&D costs incurred on behalf of a customer as part of a specific project are directly chargeable to the customer on whose behalf the work is undertaken.
These costs are recognised within operating costs and revenue is recognised in respect of the R&D services performed.
Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project.
Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
All other R&D costs are expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed.
Financing Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial income earned on funds invested.
Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement are included within finance income and finance expense.
Financing also includes the net finance expense in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Taxation The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the relevant tax is charged or credited to equity.
Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Any changes in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
Discontinued operation A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
106 106 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 QinetiQ Group plcAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Additional information Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.
Intangible assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, typically between one and nine years.
Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.
Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation.
Intangible assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: Intellectual property rights 28 years Development costs 14 years Other 19 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: Freehold buildings 2025 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease Plant and machinery 310 years Fixtures and fittings 510 years Computers 35 years Motor vehicles 35 years Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and interest.
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible, goodwill, intangible and held for sale assets At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash-generating unit CGU are written down to their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.
Investments in debt and equity securities Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available for sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss, other than impairment losses, being recognised directly in equity.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.
Inventories Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost.
Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost.
Bid costs Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred.
In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding process typically involves a competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close with the customer.
In these cases, the costs incurred after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress.
From the point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life of the contract.
If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs deferred to that point will be expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not be achieved.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced.
Payments received on account are included in trade and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised.

Significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash.
In the cash flow statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents.
Current and non-current liabilities Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group.
Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet.
Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method.
If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate reflecting the level of risk and the time value of money.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The fide-recognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires, or when the instrument is sold, terminated or exercised.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments.
Fair value hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability.
Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments and fair value at the inception of the lease.
Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates.
Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction.
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Post-retirement benefits The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined using the projected unit credit method.
Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out bi-annually.
Actuarial advice is provided by external consultants.
For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively.
108 108 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 QinetiQ Group plcAnnual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Additional information For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and past service cost.
The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses and re-measurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share-based payments The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse.
The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.
Share capital Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs.
Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid.
They are classified as own shares within equity.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.
Recent accounting developments Developments adopted by the Group in 2014 with no material impact on the financial statements The following EU-endorsed amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2013 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Note that QinetiQ adopted IAS19 revised in the prior year: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement new standard replacing existing guidance on fair value measurement in different IFRSs with a single definition of fair value.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amendments revising the way both other comprehensive income and comparative information are presented.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS amendments relating to government grants, hyperinflation and fixed dates.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments amendments relating to asset and liability offsetting.
Annual improvements 2011 annual improvements cycle including amendments to IAS 16, IAS 32 and IAS 34.
Developments expected in future periods of which the impact is being assessed FRS 100, 101 and 102: FRS 100, 101 and 102 all fall under the new UK GAAP regime.
FRS 100 sets out the application of financial reporting requirements in the UK and Republic of Ireland and FRS 101, known as IFRS with reduced disclosures, outlines the reduced disclosure framework available for use by qualifying entities choosing to follow the principles of IFRS but under the umbrella of UK GAAP.
FRS 102 is applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and is known as the new UK GAAP.
FRS 102 follows more closely the principles of existing UK GAAP with some exceptions.
The mandatory effective date for the new framework of reporting is for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
The Group can choose to apply either full IFRS, or a choice of either FRS 101 or FRS 102 to the Company and to its subsidiary entities.
The two latter options both fall under UK GAAP and either may therefore be applied to Group companies on an entity by entity basis.
If full IFRS is selected, this must be applied to all Group companies consistently.
The Group is likely to choose the UK GAAP option and is currently undertaking a full analysis on an individual company basis as to whether FRS 101 or FRS 102 is appropriate.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The Group awaits the final publication of the new IFRS standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is expected to be published imminently.
The new standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
It will become effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2017 at the earliest and will therefore be applied for the first time to the Group accounts in 2018: the IASB has indicated that early adoption will not be permitted.
The Group has begun a systematic review of all existing major contracts to ensure that the impact and effect of the new standard is fully understood and any changes to current accounting procedures are highlighted and acted upon well in advance of the effective date.
Leases: During 2014 the IASB and FASB discussed fundamental aspects of their lease accounting proposals published in 2013, covering both lessee and lessor accounting, and potential simplifications to the accounting models.
Although both accounting bodies remain committed to on-balance sheet recognition of leases by lessees, the IASB and FASB could not agree on key aspects of the proposals.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: Refer to the Critical accounting estimates section on page 110.
Developments expected in future periods with no material impact on the Groups financial statements The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following new, revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group when they become applicable in future periods: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Investments in Associates: and Amendments to new standards IFRS 10, 11, 12 and 27: Amendments to IAS 36 and 39.

Significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of management judgment required in their application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for the Group.
The level of management judgment required includes assumptions and estimates about future events that are uncertain and the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from that anticipated.
Assets businesses held for sale Post year end, on 22 April 2014, the Group entered into an agreement, subject to shareholder approval and normal closing conditions, to sell the US Services business.
Whether or not to classify this business as held for sale as at 31 March 2014 is a matter of judgment and has a significant impact on the presentation of the financial statements.
The Directors are of the opinion that completion of the disposal transaction was not highly probable as at 31 March 2014 and the criteria of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Activities had not been met.
Accordingly, the US Services business has not been reported as an asset held for sale.
Additional financial information in respect of this business is disclosed in note 33 Post balance sheet events.
Revenue and profit recognition The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources required and other factors.
This process is carried out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work.
No profit is recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated.
Business combinations Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its CGUs which may differ from the actual results delivered.
In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Further details on the sensitivity of the carrying value of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 12.
Consolidation of US subsidiaries As described on page 61, the Group and the US Department of Defense DoD have entered into a Proxy agreement that regulates the ownership, management and operation of certain Group subsidiaries.
Having considered the terms of the Proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies of such entities and, therefore, consolidates the subsidiaries in the consolidated accounts.
The key principle of the new standard IFRS10, effective in future periods, is that control exists, and consolidation is required, only if the investor i possesses power over the investee, ii has exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and iii has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The impact of this new standard on future reporting periods is being assessed.
Tax In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality, inflation and future salary and pension increases.
Management exercises its best judgment, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group.
Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the deficit or the net income statement costs.
Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the retirement benefit obligation recognised.
Further details of these assumptions are set out in note 28.

Profit loss before tax The following items have been charged in arriving at profit loss before tax: all figures in million 2014 2013 Fees payable to the auditor and its associates: Audit of the Groups annual accounts 0.6 0.6 Audit of the accounts of subsidiaries of the Company and its associated pension scheme 0.5 0.2 Audit-related assurance services 0.1 0.1 Other assurance services 0.2 Corporate finance services due diligence support 1.3 All other non-audit services Total auditors remuneration 2.7 0.9 Included within this amount is 0.3 million in respect of the audit of prior year US Services division financial statements.
The fees payable to auditors were significantly greater in 2014 than 2013 due to the fact that KPMG were engaged to perform work in connection with the strategic review and preparation for the proposed sale of the US Services division.
This included audit of prior year US Services division financial statements and acting as reporting accountant for the Class 1 circular.

Factors affecting future tax charges The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development relief in the UK.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to the impact of any tax legislation changes and the geographic mix of profits.
The Finance Act 2013 allows the continued recognition of R&D tax credits as a super deduction in the tax line until April 2016, when R&D Expenditure Credit treatment becomes mandatory, which could increase the Groups effective tax rate over time to a blend of the US and UK corporation tax rates.
Previously, the UK Government announced reductions to the UK corporation tax rate to 21% on 1 April 2014 and to 20% on 1 April 2015 and these were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
Deferred tax has been calculated at 21% being the tax rate effective for the financial year to 31 March 2015.
The subsequent change to 20% will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced rate reduction to 20% in 2015, although this will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax accordingly.
At 31 March 2014 the Group had unused tax losses of 191.4m 2013: 202.7m potentially available for offset against future profits.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 26.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.
Underlying basic earnings per share figures are presented below, in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share, because the Directors consider this gives a more relevant indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the impact of specific adjusting items see note 4 and tax thereon.

Goodwill continued Goodwill as at 31 March 2014 was allocated across various CGUs in the following segments: EMEA Services three, Global Products two and US Services one.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances.
The Group tests each CGU for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgments, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs with the exception of US Services and US Global Products, discussed below, and management considers that there are no likely variations in the key assumptions which would lead to an impairment being recognised in any of the other CGUs.
US Services CGU A strategic review was announced in May 2013 to determine the route to maximise the performance and value of US Services.
This concluded with the decision to dispose of the CGU and a sale was agreed post year end see note 33.
As at 31 March 2014 the Group intended to realise value from US Services via sale rather than use.
An impairment loss has been recognised at year end based on a comparison of the US Services goodwill with its recoverable amount, being fair value less costs to sell.
Fair value has been determined by taking the initial cash consideration for the disposal of $165m together with a potential earn out of up to $50m in cash.
The earn out is scheduled to be payable no earlier than 1 April 2015 on a sliding scale between zero and $50m based on gross profit generated by the US Services division between $100m and $132m in the financial year ending 31 March 2015.
Management estimates have been used to determine the value of the likely earn out.
The re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell resulted in an impairment loss of 84.0m.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 2014, after impairment, was 41.4m and its net operating assets excluding goodwill were 55.6m.
The Cyveillance business, which previously formed part of US Services, was excluded from the strategic review and was separated out from US Services during 2014.
Goodwill of 4.6m was allocated to this new CGU and it has significant headroom as at 31 March 2014.
An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The CGU sits within EMEA Services.
Key assumptions for other CGUs Cash flows The value-in-use calculations generally use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a twoyear period.
Discounted cash flows for the US Global Products CGU were based on a Board-approved three-year plan, reflecting increases in revenue from new product lines.
Cash flows for periods beyond these periods are extrapolated based on the last year of the plans, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0% 3.0% 2013: 2.0% 3.0%.
Growth rates are based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for risks specific to the market characteristics of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
This is considered to appropriately estimate a market participant discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for the three EMEA Services CGUs were 11.5%, 15.6% and 18.3% and for the Global Products CGUs 10.1% and 11.4%.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the value of the terminal year cash flow, the discount rate and the terminal growth rates have a significant impact on the value of the discounted cash flow.
The performance of Global Products was impacted by the drawdown of overseas US military forces.
The value in use of the US Global Products CGU, calculated using the key assumptions discussed above, was lower than the carrying value of the CGUs net operating assets which resulted in an impairment of 41.9m.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a 33% decrease in the terminal year cash flow would result in an increase in the impairment charge of 24.4m.
Sensitivity analysis also shows that a decrease or increase of 1% in the discount rate assumption would result in an impairment of 25.6m or 53.3m respectively.
Sensitivity analysis also shows that a decrease or increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate would result in an impairment of 52.5m or 27.9m.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 2014, after impairment, was 60.0m and its net operating assets excluding goodwill were 12.8m.
The UK Global Products CGU and the individual CGUs within EMEA Services all have significant headroom.
The carrying value of goodwill for the UK Global Products CGU as at 31 March was 5.5m.
The carrying values of goodwill for the three EMEA Services CGUs as at 31 March were 27.5m, 2.3m and 4.6m.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions between 31 March 2014 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US defence and other government agencies.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no credit provision in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts is required.
As at 31 March 2014 the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts of 2.9m 2013: 1.9m.

Redundancy provisions are expected to be utilised within 12 months and provisions in respect of vacant property will be utilised in line with the remaining lease period.
Lease periods extend out to 2019.
Property provisions, other than those relating to restructuring discussed above, relate to under-utilised properties in the UK.
The extent of the provision is affected by the timing of when properties can be sub-let and the proportion of space that can be sub-let.
Based on current assessment the provision will be utilised within 12 years.
Other provisions relate to environmental and other liabilities, the magnitude and timing of utilisation of which are determined by a variety of factors.

Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
There have been no changes in any risk management policies since the year end.
A Fair values of financial instruments The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 2 derivatives comprise forward foreign exchange contracts which have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market: and Level 3 measured using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.

For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value.
There have been no transfers between levels.

The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30%80% of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings.
Where there are significant changes in the level and or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.
At 31 March 2014 100% 2013: 100% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates with no adjustment for interest rate swaps.

Financial risk management continued C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.
Functional currency of the operating company Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities all figures in millions Total US$ Euro AUS$ Other 31 March 2014 sterling 18.1 2.2 2.1 0.6 17.6 31 March 2013 sterling 0.9 2.5 1.5 1.9 1.8 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2014 against sterling are net US dollars sold 17.0m US$28.3m and net euros sold 8.3m 10.1m.
Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency or, in some cases, indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by a Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits.
In the normal course of business the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 329.0m 2013: 248.8m.
The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 322.2m at 31 March 2014 2013: 240.4m, which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets.
The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rated single A or better, although 218.5m 2013: 207.8m was invested in AAA-rated money funds at the year end and 50m was invested in deposits collateralised by security, where the security was gilts.
E Liquidity risk Borrowing facilities As at 31 March 2014 the Group had a revolving credit facility RCF of US$250m and 118m 2013: US$250m and 118m.

The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in the global financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2014, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2014, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The figures shown in the table relate primarily to the translational impact on the Groups US$ debt.
This debt is held in the US so there is no transactional impact.

The carrying amount of the liability of the grants at the balance sheet date was 1.7m 2013: 1.8m.
Of the awards outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable.
Share-based award pricing other Share-based awards that vest based on non-market performance conditions, including certain PSP, RSUs and DAB awards, have been valued at the share price at grant, less attrition.
For the 2003 ESOS, there was a pre-bonus issue weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately before the issue of the share options.
Before the IPO in February 2006, there was no active market for the Companys shares and expected volatility was, therefore, determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
Since the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments at this time, no dividends were assumed in this model.

Post-retirement benefits Defined contribution plans In the UK the Group operates two Group Personal Pension Plans GPPs for the majority of its UK employees.
These are defined contribution schemes managed by Zurich.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third-party financial provider.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit pension plans In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme the Scheme for a significant proportion of its UK employees.
The Scheme closed to future accrual on 31 October 2013.
After this date, defined benefit members transferred to a defined contribution scheme.
On closure, the Group realised a reduction in scheme liabilities of 31.1m and a one-off cost of 4.0m arising from associated contributions to affected members defined contribution plans following the closure of the scheme.
The Scheme is a final salary plan, which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on the members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the Scheme, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The benefit payments are made from Trustee-administered funds.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by UK regulations as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for the governance of the Scheme including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemes regulations.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and final pensionable earnings.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated bi-annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
The expected employer cash contribution to the Scheme for the year ending 31 March 2015 is 17.1m 2014: 20.6m, including a 6.0m one-off contribution following the disposal of US Services.
Following the closure to future accrual, future reporting periods will no longer include an expense in respect of defined benefit pension service costs.
Triennial funding valuation The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2011 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 74.7m.
On the basis of this full valuation, the Trustees of the Scheme and the Company agreed the employer contribution rate of 12.7% from 30 June 2011, past service deficit recovery payments of 10.5m a year for a six-year period from 1 April 2013 and an immediate one-off contribution of 40m into the Scheme.
As part of a package of measures to provide stability to the Scheme, the Company has also contributed an asset in the form of an interest through a Scottish limited partnership see below in a future income stream of approximately 2.5m per annum, increasing in line with the CPI, for 20 years secured on certain properties owned by the Group.
The next scheduled triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2014.
The funding basis of calculating Scheme funding requirements differs from IAS 19 in that it does not use corporate bonds as a basis for the discount rate but instead uses the risk free rate from UK gilts, prudently adjusted for long-term expected returns for pre-retireds.
Given the current extremely low gilt yields, perhaps exacerbated by quantitative easing, a funding valuation of the Scheme would probably have resulted in a bigger deficit than the IAS 19 methodology if it had been performed at the year end.

Post-retirement benefits continued QinetiQs Pension Funding Partnership Structure Following the 30 June 2011 valuation, a package of pension changes has been agreed with the Trustees to provide stability to the Scheme.
As part of the package of proposals, on 26 March 2013 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership the Partnership with the Scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to the capitalised value of 32.3m were transferred to the Partnership.
The transfers were affected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 2.5m for 20 years: indexed with reference to CPI.
These contributions replaced part of the regular contributions made under the past deficit recovery payments plan.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership will revert back to QinetiQ Limited in 2032.
The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group.
Under IAS 19, the interest held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.
As a result, the Groups consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership.
In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet.
QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2014 amounted to nil 2013: nil.
QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.
QinetiQ Pension Scheme net pension liability The fair value of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the Schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: all figures in million 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Equities 434.4 487.3 583.2 564.1 714.6 LDI investment 273.6 205.9 Corporate bonds 279.9 276.8 194.6 158.7 69.5 Alternative bonds 183.0 174.8 Government bonds 183.5 165.3 69.6 Property 94.0 81.3 82.4 78.0 53.4 Other 39.7 30.4 64.2 15.0 8.8 Total market value of assets 1,304.6 1,256.5 1,107.9 981.1 915.9 Present value of Scheme liabilities 1,326.8 1,310.6 1,139.4 1,105.7 1,063.2 Net pension liability before deferred tax 22.2 54.1 31.5 124.6 147.3 Deferred tax asset 1.3 13.7 13.3 32.4 41.2 Net pension liability 20.9 40.4 18.2 92.2 106.1 The Scheme has assets invested in a Liability Driven Investment portfolio.

Post-retirement benefits continued Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual Scheme differences were: 2014 2013 Discount rate applied to Scheme liabilities 4.2% 4.4% CPI inflation assumption 2.6% 2.7% Assumed life expectancies in years: Future male pensioners currently aged 60 88 88 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 90 90 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 90 90 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 92 92 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, because of the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are measured by external market indicators.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 March 2014 were 90% of S1PMA for males and 100% of S1PFA for females, based on year of birth making allowance for improvements in mortality in line with CMI 2011 Core Projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
These assumptions are the same as in the prior year.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 20 years.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure Scheme liabilities Indicative impact on Scheme liabilities Assumption Change in assumption before deferred tax Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 25m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 25m Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 31m The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method projected unit credit method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumption did not change.
Risks Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Volatility in market Results under IAS 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions.
The defined benefit conditions obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, while many of the assets of the Scheme are invested in other assets.
Changing markets in conjunction with discount rate volatility will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.
Choice of accounting The calculation of the defined benefit obligation DBO involves projecting future cash flows from the assumptions Scheme many years into the future.
This means that the assumptions used can have a material impact on the balance sheet position and profit and loss charge.
In practice future experience within the Scheme may not be in line with the assumptions adopted.
For example, members could live longer than foreseen or inflation could be higher or lower than allowed for in the DBO calculation.
Inflation rate risk The majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments into the Scheme.
The payments into the Scheme are reassessed after every triennial valuation.
The triennial valuations are calculated on a funding basis and use a different set of assumptions, as agreed with the pension Trustees.

Transactions with the MOD The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 26.
Transactions between the Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows: Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Groups acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
i Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets see below include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
ii Property claw-back agreement During the 12 years from 1 July 2001, following a trigger event, the MOD was entitled to claw-back a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation.
This agreement expired in the year to 31 March 2014.
MODs generic compliance regime Adherence to the generic compliance system is monitored by the Risk & CSR Committee.
Refer to the Corporate Governance Report on page 67.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2014 was 1.3m 2013: 1.4m.
Long-Term Partnering Agreement On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide Test and Evaluation T&E facilities and training support services to the MOD.
This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to 5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery.
Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 40.3m at 31 March 2014 2013: 54.3m in the ordinary course of business.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as not probable.
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration is potentially due on the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.
The Group has also not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to property impairments in prior years that may potentially be recovered from the MOD.
Recovery is subject to future negotiations.
It is not considered practicable to calculate the value of this contingent asset.

4 Sale agreed post year end.
Post balance sheet events On 22 April 2014, the Group agreed to sell the US Services division, comprising QinetiQ North America Inc. and its subsidiaries, for an initial cash consideration of $165m plus potential deferred consideration of up to $50m.
As at 31 March 2014 negotiations to conclude the transaction were still ongoing, with significant terms still unresolved.
As such the Directors are of the opinion that the successful conclusion to the transaction was not highly probable as at 31 March 2014.
The financial reporting implications of which are that the US Services division cannot be presented as an asset held for sale as at the balance sheet date, and the results of US Services are not reported as a discontinued operation within the income statement.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had the intention to realise value from US Services via sale rather than use and an impairment loss to goodwill has been recognised in 2014 following valuation at fair value less costs to sell.
The full impact of the disposal, including the remaining transaction costs, estimated warranty indemnity liabilities, completion bonuses change of control payments, and deferred foreign exchange gains losses recycled from reserves, will be shown in the accounts for the year ending 31 March 2015, subject to transaction completion.
