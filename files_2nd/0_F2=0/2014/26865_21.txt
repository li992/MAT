Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses on foreign currency, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Investment holding gains.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of any withholding tax.
Special dividends are looked at individually to ascertain the reason behind the payment.
This will determine whether they are treated as income or capital.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Underwriting commission is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
Underwriting commission is recognised in revenue where it relates to shares that the Company is not required to take up.
Where the Company is required to take up a proportion of the shares underwritten, the same proportion of commission received is deducted from the cost of the shares taken up, with the balance taken to revenue.
Property income distributions are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.

g Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and term deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprises forward exchange contract, the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Companys investing activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be received or paid.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value Added Tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year Overseas withholding tax 312 32 Current tax charge for the year 312 32 b Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2013: lower than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 23.16% 2013: 24.33%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2014 2013 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 46,958 323,849 370,807 31,675 257,722 289,397 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 23.16% 2013: 24.33% 10,875 75,003 85,878 7,707 62,704 70,411 Effect of: Non taxable scrip dividends 6 6 86 86 Non taxable UK dividend income 9,811 9,811 6,380 6,380 Non taxable overseas dividend income 1,942 1,942 2,165 2,165 Non taxable capital gains 77,860 77,860 65,422 65,422 Unrelieved expenses 884 2,857 3,741 924 2,718 3,642 Overseas withholding tax 312 312 32 32 312 312 32 32 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 40,941,000 2013: 43,368,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 20% 2013: 23%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 3rd July 2012 and is effective from 1st April 2013.
The Government has also enacted future reductions in the main rate of tax down to 21% by 1st April 2014, and 20% by 1st April 2015.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The Company has no significant direct exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares and other securities, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are reset.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys gearing policy is to limit gearing within the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared where gearing is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
JPM Mercantile pp44 61 JPM Mercantile pp44 61 01 04 2014 11:46 Page 57 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 57 The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances and there is an overdraft facility available when required.
The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset, is shown below: 2014 2013 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank and short term deposits 27,211 139,879 Total exposure 27,211 139,879 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2013: same.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances and drawings on the loan facility have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum net cash balances during the year are as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 139,836 191,707 Minimum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 27,211 18,447 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2013: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,831,759 1,417,134 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 15 to 18.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2013: 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.
2014 2013 10% Increase 10% Decrease 10% Increase 10% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 275 275 213 213 Capital return 182,535 182,535 141,227 141,227 Total return after taxation 182,260 182,260 141,014 141,014 Net assets 182,260 182,260 141,014 141,014 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.

The outflow of cash in connection with the debenture stock could occur earlier if the Company were to repurchase debentures for cancellation or if the Company goes into default and the security is enforced.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued c Credit risk continued Management of credit risk continued Exposure to JPMorgan Chase Bank JPMorgan Chase Bank is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chase Banks own trading assets and are therefore protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase Bank were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all of the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The following amounts shown in the Balance Sheet, represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.

d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at fair value or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture stock which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture stock has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield on a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys debt and capital structure comprises the following: 2014 2013 000 000 Debt 175 million 6.125% debenture stock 25th February 2030 173,437 173,340 3.85 million 4.25% perpetual debenture stock 3,850 3,850 177,287 177,190 Equity Called up share capital 24,560 24,614 Reserves 1,663,350 1,336,819 1,687,910 1,361,433 Total debt and equity 1,865,197 1,538,623 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 10% net cash to 20% geared.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as the excess amount above shareholders funds of Total Assets including net current assets liabilities less cash cash equivalents, expressed as a percentage of net assets.

This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the opportunity for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the level of dividend distributions in excess of that which is required to be distributed.
Subsequent events The Directors have evaluated the period since the year end and have not noted any subsequent events.
