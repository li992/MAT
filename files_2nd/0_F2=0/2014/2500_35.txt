132 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 2 Segmental analyses As the chief operating decision maker, the Management Board reviews external revenues and adjusted profit from operations to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources to the overall business.
The results of next-generation products as a separate segment are currently not material to the Group and are included within the Western Europe region.
Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.
The four geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Groups internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources.
The Management Board reviews current and prior year segmental revenue, adjusted profit from operations of subsidiaries and joint operations, and adjusted post-tax results of associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange.
The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group, including inter-company royalties payable in foreign currency to UK entities.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, which will be fully disclosed, it does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates.
As a result, the 2014 segmental results were translated using the 2013 rates of exchange.
The 2013 figures are stated at the 2013 rates of exchange and are, therefore, unadjusted from those published for 2013.

e Restructuring and integration costs Restructuring costs reflect the costs incurred as a result of initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise, including the relevant operating costs of implementing the new operating model.
These costs represent additional expenses incurred which are not related to the normal business and day-to-day activities.
The new operating model includes revised organisation structures, standardised processes and shared back office services underpinned by a global single instance of SAP.
The new organisation structures and processes are currently being implemented and the deployment of the new SAP system started in the third quarter of 2012 and will take around a total of four years to fully roll-out.
These initiatives also include a review of the Groups manufacturing operations, supply chain, overheads and indirect costs, organisational structure and systems and software used.
The costs of these initiatives together with the costs of integrating acquired businesses into existing operations, including acquisition costs, are included in profit from operations under the following headings: 2014 2013 m m Employee benefit costs 223 140 Depreciation and impairment costs 69 11 Other operating expenses 180 161 Other operating income 20 66 452 246 136 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 3 Profit from operations continued Restructuring and integration costs in 2014 principally relate to the restructuring initiatives directly related to implementation of a new operating model and the cost of packages in respect of permanent headcount reductions and permanent employee benefit reductions in the Group.
The costs also cover factory closure and downsizing activities in Australia, Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and restructurings in Argentina, Indonesia, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.
Restructuring and integration costs in 2013 principally related to restructuring initiatives directly related to implementation of a new operating model and the continuation of the factory closure and downsizing activities in Australia and Russia, and restructuring of factories in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Switzerland and Germany.
The costs also covered packages in respect of permanent headcount reductions and permanent employee benefit reductions in the Group.
Other operating income in 2014 includes gains from the sale of land and buildings in Turkey, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2013, other operating income includes gains from the sale of land and buildings in Australia, Denmark and Russia.
f Amortisation of trademarks and similar intangibles The acquisitions of Protabaco, Bentoel, Tekel, ST, CN Creative Limited and the creation of CTBAT International Limited see note 26 a resulted in the capitalisation of trademarks and similar intangibles which are amortised over their expected useful lives, which do not exceed 20 years.
The amortisation charge of 58 million 2013: 74 million is included in depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs in profit from operations.
g Gain on deemed partial disposal of a trademark The contribution of the State Express 555 brand to CTBAT International Limited in 2013 see note 26 a is accounted for at fair value in the arrangement.
This resulted in a 26 million gain on a deemed partial disposal of a trademark which is included in other operating income but has been treated as an adjusting item.
h Fox River As explained in note 30, a Group subsidiary has certain liabilities in respect of indemnities given on the purchase and disposal of former businesses in the United States and in 2011, the Group provided 274 million in respect of claims in relation to environmental clean-up costs of the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, a Group subsidiary, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into the Funding Agreement with regard to the costs for Fox River.
Based on this Funding Agreement, 56 million has been paid with legal costs incurred of 7 million.
The Fox River provision has been reviewed and 27 million has been released in 2014 see note 22 and note 30. i Flintkote As explained in note 30, in December 2014, a Group subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement in connection with various legal cases related to a former non-tobacco business in Canada.
Under the terms of the settlement, the subsidiary will obtain protection from current and potential future Flintkote-related asbestos liability claims in the US.
The settlement is contingent upon further documentation and approval of certain courts in the US.
This agreement has led to a charge of 374 million in 2014.

ITC decreased from 30.47% to 30.26% as a result of ITC issuing ordinary shares under the companys Employee Share Option Scheme.
The issue of these shares and change in the Groups share of ITC resulted in a gain of 14 million, which is treated as a deemed partial disposal and included in the Income Statement.
Reynolds American Inc. RAI recognised a net gain from discontinued activities of US$25 million, reduced by restructuring activities of US$16 million, resulting in a net gain of US$9 million.
The Groups share of this net gain amounted to 4 million net of tax.
As explained in note 5 b, under the Master Settlement Agreement MSA in the US, in June 2014, a further two states entered into a settlement agreement in relation to disputed NPM Adjustment Claims for the years 2003 to 2012.
Under the settlement, RAI expects to receive more than US$170 million in MSA credits to be applied over five years.
During 2014, RAI recognised income of US$34 million related to the 2013 liability as an adjusting item.
The Groups share of this income amounted to 5 million net of tax.
Credits in respect of the 2014 liability and future years would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items.
RAI has also recognised amounts which have been combined in the table of adjusting items in the Group Income Statement and are shown as other.
These are costs in respect of a number of Engle progeny lawsuits and other tobacco litigation charges that amount to US$102 million, the Groups share of which is 16 million net of tax.
In 2013, the Groups interest in ITC decreased from 30.72% to 30.47% as a result of ITC issuing ordinary shares under the companys Employee Share Option Scheme.
This resulted in a gain of 22 million, which was treated as a deemed partial disposal and included in the Income Statement.
During 2013, RAI recognised restructuring charges of US$24 million and the Groups share of these charges amounted to 4 million net of tax.
During 2013, RAI recognised income of US$219 million related to its 2012 MSA liability as an adjusting item, the Groups share of which amounted to 33 million net of tax.
Credits in respect of the 2013 liability and future years would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, RAI recognised amounts which have been combined in the table of adjusting items and reported in other.
These consist of a charge of US$18 million in respect of a number of Engle progeny lawsuits, the Groups share of which amounted to 3 million net of tax : costs of US$34 million relating to other tobacco-related litigation charges, the Groups share of which amounted to 6 million net of tax : trademark amortisation and impairment of US$27 million, the Groups share of which amounted to 4 million net of tax : and costs of US$124 million relating to losses on extinguishment of debt, the Groups share of which amounted to 22 million net of tax.
139 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes on the Accounts continued 5 Associates and joint ventures continued b Master Settlement Agreement In 1998, the major US cigarette manufacturers including R J Reynolds and Brown & Williamson entered into the Master Settlement Agreement MSA with attorney generals representing most US states and territories.
The MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on the major US cigarette manufacturers.
The amounts of money that the participating manufacturers are required to annually contribute are based upon, amongst other things, the volume of cigarettes sold and market share based on cigarette shipments in that year.
Given these facts, the Groups accounting for the MSA payments is to accrue for them in the cost of products sold as the products are shipped and no provision is made in respect of potential payments relating to future years.
The event which gives rise to the obligation is the actual sales of products shipped and the MSA payments are therefore recognised as part of the costs of those business operations.
During 2013, RAI, various other tobacco manufacturers, 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico reached a final agreement related to RAIs 2003 Master Settlement Agreement MSA activities.
Under this agreement RAI will receive credits, currently estimated to be more than US$1 billion, in respect of its Non-Participating Manufacturer NPM Adjustment claims related to the period from 2003 to 2012.
These credits will be applied against the companys MSA payments over a period of five years from 2013, subject to, and dependent upon, meeting the various ongoing performance obligations.
During 2014, two additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2003 to 2012.
It is estimated that RAI will receive US$170 million in credits, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2014. c Other financial information 2014 2013 Groups Groups share share m m Profit on ordinary activities after taxation attributable to owners of the parent 719 739 Other comprehensive income: Differences on exchange 113 141 Net fair value gains losses on available-for-sale investments 15 7 Actuarial losses gains relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits note 20 124 90 Total comprehensive income note 11 723 681 2014 2013 Groups Groups share share m m Dividends received listed investments 510 504 unlisted investments 8 8 Total dividends received from associates 518 512 Summarised financial information of the Groups associates and joint ventures: 2014 2013 RAI ITC Others Total RAI ITC Others Total m m m m m m m m Revenue 5,132 3,777 292 9,201 5,268 3,557 309 9,134 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 1,551 1,389 57 2,997 1,648 1,358 67 3,073 Post-tax results of associates and joint ventures 1,000 938 42 1,980 1,035 942 48 2,025 Other comprehensive income 166 184 29 11 130 454 34 290 Total comprehensive income 834 1,122 13 1,969 1,165 488 82 1,735 140 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 6 Taxation on ordinary activities a Summary of taxation on ordinary activities 2014 2013 m m UK corporation tax Overseas tax 1,450 1,567 Comprising: current year tax expense 1,439 1,581 adjustments in respect of prior periods 11 14 Total current tax 1,450 1,567 Deferred tax 5 33 Comprising: deferred tax relating to origination and reversal of temporary differences 7 33 deferred tax relating to changes in tax rates 2 1,455 1,600 b Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order British American Tobacco is the principal test claimant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue and Customs in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The case concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The claim was filed in 2003 and the case was heard in the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2005 and a decision of the ECJ received in December 2006.
In July 2008, the case reverted to a trial in the UK High Court for the UK Court to determine how the principles of the ECJ decision should be applied in a UK context.
The High Court judgement in November 2008 concluded, amongst other things, that the corporation tax provisions relating to dividend income from EU subsidiaries breached EU law.
It also concluded that certain dividends received before 5 April 1999 from the EU and, in some limited circumstances after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been creditable against advance corporation tax ACT liabilities with the consequence that ACT need not have been paid.
Claims for the repayment of UK tax incurred where the dividends were from the EU were allowed back to 1973.
The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgement handed down on 23 February 2010.
The Court of Appeal determined that various questions, including which companies in the corporate tree can be included in a claim, should be referred back to the ECJ for further clarification.
In addition, the Court determined that the claim should be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back to 1973.
The issue of time limits was heard by the Supreme Court in February 2012 and in May 2012 the Supreme Court decided in  Groups favour, that claims submitted before 8 September 2003 can go back to 1973.
A hearing took place in February 2012 at the ECJ on the questions referred from the Court of Appeal.
The ECJ judgement of 13 November 2012 confirms that the UK treatment of EU dividends was discriminatory and produces the same outcome for third country dividends from 1994 in certain circumstances.
The judgement also confirms that the claim can cover dividends from all indirect as well as direct EU subsidiaries and also ACT paid by a superior holding company.
The detailed technical issues of the quantification mechanics of the claim were heard by the High Court during May and June 2014 and the judgement handed down on 18 December 2014.
The High Court determined that in respect of issues concerning the calculation of unlawfully charged corporation tax and advanced corporation tax, the law of restitution including the defence on change of position and questions concerning the calculation of overpaid interest, the approach of the British American Tobacco Group was broadly preferred.
The conclusion reached by the High Court would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of 1.2billion for British American Tobacco.
Appeals on a majority of the issues have been made to the Court of Appeal, which is likely to hear the case in 2016.
No potential receipt has been recognised in the current period or the prior year, in the results of the Group, due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome.

145 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes on the Accounts continued 9 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 9,842 million 2013: 10,249 million is included in intangible assets in the balance sheet of which the following are the significant acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,384 million 2013: 4,542 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 2,223 million 2013: 2,281 million : ETI Italy 1,280 million 2013: 1,371 million and ST principally Scandinavia 963 million 2013: 1,030 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Eastern Europe, Western Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export markets in the United Kingdom and operations in Asia-Pacific.
In 2014 and 2013, goodwill was allocated for impairment testing purposes to 14 individual cash-generating units five in Asia-Pacific, five in the Americas, two in Western Europe and two in EEMEA.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of Canada 2,223 million 2013: 2,281 million, Western Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 3,388 million 2013: 3,624 million, Eastern Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 851 million 2013: 908 million, South Africa 614 million 2013: 639 million, Australia includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 703 million 2013: 724 million, Singapore 517 million 2013: 511 million and Malaysia 432 million 2013: 434 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of all cash-generating units have been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amounts of all units are the budgeted volumes, operating margins and long-term growth rates, which directly impact the cash flows, and the discount rates used in the calculation.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These adjustments are derived from external sources and are based on the spread between bonds or credit default swaps, or similar indicators issued by the US or comparable governments and by the local government, adjusted for the Groups own credit market risk.
For ease of use and consistency in application, these results are periodically calibrated into bands based on internationally recognised credit ratings.
The long-term growth rates and discount rates have been applied to the budgeted cash flows of each cash-generating unit.
These cash flows have been determined by local management based on experience, specific market and brand trends, pricing expectations and costs, and have been endorsed by Group management as part of the consolidated Group budget.
The valuations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one-year period, with growth in year 2 of 5% 2013: 6%.
Cash flows for the years 3 to 10 are extrapolated from year 2 cash flows of each relevant operating unit at 4% 2013: 5% per annum, including 1% 2013: 2% inflation, where after a total growth rate of 2% 2013: 2% per annum including 2% 2013: 2% inflation has been assumed.
The extrapolated growth rates are considered conservative given the Groups history of profit and cash growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates.
The long-term real growth does not exceed the expected long-term average growth rate for the combined markets in which the cash-generating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, thevaluation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of the country or market management, spanning five years or beyond.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.2% and 15.0% 2013: 7.2% to 14.1% were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for economic and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 8.5% for Canada 2013: 8.5%, 8.6% for Western Europe 2013: 9.3%, 8.5% for Eastern Europe 2013: 8.6%, 9.6% for South Africa 2013: 9.3%, 8.6% for Australia 2013: 8.6%, 7.2% for Singapore 2013: 7.2% and 8.7% for Malaysia 2013: 8.7%.
If discounted cash flows for cash-generating units should fall by 10%, or the discount rate was increased at a post-tax rate of 1%, there would be no impairment.

This combination resulted in the formation of RAI, which is 58% owned by RJ Reynolds shareholders and 42% owned by the Group.
The Group has concluded that it does not have fide facto control of RAI because of the operation of the governance agreement between the Group and RAI which ensures that the Group does not have the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of RAI: in particular, the Group cannot nominate more than five of the Directors out of 13 or proportionally less if there are less than 13 Directors unless it owns 100% of RAI or some other party owns more than 50%.
In addition, there are no other contractual arrangements which would give the Group the ability to direct RAIs operations.
Manufacturing and cooperation agreements between RAI and the Group have been agreed on an arms length basis see note 29.
The Groups share of RAI includes 472 million 2013: 446 million of trademarks arising from the RAI transaction in 2004.
In addition, the Groups share of non-current assets includes 667 million 2013: 628 million of goodwill and 308 million 2013: 291 million of trademarks arising from the acquisition of Conwood by RAI in 2006.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out in note 30.
In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 30, RAI group companies are named in litigation which does not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.
The Groups share of the RAI results for the year to 31 December 2014 includes 46 million 2013: 43 million in respect of external legal fees and other external product liability defence costs.
On 15 July 2014, the Group announced that it has agreed to invest US$4.7 billion as part of RAIs proposed acquisition of Lorillard enabling the Group to maintain its 42% equity position in the enlarged business.
The investment is contingent upon the completion of RAIs acquisition of Lorillard, which has been approved by the shareholders of RAI and Lorillard, and the proposed acquisition, while subject to a number of regulatory approvals in the US, is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2015.
ITC Ltd ITC prepares accounts on a quarterly basis with a 31 March year-end.
As permitted by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, results up to 30 September 2014 have been used in applying the equity method.
This is driven by the availability of information at the half year, to be consistent with the treatment in the Groups interim accounts.
Any further information available after the date used for reporting purposes is reviewed and any material items adjusted for in the final results.

149 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes on the Accounts continued 12 Retirement benefit schemes The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate around 170 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally and many of which are closed to new entrants.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The principal schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Together schemes in these territories account for over 85% of the total obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
These obligations consist mainly of final salary pension schemes which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
As a result of regulatory changes, with effect from 1 January 2015, theschemes in the Netherlands now accrue benefits based on lifetime average salaries.
In addition, the Group operates several health care benefit schemes, of which the most significant are in Canada.
The liabilities in respect of healthcare benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method.
All of these arrangements, including funded schemes where formal trusts or equivalents are required, have been developed and are operated in accordance with local practices and regulations where applicable in the countries concerned.
For example, in the UK, the main pension scheme is the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund, which is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, PensionAct 2004 and all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for the governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the trustees.
The trustees for each arrangement will usually consist of representatives appointed by both the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries.
The majority of schemes are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes and after taking into account regulatory requirements.
Contributions to the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund have been agreed with the trustee as part of a recovery plan to include 30million a year to cover ongoing service costs and additional contributions to eliminate a funding shortfall.
Additional contributions were 140 million in 2014 and 190 million in 2013 and are planned to be 148 million in 2015, and 78 million in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018.
These contributions will be used to achieve the statutory funding objective and thereafter to support attaining a lower risk investment strategy noted below and may be subject to renegotiation, dependent on funding levels.
Total contributions payable are secured by a charge over the Groups Head Office Globe House up to a maximum of 150 million.
The charge would be triggered in the event that the Group defaults on agreed contributions due to the Fund or if an insolvency event occurs with respect to the UK entity responsible for making the payments.
The charge is due to be released in 2039 but may be released earlier by negotiation or if the assets of the Fund are sufficient to achieve certain funding levels.
Under the rules of the scheme, any future surplus would be returnable to the Group by refund at the end of the life of the scheme.
The funding commitment is therefore not considered onerous and in accordance with IFRIC 14 no additional liabilities have been recognised in respect of this commitment.
Payments made to pensioners by the operating companies in Germany, net of income on scheme assets, are deemed to be company contributions to the Contractual Trust Arrangements and are anticipated to be around 27million per annum for the next five years.
Contributions to pension schemes in Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland in total are anticipated to be around 22million per annum for the next five years.
Group contributions to pension schemes in 2015 are expected to be 243 million in total compared to 241 million in 2014.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however, there are also a number of unfunded schemes where the sponsoring company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
For unfunded schemes in the UK and Canada, 32% of the liabilities reported at year-end are expected to be settled by the Group within 10 years, 29% between 10 and 20 years, 20% between 20 and 30 years, and 19% thereafter.
The funded arrangements in the Group have policies on investment management, including strategies over a preferred long-term investment profile, and schemes in certain territories including Canada and the Netherlands manage their bond portfolios to match the weighted average duration of scheme liabilities.
In addition, the main scheme in the UK has a target investment strategy such that, by 31 December 2018, thescheme will have moved to 20% return-seeking assets and 80% risk-reducing assets.
Investments are diversified by type of investment, byinvestment sector, and where appropriate by country.
150 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 12 Retirement benefit schemes continued Through its defined benefit pension schemes and health care schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, including: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set by reference to bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield e. g. due to stock market volatility, this will create a deficit.
However, most schemes hold a proportion of assets which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, and the majority of schemes by value are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings or other hedging instruments.
Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place in the scheme rules, while some assets and derivatives provide specific inflation protection.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Assumptions regarding mortality and mortality improvements are regularly reviewed in line with actuarial tables and scheme specific experience.

In addition certain scheme assets, including a portion of the assets held in the main UK pension scheme, are further diversified by investing in equities listed on foreign stock exchanges via investment funds.
In the above analysis investments via equity-based investment funds are shown under listed equities, and investments via bond-based investment funds are shown under listed bonds.
In Jamaica, a pension scheme holds shares in Carreras Group Ltd. a Group subsidiary with a fair value of 1 million 2013: 1 million.
The shares are listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange.
Other assets include cash and other deposits, derivatives and other hedges including liability driven investments funds and inflation opportunity funds, recoverable taxes, reinsurance contracts, infrastructure investments and investment property.
The actuarial gains and losses in both years principally relate to movements in the fair values of scheme assets and actual returns are stated net of applicable taxes and fund management fees.

Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2014 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation, while asset values also change, and the impacts may offset to some extent.

No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused losses.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary differences of 971 million 2013: 1,005 million, which have no expiry date and 193 million 2013: 159 million, which will expire within the next 10 years.

No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused tax credits.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries which would be subject to dividend withholding tax was 2 billion 2013: 2 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of this withholding tax because the Group is in a position to control the timing of these distributions and it is probable that these distributions will not be made in the foreseeable future.

The principal restructuring activities in 2014 and 2013 are as described in note 3 e. While some elements of the non-current provisions of 55 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that approximately 25% will unwind in 2016 and over 82% within five years.
Employee related benefits mainly relate to long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits.
As the principal components of these provisions are long service awards and jubilee payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years.
It is estimated that approximately 46% of the non-current provisions of 27 million will unwind within five years.
A provision of 274 million was made in 2011 for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect of the clean-up of sediment in the Fox River.
On 30 September 2014, the Group, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into the Funding Agreement.
The details of this agreement are explained in note 30.
This agreement led to payments of 56 million in the year.
In addition, the Group incurred other costs of 7 million which were also charged against the provision.
In light of the conclusion of the Funding Agreement, the sums that the Group has agreed to pay thereunder, as well as the available information in relation to the extent of the clean-up related costs, the Group has reviewed the Fox River provision and 27 million has been released from the provision in 2014.
It is expected that the non-current provision will unwind within five years.
Other provisions comprise balances set up in the ordinary course of general business that cannot be classified within the other categories, such as sales returns, onerous contracts, together with amounts in respect of supplier, excise and other disputes.
The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate, and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include reversals of 18 million for restructuring of existing businesses, nil for employee benefits and 17 million for other provisions.

Deferred income relates primarily to government grants for property acquired in Brazil.
Amounts payable to related parties including associated undertakings are shown in note 29.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other payables and their fair value due to the short-term duration of the majority of trade and other payables, as determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
Trade and other payables are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings with less than 5% in other currencies 2013: less than 5%.
24 Financial instruments and risk management Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework set by the Groups Main Board and Corporate Finance Committee CFC, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
The Groups treasury position is monitored by the CFC which meets regularly throughout the year and is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
The approach is one of risk reduction within an overall framework of delivering total shareholder return.
The Group defines capital as net debt see note 21 and equity see note 20.
The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest cover as described under interest rate risk below.
The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow, net debt and interest cover.
Group policies include a set of financing principles and key performance indicators including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest coverand liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends asa percentage of long-term sustainable earnings and share buy-back are decided.
The key objective of the financing principles is to appropriately balance the interests of equity and debt holders in driving an efficient financing mix for the Group.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Groups Balance Sheet and related notes.
The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.
The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of at least five years with no more than 20% of centrally managed debt maturing in a single rolling year.
As at 31 December 2014, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 6.8 years 2013: 7.2 years and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single rolling year was 18.7% 2013: 18.3%.
It is Group policy that short-term sources of funds including drawings under both the Group US$2 billion commercial paper programme, and the Group 1 billion euro commercial paper ECP programme are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash.
The Groups commercial paper programme is mainly issued by B.
A. T. International Finance p. l. c. British American Tobacco Holdings The Netherlands B. V. and B.
A. T. Netherlands Finance B. V. At 31 December 2014, commercial paper of 160 million was outstanding 2013: 521 million.
In May 2014, the Group through B.
A. T. International Finance p. l. c. negotiated a new central banking facility of 3 billion with a final maturity of May 2019 with two additional one-year extensions at the option of the banks.
This facility is provided by 22 banks.
The new facility is on significantly improved terms compared to the previous central banking facility of 2 billion, with a maturity of December 2015, which was cancelled at the same time.
The new facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2014 2013: undrawn.

During the year, the Groups subsidiary in Brazil received proceeds of 411 million 2013: 399 million from short-term borrowings in respect of advance payments on leaf export contracts and repaid 271 million 2013: 436 million.
The Group has a US$240 million facility, maturing in 2016.
This facility is drawable in Chilean peso and was drawn to the value of US$225 million at 31 December 2014 2013: US$225 million.
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to inter-company loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group.
The key objectives of Treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect the principal value of cash and cash equivalents, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise the required long-term debt issuance, and to optimise the yield earned.
The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at 31 December 2014 the ratings from Moodys and S&P were A3 stable outlook Astable outlook 2013: A3 A-.
The Moodys rating was upgraded from Baa1 to A3 on 12 March 2013.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned the debt issuance during 2014 and 2013 and, despite the impact of the turbulence in financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets, as demonstrated with the issue of bonds in the Swiss franc, euro, US dollar and sterling markets in 2014 and 2013.
As part of its short-term cash management, the Group invests in a range of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, which are regarded as highly liquid and are not exposed to significant changes in fair value.
These are kept under continuous review as described in the credit risk section below.
At 31 December 2014, cash and cash equivalents include nil invested in money market funds 2013: 156 million.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them is expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Danish krone, Swiss franc, SouthAfrican rand, Russian rouble, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar.
These exposures are kept under continuous review.
The Groups policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost-effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
The main objective of these policies is to protect shareholder value by increasing certainty and minimising volatility in earnings per share.
At 31 December 2014, the currency profile of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 19% 2013: 21% US dollar, 40% 2013: 41% euro, 2% 2013: 2% Canadian dollar, 26% 2013: 21% sterling, and 13% 2013: 15% other currencies.
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates and joint arrangements: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions: and ii forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts which are designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.
178 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analysis.
The Group considers a 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year-end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 10% strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 2 million higher 2013: 24 million higher and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 49 million higher 2013: 15 million higher.
A 10% weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 3 million lower 2013: 31 million lower and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 59 million lower 2013: 19 million lower.
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income relate to hedging of certain net asset currency positions inthe Group as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions, but does not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on non-financial assets or liabilities.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
The Group targets an interest cover ratio, as calculated under its key central banking facilities, of greater than 5 and for 2014 it is 12.0 times 2013: 12.3 times.
The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, whichrequire a gross interest cover of 4.5.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The Group sets targets within overall guidelines for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross and net basis at least 50% fixed on a net basis in the short to the medium term as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by the Corporate Finance Committee and the Board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2014, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 45:55 2013: 43:57 on a gross basis and 30:70 2013: 25:75 on a net basis.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix.
The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group.
For the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included.
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points.
In these instances it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being 35 million lower 2013: 22 million lower.
A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, or less where applicable, would result in pre-tax profit being 20 million higher 2013: 1 million higher.
The effect of these interest rate changes on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is not material in either year.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Groups favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned.
All derivatives are subject to ISDA agreements or equivalent documentation.
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties.
Generally the Group targets a long-term counterparty credit rating of at least AA3.
However, the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, sovereign risk can be the determining factor on the suitability of a counterparty.
From time to time the Group may invest in short-dated corporate commercial paper and for this, the Group identifies specific counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of A1 P1.
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint, while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.
179 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes on the Accounts continued 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued With the following exceptions, the maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Groups Balance Sheet.
The Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The unrecognised portion of these guaranteed amounts was 28 million 2013: 30 million.
During 2014, the Group has guaranteed the borrowings of the non-controlling interest in respect of the capital injection made to the Groups Algerian business see note 26 c. In addition, the Group has entered into short-term risk participation agreements in relation to certain leaf supply arrangements and the maximum exposure under these would be 106 million 2013: 91 million.
The impact of own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not material.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.
Hedge accounting In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective.
Fair value estimation The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year, other than derivatives, are assumed to approximate their book values.
For other financial instruments which are measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, the basis for fair values is described below.
Fair value hierarchy The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in accordance with the IFRS 13 classification hierarchy: 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets at fair value Available-for-sale investments note 15 50 36 86 Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 300 300 cross-currency swaps note 16 36 36 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 225 225 Assets at fair value 50 561 36 647 Liabilities at fair value Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 102 102 cross-currency swaps note 16 23 23 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 124 124 Liabilities at fair value 249 249 180 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets at fair value Available-for-sale investments note 15 54 36 90 Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 121 121 cross-currency swaps note 16 6 6 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 298 298 Assets at fair value 54 425 36 515 Liabilities at fair value Derivatives relating to interest rate swaps note 16 63 63 cross-currency swaps note 16 41 41 forward foreign currency contracts note 16 60 60 Liabilities at fair value 164 164 Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market and fair value is based on quoted prices at the year-end.
Level 2 financial instruments are not traded in an active market, but the fair values are based on quoted market prices, broker dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments include OTC derivatives.
The fair values of level 3 financial instruments have been determined using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
The Groups level 3 financial instruments primarily consist of an equity investment in an unquoted entity which is valued using the discounted cash flows of estimated future dividends.
The valuation assumes the following: future dividends grow by 2.0% 2013: 2.0% and a 100 basis points decrease in the growth rate would result in the valuation being 6 million lower 2013: 6 million lower : and discount rate of 6.5% 2013: 6.5% and a 100 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in the valuation being 10 million higher 2013: 10 million higher.

The Group is subject to master netting arrangements in force with financial counterparties with whom the Group trades derivatives.
The master netting arrangements determine the proceedings should either party default on their obligations.
In case of any event of default: the non-defaulting party will calculate the sum of the replacement cost of outstanding transactions and amounts owed to it by the defaulting party.
If that sum exceeds the amounts owed to the defaulting party, the defaulting party will pay the balance to the non-defaulting party.
If the sum is less than the amounts owed to the defaulting party, the non-defaulting party will pay the balance to the defaulting party.

The joint venture was created in accordance with the Joint Venture Agreement signed by both companies.
It owns and manages the worldwide international cigarette trademark State Express 555, and also, the worldwide rights outside China to the leading CNTC brand, Shuang Xi.
CTBAT is reported as part of the Asia-Pacific region with the majority of its international sales non-China domestic sales made through existing end markets of the Group in that region.
All sales to mainland China are via CNTC.
CTBAT operates as an extension of the existing tobacco businesses of its investors and is therefore treated as a joint operation as defined under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
The Group recognises its share 50% of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the arrangement on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
The contribution of brands and businesses into CTBAT were recognised by the new entity at fair value, resulting in a gain on the deemed partial disposal of the State Express 555 brand, which was treated as an adjusting item see note 3 g. The impact of the arrangement on operating results for 2014 and 2013 is not material.
b British American Tobacco Myanmar Limited On 8 July 2013, the Group announced the completion of a joint venture in Myanmar with I. M. U.
Enterprise Limited to manufacture, distribute and market the Groups brands.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Group has contributed plant and machinery and cash to the venture in return for a controlling stake, and will therefore, account for the transaction as a business combination.
Goodwill of 1 million in relation to the acquisition of the 51% stake in the business reflects the strategic premium to acquire the opportunity to re-enter the Myanmar market.
The Groups proportion of the total net assets acquired at fair value amounted to 8 million with non-controlling interests of 8 million.
c Non-controlling interests BAT Algrie S. P. A.
On 8 June 2014, the Group made a capital injection to BAT Algrie S. P. A. at a cost of 4 million.
This injection was in proportion to a capital injection made by the non-controlling interest to the Group company and as such, the Groups shareholding remains unchanged.
During 2014, the Group acquired in total a further 1% interest in BAT Chile Operaciones, S. A. at a cost of 3 million.
This increased the Groups shareholding to 99%.
On 15 December 2014, the Group acquired a further 1% interest in BAT Central America S. A. at a cost of 1 million.
This increased the Groups shareholding to 79%.
d Items classified as held-for-sale At 31 December 2014, held-for-sale assets comprised mainly plant and equipment in Souza Cruz and land and buildings in Denmark which were being actively marketed for sale.
At 31 December 2013, held-for-sale assets comprised mainly land and buildings in Denmark.

Payout is subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share 50% of grant, total shareholder return 25% of grant and net turnover 25% of grant.
Total shareholder return combines the share price and dividend performance of the Company by reference to one comparator group.
Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the options.
A cash equivalent dividend accrues through the vesting period and is paid on vesting.
Both equity and cash-settled LTIPs are granted in March each year.
Prior to 2014, payout is subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share relative to inflation 50% of grant and total shareholder return, combining the share price and dividend performance of the Company by reference to two comparator groups 50% of grant.
Deferred Share Bonus Scheme DSBS Free ordinary shares released three years from date of grant and may be subject to forfeit if a participant leaves employment before the end of the three-year holding period.
Participants receive a separate payment equivalent to a proportion of the dividend payment during the holding period.
Both equity and cash-settled deferred shares are granted in March each year.
The Group also has a number of other arrangements which are not material for the Group and these are as follows: Share Option Scheme ESOS Options exercisable three years from date of grant with a contractual life of 10 years, subject to earnings per share performance condition relative to inflation.
Participants are not entitled to receive dividends in the period prior to the exercise of the options.
The granting of options under this scheme ceased with the last grant made in March 2004 and final outstanding awards were exercised by March 2014.
Sharesave Scheme SAYE Options granted in March each year from 2011 onwards previously November until 2009 and no options were granted during 2010 by invitation at a 20% discount to the market price.
Options to this equity-settled scheme are exercisable at the end of a three-year or five-year savings contract.
The maximum amount that can be saved by a participant in this way is 6,000 2013: 3,000 in any tax year.
Share Reward Scheme SRS and International Share Reward Scheme ISRS Free shares granted in April each year maximum 3,000 in any year under the equity-settled scheme are subject to a three-year holding period.
Participants receive dividends during the holding period which are reinvested to buy further shares.
Partnership Share Scheme Open to all eligible employees, where employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary to purchase shares in British American Tobacco p. l. c. The maximum amount that can be allocated in this way to any individual is 1,800 in any tax year.

Valuation assumptions Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of share options at grant date were as follows: 2014 2013 LTIP DSBS LTIP DSBS Expected volatility % 18 18 25 25 Average expected term to exercise years 3.5 3.0 3.5 3.0 Risk-free rate % 1.4 1.1 0.4 0.3 Expected dividend yield % 4.2 4.2 3.8 3.8 Share price at date of grant 32.60 32.60 35.05 35.05 Fair value at grant date 17.72 19.55 23.69 23.44 31.23 Where two figures have been quoted for the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the first number represents the awards made to employees below Management Board level and the second number to awards made to the members of the Management Board, as at the date of award.
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte-Carlo models for the total shareholder return elements of the LTIP, in determining fair value at grant date.
Assumptions used in these models were as follows: 2014 2013 % % Average share price volatility FTSE 100 comparator group 37 Average share price volatility FMCG comparator group 20 26 Average correlation FTSE 100 comparator group 37 Average correlation FMCG comparator group 31 37 187 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes on the Accounts continued 27 Share-based payments continued Fair values determined from the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models use assumptions revised at the end of each reporting period for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements.
The expected British American Tobacco p. l. c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the return index, the share price index plus the dividend reinvested over a five-year period.
The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility, and correlations were also determined over the same periods.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, forthe effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price.
In addition to these valuation assumptions, LTIP awards contain earnings per share performance conditions.
As these are non-market performance conditions they are not included in the determination of fair value of share options at the grant date, however they are used to estimate the number of awards expected to vest.
This pay-out calculation is based on expectations published in analysts forecasts.
