Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit before taxation.
With effect from 1 April 2014 the UK statutory corporation tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea.
For 2014, the items presented in the reconciliation are distorted as a result of the tax credits related to the impairment losses recognized in the year, and the effect of the impairment losses on the profit for the year.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate for 2014, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the effects of the impairment losses, and for the effects of the impairment losses in isolation.
For 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate is not affected significantly by impairment losses.
See Note 3 for further information.

For 2014, impairment charges have generated losses on which tax credits arise, mainly in Norway and the UK North Sea, with applicable statutory tax rates of 78% and 62% respectively.
For 2013 and 2012, jurisdictions which contribute significantly are Angola, the UK and Trinidad with rates as disclosed above.
b For 2013, this relates to the non-taxable gain on disposal of our investment in TNK-BP.
Legislation to reduce the UK supplementary charge tax rate applicable to profits arising in the North Sea is expected to be enacted in 2015.
The evaluation of the effect of this change for BP has not yet been completed.
