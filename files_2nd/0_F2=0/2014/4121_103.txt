The Groups financial liabilities include sterling denominated overdraft balances of nil 2013: 66,000 and euro nil 2013: 483,000, all of which are held in the UK.
The proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
The Groups other financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Credit risk The Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
Debts with other customers, which represent a smaller proportion of the Groups trade receivables, are considered to provide greater risk, particularly in the current economic climate.
These debts are reviewed on a regular basis by credit controllers and senior management and prudent provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Report & Accounts 2014 Cranswick plc 101 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 22.
Financial instruments continued All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.
The Groups forward currency contracts are measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuations are provided by the Groups bankers from the proprietary valuations models and are based on mid-market levels as at close of business on the Groups year end reporting date.
The Groups 3.3 per cent retained shareholding in the aquatics business Tropical Marine Centre 2012 Limited would have been classified as Level 3: however as the investment is an unquoted entity and cannot be reliably measured the Directors consider that its value is immaterial and no fair value has been applied.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
The fair value of floating rate assets and liabilities is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
All derivative financial instruments are shown in the balance sheet at fair value.

102 Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2014 Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Strategic Report Financial Statements Hedges Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The Group hedges the following cash flows: i Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases The Group hedges a proportion of its near-term expected purchases denominated in overseas currencies.
Where these hedges meet the hedge criteria of IAS 39 changes in fair value are posted directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified through the income statement at the time that the hedged item affects profit or loss.

The Company does not hold any forward contracts.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity.
Currency derivatives have not been included in the sensitivity analysis below as they are not considered to be exposed to interest rate risk.
