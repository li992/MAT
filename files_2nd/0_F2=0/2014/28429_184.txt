Additional information Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 313 Additional unaudited financial information I: IFRS profit and loss information a Analysis of long-term insurance business pre-tax IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns by driver This schedule classifies the Groups pre-tax operating earnings from long-term insurance operations into the underlying drivers of those profits, using the following categories: Spread income represents the difference between net investment income or premium income in the case of the UK annuities new business and amounts credited to certain policyholder accounts.
It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
With-profits business represents the gross of tax shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund for the year.
Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.
Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance as well as items that are more appropriately included in other sources of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
DAC adjustments comprises DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.
Analysis of pre-tax IFRS operating profit by source and Margin analysis of Group long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other suitable driver.
Details on the calculation of the Groups average policyholder liability balances are given in note iii.

Analysis of Asia operating profit drivers Spread income has increased by 17 per cent at constant exchange rate AER 9 per cent to 125 million in 2014, predominantly reflecting the growth of the Asia non-linked policyholder liabilities: Fee income has increased by 11 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 1 per cent from 140 million in 2013 to 155 million in 2014, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked liabilities: Insurance margin has increased by 59 million at constant exchange rates to 675 million in 2014, predominantly reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
2014 insurance margin includes non-recurring items of 27 million 2013: 52 million at AER: 48 million on CER : Excluding the adverse impact of currency fluctuations, margin on revenues has increased by 132 million from 1,413 million in 2013 to 1,545 million in 2014, primarily reflecting higher premium income recognised in the period: Acquisition costs have increased by 12 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 2 per cent to 1,031 million in 2014, compared to the 15 per cent increase in sales AER 5 per cent increase, resulting in a modest decrease in the acquisition costs ratio.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE.
If with-profits sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 66 per cent 2013: 65 per cent at CER, broadly consistent with the prior year: Administration expenses have increased by 7 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 3 per cent decrease to 618 million in 2014 as the business continues to expand.
On constant exchange rates, the administration expense ratio has reduced from 279 basis points in 2013 to 256 basis points in 2014: and Expected return on shareholder assets has increased from 52 million in 2013 to 64 million in 2014, primarily due to higher income from increased shareholder assets.

Analysis of US operating profit drivers Spread income has increased by 6 per cent at constant exchange rates AER increased by 1 per cent to 734 million during 2014.
The reported spread margin increased to 256 basis points from 246 basis points in 2013.
Spread income benefited from swap transactions previously entered into to more closely match the asset and liability duration.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 182 basis points 2013 CER: 183 basis points : Fee income has increased by 26 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 20 per cent to 1,402 million during 2014, primarily due to higher average separate account balances resulting from positive net cash flows from variable annuity business and overall market appreciation.
Fee income margin has remained broadly consistent with the prior year at 193 basis points 2013 CER: 195 basis points and AER:196 basis points, with the decrease primarily attributable to a change in the mix of business: Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Positive net flows from variable annuity business with life contingent and other guarantee fees, coupled with a benefit from repricing actions and an increased contribution from REALIC, have increased the insurance margin by 20 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 14 per cent to 670 million during 2014: Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, have decreased slightly in absolute terms and as a percentage of APE compared to 2013.
As a percentage of APE, acquisition costs have remained relatively flat in comparison to 2013: Administration expenses increased to 693 million during 2014 compared to 636 million for 2013 at a constant exchange rate AER 670 million, primarily as a result of higher asset-based commissions paid on the larger 2014 separate account balance subject to these trail commissions.
These are paid upon policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis.
Excluding these trail commissions, the resulting administration expense ratio would be lower at 36 basis points 2013: CER 44 basis points and AER 44 basis points, reflecting the benefits of operational leverage: and DAC adjustments decreased to 191 million during 2014 compared to 297 million at a constant exchange rate AER 313 million during 2013, with 2013 benefiting from a 78m AER 82 million deceleration in DAC amortisation due to strong equity market returns in that year.
This was not repeated in 2014, which experienced an accelerated DAC amortisation charge of 13 million.

Additional information Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 317 Analysis of UK operating profit drivers: Spread income has increased from 228 million in 2013 to 272 million in 2014 following an increase in bulk annuity sales that contributed 105 million 2013: 25 million in the year partially offset by lower individual annuity sales: Fee income has reduced from 65 million in 2013 to 61 million in 2014 due to a change in product mix towards those with lower asset management charges, partly offset by an increase in funds under management: Insurance margin has increased from 89 million for 2013 to 96 million for 2014, primarily due to improved profits from protection business: Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
2014 income was 176 million, 11 million lower than in 2013: Acquisition costs as a percentage of new business sales for 2014 decreased to 11 per cent from 2013 at 15 per cent, principally driven by the effect on this percentage ratio of business mix.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is therefore impacted by the level of with-profit sales in the year.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of shareholder-backed new business sales, excluding the bulk annuity transactions, were 36 per cent in 2014 2013: 35 per cent : and Administration expenses have increased from 124 million in 2013 to 143 million in 2014 largely due to increased investment spend to realign our business following the pension reforms announced in the UK Budget.
Notes i The ratio for acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE sales including with-profits sales.
Acquisition costs include only those relating to shareholder-backed business.
ii Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.
iii The 2013 comparative information has been presented at AER and CER so as to eliminate the impact of exchange translation.
CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rates.
All CER profit figures have been translated at current year average rates.
For Asia CER average liability calculations the policyholder liabilities have been translated using current year opening and closing exchange rates.
For the US CER average liability calculations the policyholder liabilities have been translated at the current year month end closing exchange rates.
iv For UK and Asia, opening and closing policyholder liabilities have been used to derive an average balance for the year, as a proxy for average balances throughout the year.
The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is derived from month end balances throughout the year as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
Average liabilities for spread income are based on the general account liabilities to which spread income attaches.
Average liabilities used to calculate the administrative expense margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
Average liabilities are adjusted for business acquisitions and disposals in the period.
v The 2014 and 2013 analyses exclude the results of the held for sale life insurance business of Japan in both the individual profit and average liability amounts shown in the table above.
vi The DAC adjustment contains 11 million in respect of joint ventures in 2014 2013: AER 1 million.
