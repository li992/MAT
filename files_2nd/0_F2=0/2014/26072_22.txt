Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 21 Share capital continued JRG was incorporated on 13 June 2013 and the allotted, called up and fully paid up share capital is detailedbelow.
As detailed in note 20, immediately prior to admission on 15 November 2013, all the A, A1, B, C1 and C2 ordinary shares, A and B preference shares including any accrued and unpaid dividend, A and B loan notes, the shareholder loan and the PPI including any accrued and unpaid interest or coupon in respect of each instrument were exchanged for new JRGHL ordinary shares.
The new JRGHL ordinary shares were exchanged for new JRG ordinary shares as follows: 215,918,221 new JRGHL ordinary shares in respect of the A, A1, B, C1 and C2 ordinary shares were exchanged for 215,918,201 new JRG ordinary shares for a value of 21.6m: 35,918,843 new JRGHL ordinary shares in respect of the A and B preference shares were exchanged for 35,918,843 new JRG ordinary shares for a value of 3.6m: 8,040,043 new JRGHL ordinary shares in respect of the A loan notes were exchanged for 8,040,043 new JRG ordinary shares for a value of 0.8m: and 106,789,311 new JRGHL ordinary shares in respect of the B loan notes, the shareholder loan and the PPI were exchanged for 106,789,311 new JRG ordinary shares for a value of 10.7m.
The comparative share capital and share premium presented in these financial statements represents that of JRGHL restated to reflect the exchange of JRGHL ordinary shares as though the reorganisation had taken place at the start of the comparative period.
The effect of this is the creation of areorganisation reserve for the difference in value of shares exchanged, asfollows: Share Share Reorganisation capital premium reserve m m m Balance at 30 June 2013 as previously presented 80.0 5.2 Restated balance at 30 June 2013 21.6 63.6 The allotted and issued ordinary share capital of Just Retirement Group plc at 30 June 2014 is detailedbelow: Share Share Number of capital premium shares m m On incorporation, ordinary shares of 0.10 20 Prior to admission: Share exchange to existing shareholders 215,918,201 21.6 Share exchange for A and B preference shareholders 35,918,843 3.6 Exchange of A loan notes 8,040,043 0.8 Exchange of the B loan notes, the shareholder loan and the PPI 106,789,311 10.7 JRG shares exchanged for JRGHL shares 366,666,398 36.7 New shares issued 133,333,582 13.3 286.7 Share issue costs 7.6 On 15 November 2013: Share-based payments 831,070 0.1 1.2 Capital reduction 279.1 As at 30 June 2014 500,831,070 50.1 1.2 On 30 April 2014 Just Retirement Group plc completed a High Court approved capital reduction.
A copy of the order confirming the capital reduction has been registered by the Registrar of Companies and as such the capital reduction became effective.
All share premium attaching to the Companys ordinary shares has consequently been cancelled.
The purpose of the capital reduction was to create distributable reserves to enable the Company to pay dividends in the future.

In return for an initial single premium, these contracts pay a regular amount usually monthly or annually and sometimes increasing at a fixed or index-linked rate until the death of the policyholder.
Some contracts have payments guaranteed for a minimum term and some have payments that continue after the death of the policyholder toadependant until the death of thatdependant.
b Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance contracts Valuation discount rates Valuation discount rate assumptions for annuities are set with regards to yields on supporting assets.
An explicit allowance for credit risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on a prudent expectation of default experience of each assetclass.
2014 2013 Valuation discount rates gross liabilities % % Individually underwritten annuities 4.13 4.20 Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions have been set by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables.
These tables have been adjusted to reflect the future mortality experience of the annuitants, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the underwriting process and the Groups assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.
The assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and the managements own industry experience.
Mortality table 2014 2013 Individually underwritten annuities males PCMA00 PCMA00 Individually underwritten annuities females PCFA00 PCFA00 The percentage of each table used varies according to medical and lifestyle conditions, premium size and gender.
In addition to the mortality improvements included in the base mortality table, the Company overlays mortality improvement projections and its own additional assessment of how the additional mortality determined at the date of underwriting will develop in thefuture.
Future expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are determined from the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future policy expense levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.2% 2013: 4.2% derived from the expected retail price index implied by inflation swap rates and an additional allowance for earningsinflation.

Effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the period Economic assumption changes Discount rates Interest rates over the period have decreased by 0.07% from 4.20% at 30 June 2013 to 4.13% at 30 June 2014.
A decrease in interest rates increases the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
Expense inflation The renewal expense inflation assumption used at 30 June 2014 was 4.2% p. a.
2013: 4.2% p. a.. Non-economic assumption changes Expense assumption The renewal expense assumption used at 30 June 2014 was 38.94 per plan.
This has increased from 37.37 per plan at 30 June 2013.
Anincrease in the renewal expense assumption increases the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
d Estimated timing of net cash outflows from insurance contract liabilities The following shows the insurance contract balances analysed by duration.
The total balances are split by duration of annuity payments inproportion to the policy cash flows estimated to arise during thatperiod.

The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions remaining constant.
In reality, such an occurrence is unlikely, due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
The impacts indicated above for insurance contracts also reflect movements in financial derivatives, which are impacted by movements in interest rates.
Related reinsurance assets are not impacted by financialderivatives.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represents the Groups view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that there is a parallel shift in interest rates at alldurations.

a Terms and conditions of investment contracts The Group writes capped drawdown products for the at-retirement market.
In return for a single premium, these contracts pay a guaranteed lump sum on survival to the end of the fixed term.
There is an option at outset to select a lower sum at maturity and regular income until the earlier of death or maturity.
Upon death of the policyholder and subject to the option selected at the outset, there may be a return of premium less income received or income payable to a dependant until the death of thatdependant.

Interest accrued on the loan notes at 10% per annum compounded including rolled up interest from the quarterly payment dates.
The Class A and Class B loan notes were unsecured and rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and without preference amongst themselves.
The loan notes were repayable on the earlier of the 10th anniversary of the issue of the notes, on a listing of the Company or sale of the Company.
Immediately prior to admission, the Class A and Class B loan notes were exchanged on a pound-for-pound basis to the Company in exchange for the allotment and issue of 8,040,043 ordinary shares in the Company for a value of 0.8m for the Class A loans and 104,667,407 ordinary shares in the Company for a value of 10.5m for the Class B loans.

c Other loans Other loans relate to loan notes and PPI.
The terms of these loan notes are the same as the Class A and B loan notes.
The PPI was issued on 27 November 2009 and has a term of 99 years.
The yield on the PPI is based on the adjusted profits of the Company.
The yield for the period to 15 November 2013 was nil% 30 June 2013: nil%.

d Derivative financial instruments and obligations for repayment of cash collateral received The derivative financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
All financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such on initialrecognition.
e Deposits received from reinsurers Deposits received from reinsurers are measured and valued in accordance with the reinsurance contract, which takes into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cashflows.
f Reinsurance finance The reinsurance finance has been established in recognition of the loan obligation to the reinsurers under the Groups reinsurance financing arrangements, the repayment of which is contingent upon the emergence of surplus under the Pillar 1 valuationrules.
26 Derivative financial instruments The Company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates, and foreign exchange risk, including interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions and foreign currency assetswaps.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivatives in the statement of financial position.
The interest rate swaps are not designated as a hedge and changes in their fair value are included in profit or loss.
Derivatives are used to manage the Groups European embedded value and regulatory capital, which is affected by a surplus of long-dated fixed interest securities when liabilities are measured on a realistic basis.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. master agreements, and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
As at 30 June 2014, the Company had pledged collateral of 54.3m 2013: 34.3m of which 25.1m were gilts 2013: 17.2m and had received cash collateral of 1.8m 2013: nil.

Under the reinsurance treaties, a percentage of the liability under reinsured policies written, determined on the Pillar 1 basis, is ceded to the reinsurers who deposit back an amount calculated to cover the credit risk that would otherwise be borne by Just RetirementLimited.
In addition to the reinsurance of the mortality risk, Just Retirement Limited receives a benefit for Pillar 1 solvency purposes, because the reinsurance premium paid to the reinsurers represents less than 100% of the value of the reinsured liabilities on the treaty basis with the resultant capital benefit utilised as solvency capital in determining the regulatory Pillar 1 solvency of Just Retirement Limited.
The resultant benefit is treated as a liability in the financial statements and its repayment is contingent upon the emergence of surplus under Pillar 1 valuation rules.
The amount of deposits received from reinsurers that is expected to be settled more than one year after the statement of financial position date is 3,207.2m 2013: 3,069.8m.
During the period the Group fully repaid the financing provided in respect of the Groups underwriting year 2006 07 and exercised its right under the reinsurance contract to recapture the previously ceded insurance liabilities.
As a consequence the reinsurers also reduced the level of deposit back granted to Just Retirement Limited.
This business was recaptured at the end of December 2013, resulting in a decrease in ceded insurance liabilities of 263.1m 2013: 115.4m and a reduction in the deposit back of 263.1m 2013: 116.8m.
The consequences of this recapture are that the Group now solely bears the risks and rewards of the 2006 07 underwriting year.

34 Financial and insurance risk management This note presents information about the major financial and insurance risks to which the Group is exposed, and its objectives, policies and processes for their measurement and management.
Financial risk comprises exposure to market, credit and liquidityrisk.
a Insurance risk The writing of long-term insurance contracts requires a range of assumptions to be made and risk arises from these assumptions being materiallyinaccurate.
The Groups main insurance risk arises from adverse experience compared with the assumptions used in pricing products and valuing insurance liabilities, and in addition its reinsurance treaties may be terminated, not renewed, or renewed on terms less favourable than those under existingtreaties.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to longevity, mortality and morbidity and exposure to factors such as withdrawal levels and management and administration expenses.
Individually underwritten annuities are priced using assumptions about future longevity that are based on historic experience information, lifestyle and medical factors relevant to individual customers, and judgements about the future development of longevity improvements.
In the event of an increase in longevity, the actuarial reserve required to make future payments to customers may increase.
Loans secured by mortgages are used to match some of the liabilities arising from the sale of annuities.
In the event that early repayments in a given period are higher than anticipated, less interest will have accrued on the mortgages and the amount repayable will be less than assumed at the time of sale.
In the event of an increase in longevity, although more interest will have accrued and the amount repayable will be greater than assumed at the time of the sale, the associated cash flows will be received later than had originally been anticipated.
In addition, a general increase in longevity would have the effect of increasing the total amount repayable, which would increase the LTV ratio and could increase the risk of failing to be repaid in full as a consequence of the no-negative equity guarantee.
There is also morbidity risk exposure as the contract ends whenthe customer moves into long-term care.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 107 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 34 Financial and insurance risk management continued a Insurance risk continued Underpinning the management of insurance risk are: TM The development and use of medical information PrognoSys for both pricing and reserving to provide detailed insight into longevity risk: Adherence to approved underwriting requirements: Controls around the development of suitable products and their pricing: Review and approval of assumptions used by the Actuarial Function Holder and the Board: Regular monitoring and analysis of actual experience: Use of reinsurance to minimise volatility of capital requirement and profit: and Monitoring of expense levels.
Concentrations of insurance risk Concentration of insurance risk comes from improving longevity.
Improved longevity arises from enhanced medical treatment and improved life circumstances.
Concentration risk is managed by writing business across a wide range of different medical and lifestyle conditions to avoid excessive exposure.
b Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss or of adverse change in the financial situation resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level and in the volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and financial instruments, together with the impact of changes in interest rates.
Significant market risk is implicit in the insurance business and arises from exposure to interest rate risk, property risk, inflation risk and currency risk.
The Group is not exposed to any equity risk or material currency risk.
Market risk represents both upside and downside impacts but the Groups policy to manage market risk is to limit downside risk.
Falls in the financial markets can reduce the value of pension funds available to purchase annuities, and changes in interest rates can affect the relative attractiveness of annuity products.
Changes in the value of the Groups investment portfolio will also affect the Groups financial position.
In mitigation, annuity monies are invested to match the asset and liability cash flows as closely as practicable.
In practice it is not possible to eliminate market risk fully as there are inherent uncertainties surrounding many of the assumptions underlying the projected asset and liability cash flows.
For each of the material components of market risk, described in more detail below, the market risk policy sets out the risk appetite and management processes governing how each risk should be measured, managed, monitored and reported.
i Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its impact on the value of, or income from, specific assets, liabilities or both.
It seeks to limit itsexposure through appropriate asset and liability matching and hedging strategies.
The Groups exposure to changes in interest rates is concentrated in the investment portfolio, loans secured by mortgages and its insurance obligations.
Changes in investment and loan values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the value of insurance liabilities.
The Group monitors this exposure through regular reviews of the asset and liability position, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and scenario analyses.
Interest rate risk is also managed using derivative instruments e. g. swaps and swaptions.
The following table indicates the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates for the Groups significant financial assets: Less than One to Five to Over ten No fixed one year five years ten years years term Total 30 June 2014 m m m m m m Debt securities and other fixed income securities 224.0 1,290.4 1,372.9 1,440.6 4,327.9 Units in liquidity funds 341.2 341.2 Loans secured by mortgages 2,749.4 2,749.4 Financial derivatives 30.2 12.1 42.3 Deposits with credit institutions 29.2 29.2 Total 594.4 1,290.4 1,403.1 1,452.7 2,749.4 7,490.0 108 Just Retirement Group plc Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials 34 Financial and insurance risk management continued b Market risk continued Less than One to Five to Over ten No fixed one year five years ten years years term Total 30 June 2013 m m m m m m Debt securities and other fixed income securities 235.9 1,042.6 1,120.4 1,361.0 3,759.9 Units in liquidity funds 149.3 149.3 Loans secured by mortgages 2,081.2 2,081.2 Financial derivatives 1.9 25.3 9.9 37.1 Deposits with credit institutions 17.2 17.2 Total 402.4 1,044.5 1,145.7 1,370.9 2,081.2 6,044.7 ii Property risk The Groups exposure to property risk arises from indirect exposure to the UK residential property market through the provision of lifetime mortgages.
A substantial decline or sustained underperformance in UK residential property prices, against which the Groups lifetime mortgages are secured, could result in proceeds on sale being exceeded by the mortgage debt at the date of redemption.
Demand may also reduce for lifetime mortgage products through reducing consumers propensity to borrow and by reducing the amount they are able to borrow due to reductions in property values and the impact on loan-to-value limits.
The risk is mitigated by ensuring that the advance represents a low proportion of the propertys value at outset and independent thirdparty valuations are undertaken on each property before initial mortgages are advanced.
Lifetime mortgage contracts are also monitored through dilapidation reviews.
House prices are monitored and the impact of exposure to adverse house prices both regionally and nationally isregularlyreviewed.
iii Inflation risk Inflation risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets or liabilities or both in combination, arising from relative orabsolute changes in inflation or in the volatility of inflation.
Exposure to inflation occurs in relation to the Groups own management expenses and its matching of index-linked annuities.
Its impact is managed through the application of disciplined cost control over its management expenses and through matching its index-linked assets and index-linked liabilities for the inflation risk associated with its index-linked annuities.
iv Currency risk Currency risk arises from fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies, from relative or absolute changes in foreign exchange rates or in the volatility of exchange rates.
Exposure to currency risk could arise from the Groups investment in non-sterling denominated assets.
From time to time, the Group acquires fixed income securities denominated in US dollars or other foreign currencies for its financial asset portfolio.
All Group liabilities are in sterling.
Asthe Group does not wish to introduce foreign exchange risk into its investment portfolio, derivative or quasi-derivative contracts are entered into to eliminate the foreign exchange exposure as far as possible.
c Credit risk Credit risk arises if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
Credit risk exposures arise from: Holding fixed income investments where the main risks are default and market risk.
The risk of default where the counterparty fails to pay back the capital and or interest on a corporate bond is mitigated by investing only in higher quality or investment grade assets.
Market risk is the risk of bond prices falling as a result of concerns over the counterparty, or over the market or economy in which the issuing company operates.
This leads to wider spreads the difference between redemption yields and a risk-free return, the impact of which is mitigated through the use of a hold to maturity strategy.
Concentration of credit risk exposures is managed by placing limits on exposures to individual counterparties and limits on exposures to credit rating levels: The Group also manages credit risk on its corporate bond portfolio through the appointment of specialist fund managers, who execute a diversified investment strategy, investing in investment-grade assets and imposing individual counterparty limits.
Current economic and market conditions are closely monitored, as are spreads on the bond portfolio in comparison with benchmark data: Counterparties in derivative contracts the Group uses financial instruments to mitigate interest rate and currency risk exposures.
It therefore has credit exposure to various counterparties through which it transacts these instruments, although this is usually mitigated by collateral arrangements see note 26 : Reassurance reassurance is used to manage longevity risk but, as a consequence, credit risk exposure arises should a reassurer fail to meet its claim repayment obligations.
Credit risk on reinsurance balances is mitigated by the reinsurer depositing back more than 100% of premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement: Cash balances credit risk on cash assets is managed by imposing restrictions over the credit ratings of third parties with whom cash isdeposited: and Credit risk credit risks for loans secured by mortgages has been considered within property risk above.

The carrying amount of those assets subject to credit risk represents the maximum credit riskexposure.
d Liquidity risk The investment of annuity cash in corporate bonds, gilts and lifetime mortgages, and commitments to pay policyholders and other obligations, requires liquidity risks to be taken.
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss because the Group, although solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to it in order tomeet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
Exposure to liquidity risk arisesfrom: Deterioration in the external environment caused by economic shocks, regulatory changes or reputational damage: Realising assets to meet liabilities during stressed market conditions: Increasing cash flow volatility in the short term giving rise to mismatches between cash flows from assets and requirements from liabilities: Needing to support liquidity requirements for day-to-day operations: Ensuring financial support can be provided across the Group: and Maintaining and servicing collateral requirements arising from the changes in market value of financial derivatives used by the Group.
Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups short-term liquidity requirements are wholly funded by advance annuity premium payments and investment coupon receipts out of which contractual payments need to be made.
There are significant barriers for policyholders to withdraw funds that have already been paid to the Group in the form of premiums.
Cash outflows associated with annuity liabilities can be reasonably estimated and liquidity can be arranged tomeet this expected outflow through asset-liability matching and new businesspremiums.
The cash flow characteristics of the lifetime mortgages are reversed when compared with annuities, with cash flows effectively representing anadvance payment, which is eventually funded by repayment of principal plus accrued interest.
Policyholders are able to redeem mortgages, albeit at a cost.
The mortgage assets are considered illiquid, as they are not readily saleable due to the uncertainty about their value and the lackof a market in which to tradethem.
Cash flow forecasts over the short, medium and long terms are regularly prepared to predict and monitor liquidity levels in line with limits set onthe minimum amount of liquid assets required.

These regulatory requirements apply to individual regulated subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis and in respect of the Group as a whole, and apply to different levels within the Group and on different bases.
The amount of regulatory and economic capital required also depends on the level of risk facing the insurance and other subsidiaries in the Group, and as such correlates to economic market cycles.
The Group must assess its capital resources on both a Pillar 1 regulatory capital and a Pillar 2 individual capital assessment basis and must hold sufficient qualifying regulatory capital to satisfy both tests.
Pillar 1 capital requirement is calculated by applying fixed percentages to reserves in accordance with the PRA General Prudential Sourcebook, whereas the Pillar 2 capital requirement is determined following an individual capital assessment by the Group, which is then reviewed by the PRA.
The Group may also be required by the Regulator to hold capital over and above that required to satisfy the Pillar 1 and 2 requirements and its Group riskprofile.
The Groups capital position can be adversely affected by a number of factors, in particular factors that erode the Groups capital resources and or which impact the quantum of risk to which the Group is exposed.
In addition, any event which erodes current profitability and is expected to reduce future profitability and or make profitability more volatile could impact the Groups capital position, which in turn could have a negative effect on the Groups results of operations.
The Groups objectives when managing capital for all subsidiariesare: To comply with the insurance capital requirements required by the regulators of the insurance markets where the Group operates.
TheGroups policy is to manage its capital in line with its risk appetite and in accordance with regulatory requirements: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits forother stakeholders: and To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing insurance and investment contracts commensurately with the level of risk.
