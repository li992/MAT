As Gibson Shipbrokers was previously reported as a separate segment within continuing operations, its results and cash flows for 2013 have been re-presented as a discontinued operation.
The assets and liabilities of Gibson Shipbrokers at 31 December 2014 have been treated as held for sale.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 43.

Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 94 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in the use of accounting estimates.
These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will consequently be necessary.
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of future events.
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets and liabilities: Asset liability Nature of estimates Goodwill The Group comprises a number of cash generating units CGUs with each one having independent business profiles and cash flows.
When goodwill is initially recognised upon a business combination, it is allocated to the CGUs that are expected Carrying value at to benefit from the combination.
31 December 2014 The goodwill of each CGU is subsequently reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing its carrying value with $440.6m 2013 $495.2m the present value of the estimated future gross cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU.
The estimated future gross cash flows are based on the Directors view of their future trading prospects and are discounted at a rate that is determined for each CGU in isolation by consideration of their business risk profiles.
Any shortfall in the present value of the cash flows is charged to the income statement immediately.
Details of goodwill are disclosed in note 16.
Taxation In determining current tax estimates, management has to consider the likelihood of tax authority challenges and estimates tax payable accordingly.
Carrying value of The deferred tax balances at 31 December 2014 represent an estimate of the amounts that are expected to be paid or net tax liability at recovered from the tax authorities in future periods if assets and liabilities in the balance sheet were recovered at their 31 December 2014 carrying values based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement $55.2m 2013 $48.7m of deferred tax balances therefore requires management to assess the substantively enacted tax laws and rates, the timing of the reversal of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences and the nature, timing and amount of taxable income which would potentially be available to support the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Property, plant and The Groups property, plant and equipment and intangible assets except goodwill are depreciated amortised at rates that equipment and other are intended to spread the irrecoverable cost of the assets over their useful lives.
The Directors must therefore estimate the intangible assets useful lives of the assets, their residual values and the pattern of consumption of their carrying values.
Each asset is also regularly reviewed to ensure it remains consistent with the Directors assumptions and, when required, adjustments are Combined carrying value made prospectively.
at 31 December 2014 The depreciation rates currently in use are disclosed in note 43.
Further details of the Groups property, plant and equipment $697.8m 2013 $694.8m and the other intangible assets are disclosed in notes 15 and 17 respectively.
Oil and gas exploration The carrying value of the Groups oil and gas exploration and development assets is subject to the value in use of the and development assets Groups oil and gas reserves.
The value in use is determined by applying a present value to the estimated future producible reserves at a given forecast Carrying value at market price.
31 December 2014 The estimate of producible reserves is principally extracted using a combination of geological data and production $12.5m 2013 $21.5m performance records.
The estimate of market prices is based on the medium term futures prices 4 to 6 years issued by NYMEX.
The discount rate is based on the activitys cost of capital and specific risk premium, which is estimated to be 13% pre-tax.
Details of the Groups oil and gas exploration and development expenditure are disclosed in note 15.
Provisions The provisions at 31 December 2014 are principally in respect of onerous property leases for which the Directors have estimated the period of time each property is expected to remain onerous, the cash flows expected to arise during that Carrying value at period and the risk-free discount rate required to measure the present value of the cash flows.
31 December 2014 Details of the Groups provisions are disclosed in note 27.
Segmental Reporting Group The Group reports on seven operating segments, three of which are discontinued operations, in its internal management reports, which are used to make strategic decisions.
The Groups continuing segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies and undertake exploration and production activities.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced on an arms length basis.
Continuing operations The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out and precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 95 3.
Segmental Reporting continued The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
The Board of Hunting will not be making any new capital investment, beyond where the division has contractual commitments and so the division will in future focus on producing out its remaining reserves, with a view to winding down the operation.
Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the continuing operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.
Discontinued operations Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London.
The business has been presented as a discontinued operation and its results have been restated to exclude central overheads previously allocated to the division.
The discontinued operations comprise Gibson Shipbrokers, as noted above, which has been classified as held for sale at 31 December 2014, Field Aviation, which was sold in 2012, and Gibson Energy, which was sold in 2008.
Gibson Energy and Field Aviation continue to generate accounting entries due to sale related transactions and are required for reconciliation purposes.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

Field Aviation On 27 April 2012, the Group sold its aviation engineering services business, Hunting Canadian Airport Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries, including Field Aviation Company Inc. together referred to as Field Aviation.
Under the terms of the sale, Hunting PLC and the purchaser established an environmental escrow account to address ongoing site condition costs relating to Field Aviations hangar facilities in Calgary.
Additionally, part of the consideration was deferred in the form of an interest-bearing promissory note issued to Hunting PLC, repayable by the purchaser on or before 31 December 2018.
On 30 September 2014, the promissory note was repaid in full and the environmental escrow account was wound up, with remaining funds distributed between Hunting PLC and the purchaser.
This resulted in a gain of $0.9m included within discontinued items.
Gibson Energy The sale of Gibson Energy Inc. Huntings Canadian midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008.
Subsequent gains reported relate to the settlement of tax items.

Earnings per Share Group Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.

Goodwill continued Impairment Tests for Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs as follows: 2014 2013 $m $m Titan 288.4 288.4 Hunting Stafford Subsea formally National Coupling Company 32.7 32.7 Electronics 28.7 68.7 Dearborn 25.5 25.5 Welltonic 18.0 19.1 Drilling Tools 4.4 15.5 Other 42.9 45.3 At 31 December 440.6 495.2 The recoverable amount of a CGU has been determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are revenue growth rates, taking into account the impact these have on margins, and the pre-tax discount rates applied.
As required by IFRS for value in use calculations, projections do not take into account benefits of growth projects or potential restructuring actions.
The value in use calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on the most recent financial projections and include an assessment of how the CGUs are expected to perform given current market conditions, using past experience as a guide, and monitoring the position of order books for businesses where this is appropriate.
Market conditions are currently volatile and will impact CGUs differently.
In broad terms, management has assumed a significant decline in activity for most CGUs in 2015, although in the Well Intervention segment including Hunting Stafford Subsea and Welltonic CGUs the impact is expected to be less adverse.
In 2016 a partial recovery is anticipated but with many of the CGUs remaining below 2014 levels.
Cash flows in the three to five year period are derived using estimated nominal revenue annualised growth rates between 7% and 14% 2013 5% and 7% which are higher than previously assumed, reflecting a recovery period after the short-term decline in activity.
These growth rates are inherently based on managements judgement.
This judgement is supported by external research such as Spears and Associates Drilling and Production Outlook, to assess likely changes for the countries and markets in which the relevant CGUs operate, for example, rig counts, the expected profile and footage of drilling and expected E&P spend.
Management then consider the applicability of these expectations to the CGUs business activities.
Terminal growth rates between 2% and 5% 2013 3% and 4% are then used.
Cash flows are discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 9% and 15% 2013 9% and 15%.
The discount rate best reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
Titan The Titan CGU represents 65% 2013 58% of the goodwill balance.
The carrying value, including amounts recognised on consolidation such as goodwill, is $654.0m 2013 - $676.5m.
The value in use has been calculated as for other CGUs using the methodology described above.
Cash flows have been discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 11% 2013 11%.
If minimal revenue growth is assumed over the next five years and with terminal growth rates of 2.7%, a headroom over the carrying value of the CGU in excess of 25% is generated.
Impairment of goodwill The Electronics CGU has been impacted by a prolonged period of customer fide-stocking.
This situation is being exacerbated by increased competition, in particular from the Far East, and this in combination with the expected decline in activity due to market conditions has led to the recognition of a $40.0m impairment charge to goodwill.
The CGU has a total carrying value of $63.7m based on its value in use.
The cash flows have been discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 11%.
Any further adverse changes in assumptions would give rise to further impairments to goodwill.
During 2014 there has been a downturn in activity for the Drilling Tools CGU which operates across the USA and Canada.
The business has been adversely impacted by increased competition and rising equipment maintenance costs.
The expected downturn caused by the oil price decline will particularly impact this CGU due to its focus on US shale activity and on high cost Canadian projects.
An impairment of $9.6m has been charged to goodwill.
The CGU has a total carrying value of $107.1m based on its value in use.
Sensitivities Having performed sensitivity analysis on the value in use calculations, management believes that no reasonably foreseeable change in any key assumption would cause the recoverable amount of any CGU to be materially below its carrying value.
In particular, for the Titan, Hunting Stafford Subsea, Dearborn and Welltonic CGUs, if discounted cash flows fell by 20% or the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 2% there would be no impairment.

Trade and Other Receivables continued Group Trade receivables that are not overdue and not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default or any indications that the customers will not meet their payment obligations.
At the year end there are no trade receivables 2013 none whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past due or impaired.
At 31 December 2014, trade receivables of $112.0m 2013 $94.3m were overdue but not impaired.
The ageing of these receivables at the year end is as follows: 2014 2013 Number of days overdue: $m $m 1-30 days 54.3 53.7 31-60 days 24.8 23.7 61-90 days 23.1 9.9 91-120 days 6.9 7.0 More than 120 days 2.9 Receivables overdue not impaired 112.0 94.3 Receivables not overdue and not impaired 141.1 129.4 Receivables not overdue and impaired 1.8 Receivables overdue and impaired 2.5 2.1 Provision for impairment of receivables 2.5 3.9 Net trade receivables 253.1 223.7 Receivables that are overdue but not impaired relate to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
Receivables which have been impaired mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have been raised about the customers liquidity.
Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
During the year, a provision of $1.3m 2013 $1.5m for the impairment of receivables was recognised, $0.7m 2013 $0.4m receivables were written off, $0.7m 2013 $1.0m unused provisions were released and $1.3m was classified as held for sale.
After recognising foreign exchange movements of $nil 2013 $0.1m, the provision for the impairment of trade receivables at the year end was $2.5m 2013 $3.9m.
The other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups wide and unrelated customer base.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The carrying value of each class of receivable approximates their fair value as described in note 29.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previously held.
Company None 2013 none of the Companys other receivables were past due at the year end and the Company does not consider it necessary to provide for any impairments.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable.

Derivatives and Hedging Group a Currency Derivatives The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year.
At 31 December 2014, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is $4.0m 2013 $22.5m.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a $0.1m gain 2013 $0.3m loss have been recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
The Groups forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges matured during 2014.
Losses of $0.1m 2013 $1.8m gains were recognised in the hedging reserve note 34 during the year.
Gains of $1.7m 2013 $0.2m were reclassified from equity during the year and included in revenue in the income statement.

At 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of net Canadian dollar borrowings was $33.9m and the carrying amount of net Sterling borrowings was $47.6m.
During 2014, foreign exchange gains of $5.2m on translation of the borrowings into US dollars was recognised in the cumulative translation reserve.
There were no amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations during 2013.
Financial Instruments: Fair Values Group The carrying value of investments, non-current trade and other receivables, net trade receivables, accrued revenue, other receivables, deposits maturing after three months, cash and cash equivalents, assets classified as held for sale, trade payables, accruals, other payables, provisions, liabilities classified as held for sale, bank overdrafts, unsecured bank loans and other unsecured loans approximates their fair value.
Drawdowns under the multi-currency loan facility are for periods of one month or less, and as a result, the carrying value and the fair value are considered to be the same.
The following tables present the Groups other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the year end and show the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements are categorised.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by comparing the cash flows generated by the contract with the coterminus cash flows potentially available in the forward exchange market on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of listed equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices, which is considered to be the most representative of fair value, in an active market at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of non-US dollar denominated financial instruments are translated into US dollars using the year end exchange rate.
In 2013, the fair values of the environmental escrow and the promissory note included in non-current investments were determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
The unlisted equity investments were carried at cost and the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement was estimated by applying the income approach and appropriate discount rates.
The inputs used to determine the fair value of unlisted equity investments, the environmental escrow and the contingent consideration arrangements were not based on observable market data and therefore their fair value measurements were categorised in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and so the fair value measurement can be categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of listed equity investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement can be categorised in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Company The carrying value of receivables, cash and cash equivalents, accruals, other payables, provisions, borrowings and bank overdrafts approximates their fair value.

During 2014, an amount of $1.3m was received 2013 $nil from the environmental escrow account which was subsequently closed.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash flow interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating companies.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 122 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30.
Financial Risk Management continued a Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of Sterling and Canadian dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: Sterling Canadian dollar 2014 2013 2014 2013 Average exchange rate to US dollars 0.61 0.64 1.10 1.03 Year end exchange rate to US dollars 0.64 0.60 1.16 1.06 i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than $400,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed $400,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are periodically used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax if the Group considers there to be a significant exposure.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the hedged assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from Sterling and Canadian dollar denominated net investments.
b Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and uses interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
At the year end, cash and cash equivalents totalled $88.5m 2013 $167.4m and current investments $3.8m 2013 $2.0m.
90% of cash and cash equivalents was deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
Of the remaining 10%, the vast majority was held on deposit with a mainland Chinese financial institution which, given the Groups operations in this jurisdiction, were deemed necessary.
Despite not having a formal credit rating, an internal vetting procedure determined that the banks credit profile was appropriate for this level of deposit.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 124 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30.
Financial Risk Management continued The Company operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net assets of $30.9m 2013 $29.6m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been effected by using two insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
The Company also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised by the Company as non-current investments.
Investments at the year end amounted to $8.9m 2013 $8.0m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly cash forecasts to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total $649.8m 2013 $688.8m at the year end.
The facilities comprise $584.7m 2013 $621.1m of committed facilities and $65.1m 2013 $67.7m of unsecured uncommitted facilities.
The committed facilities comprise the Sterling denominated 375.0m $584.7m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks 2013 375.0m: $621.1m.
This facility expires on 5 August 2016 and is unsecured.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Groups treasury function maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2014.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
i Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.25% 2013 0.25% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
Group The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2013 0.25% in US interest rates, is to reduce profits by $0.2m 2013 $0.5m.
If US interest rates were to decrease by 0.25% 2013 0.25%, then the post-tax impact on the income statement would be to increase profits by $0.2m 2013 $0.5m.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated borrowings.
There is no impact on other comprehensive income OCI for a change in interest rates.
Company The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2013 0.25% in the UK interest rate, is $nil 2013 a profit reduction of $0.1m.
If the UK interest rate were to decrease by 0.25% 2013 0.25%, then the post-tax impact would be $nil 2013 a profit increase of $0.1m.
The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2013 0.25% in US interest rates, is to increase profits by $0.4m 2013 $nil.
If the US interest rates were to decrease by 0.25% 2013 $nil, then the post-tax impact would be to reduce profits by $0.4m 2013 $nil.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated intra-group loans.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in interest rates.
ii Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 10% 2013 10% for Sterling and Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.

Post-Employment Benefits Group Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns.
The defined benefit section is closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The UK scheme is registered with HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from the Group and managed by a Board of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for the payment of benefits and the management of the schemes assets.
The UK scheme is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contributions schedule for the defined benefit section of the UK scheme.
Contributions to the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and other Group defined contribution arrangements are payable in addition and are charged directly to profit and loss.
Risk Exposures and Investment Strategy The weighted average duration to payment of the projected future cash flows from the defined benefit section of the UK scheme is about 17 years.
The scheme is managed so that it is well funded and represents a low risk to the Group.
In particular, the schemes assets are invested in a range of deferred annuity and immediate annuity policies with two insurers, which largely match the benefits to be paid to members of the scheme.
This strategy significantly reduces the Groups investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to the schemes liabilities.
This is demonstrated by the relative stability of the Groups pension asset from year-to-year.
The position would change materially if one of the insurers were no longer able to meet its obligations as the pension obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 128 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32.
Post-Employment Benefits continued Funding Strategy The trustees and the Group together agree a funding strategy for the scheme every three years.
Under this agreement, the Group expects to contribute approximately $4.8m to the defined benefit section of the UK scheme in the next reporting period.
The net assets for the UK post-employment benefit scheme are: 2014 2013 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 438.3 428.2 Fair value of plan assets 469.2 457.8 Net asset 30.9 29.6 Changes in the net asset recognised in the balance sheet 2014 2013 $m $m Opening balance sheet net asset 29.6 22.8 Exchange adjustments 1.8 0.8 Expense charged to income statement 4.3 4.1 Amount recognised in other comprehensive income 2.1 4.2 Employer contributions paid 5.3 5.9 Closing balance sheet net asset 30.9 29.6 The Group has concluded that it can recognise the full amount of this surplus on the grounds that it could gain sufficient economic benefit from a future reduction of its contributions to the scheme.

Post-Employment Benefits continued The Actual returns over interest on plan assets shown in the table above principally includes the impact that the changes in financial assumptions have had on the value of the insurance annuity policies.
The gain due to these factors offsets the corresponding loss on the remeasurement of the defined benefit obligation, demonstrating that the pensions-related risks have been mitigated by the schemes investment strategy.
In particular, the gain on the assets is greater than the loss on the defined benefit obligation because the value of the insurance annuity policies exceeds the value of the defined benefit obligation.
The major asset categories for the defined benefit section of the UK scheme are: 2014 2013 $m $m Insurance annuity policies 459.8 452.7 Multi-asset fund 7.8 Cash other 1.6 5.1 Fair value of plan assets 469.2 457.8 The scheme does not invest in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the UK scheme are: 2014 2013 $m $m Current service cost recognised within operating expenses 5.8 5.2 Net interest on the defined benefit asset recognised within interest income 1.5 1.1 Total expense included within staff costs note 10 4.3 4.1 The current service cost includes $1.5m 2013 $1.3m of administration costs.
In addition, employer contributions of $10.8m 2013 $9.4m for various Group defined contribution arrangements including the defined contribution section of the UK scheme are recognised in the income statement.
Special Events There were no special events during 2014.
During 2013, a tranche of benefits was secured with one of the insurers.
The effect of this was recognised in other comprehensive income.
The principal assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are: 2014 2013 Discount rate 3.6% p. a 4.4% p. a Future pension increase 3.2% p. a 3.6% p. a Future salary increase 5.2% p. a 5.6% p. a Mortality assumption life expectancy 2014 2013 Years Years Male aged 65 at the accounting date 24.9 24.8 Female aged 65 at the accounting date 27.1 27.0 Male aged 65 in 20 years 27.6 27.4 Female aged 65 in 20 years 29.5 29.4 The assumptions used to determine the end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following years cost.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 130 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32.
Post-Employment Benefits continued Sensitivity Analysis Apart from the assumption for salary increases, the change in the obligation arising as a result of changes in the above assumptions is broadly matched by a corresponding change in the value of the insurance policies, so that the impact on the net balance sheet asset is significantly dampened.
A 0.25% p. a. increase in the salary increase assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by about $2.7m 2013 $1.7m without having any impact on the value of the schemes assets.
Unfunded Defined Benefit Pension Scheme The Group also operates a cash balance arrangement in the US for certain executives.
Members build up benefits in this arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns.
Actual contributions are paid into an entirely separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when the member retires.
Under IAS 19, the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme.
The amounts recognised in the income statement during the year were $0.2m 2013 $0.2m for the employers current service cost recognised in operating expenses and $0.3m 2013 $0.1m interest cost recognised in interest expense.

Time based awards The Company grants time based share awards under the HPSP.
Annual awards of shares may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.
On 1 May 2014 the first time based awards were granted.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise during 2014 was 649.0p.
Fair value of HPSP awards The fair value of awards granted under the HPSP are calculated using two separate models: 1 The fair value of awards subject to a market related performance condition, specifically Company performance against the TSR of a bespoke peer group, has been calculated using the Stochastic pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2014 Date of grant valuation date 1 May 2014 Weighted average share price at grant 839.5p Exercise price nil Expected dividend yield nil Expected volatility 32.3% Risk free rate 1.08% Expected life 3 years Fair value 463.9p Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 137 37.
Share-based Payments continued 2 The fair value of performance based awards not subject to a market related performance condition, specifically Company performance against EPS and ROCE targets, and the time based HPSP awards has been calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2014 Date of grant valuation date 1 May 2014 Weighted average share price at grant 839.5p Exercise price nil Expected dividend yield nil Expected volatility 32.3% Risk free rate 1.08% Expected life 3 years Fair value 839.5p The methods to calculate the assumptions for both models are: The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility, equal in length to the remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance conditions.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the performance based HPSP awards granted under the HPSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge for 2014 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The 2014 charge to the income statement attributable to the performance based HPSP awards is $1.4m 2013 $nil and to the time based HPSP awards is $2.0m 2013 $nil.

Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below: 1 Consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently, the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
2 Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
3 Revenue Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods or services in the ordinary course of business, taking into account trade discounts and volume rebates, and is stated net of sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
Products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies, including tubulars acquired by Hunting as plain-end pipe on which lathing work has been applied and which is resold as threaded pipe.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the services are rendered.
The Groups service activities principally comprise lathing work on customer-owned plain-end pipe in order to apply a thread to each pipe end and commissions earned from shipbroking.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
4 Amortisation and Exceptional Items Exceptional items are items of income or expense which the Directors believe should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size or nature to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
The Group discloses such items in the middle column of the income statement.
In applying this policy, the following items have been treated as exceptional: The unwinding of fair value uplifts to inventories that were initially capitalised upon a business acquisition.
The unwind is dealt with as an exceptional item to ensure that post acquisition gross profit is based on the cost of production or purchase of inventory and is therefore consistent with and comparable to normal trading transactions in existing companies.
Impairments of property, plant and equipment held by the Exploration and Production division.
As the valuations are subject to the frequent changes in long-term oil and gas prices, such impairments can lead to volatility in the income statement that is unrelated to the underlying performance of the business.
For this reason, dry hole costs are also treated as exceptional.
Goodwill impairment charges have been recognised reflecting a combination of factors including a prolonged period of customer fide-stocking, increased competition and the expected decline in activity due to market conditions.
Foreign exchange losses relating to cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve which have been transferred to the income statement in relation to central non-operating companies which have entered into voluntary liquidation.
The release of excess property provisions no longer required following the signing of a lease termination agreement.
Litigation settlements and associated legal costs.
The tax effect of any transaction considered to be exceptional is also treated as exceptional.
Amortisation expenses for acquired intangible assets are also shown in the middle column due to the significance of these amounts and to clearly identify the effect on profits, which will arise as current balances become fully written-off, or as new acquisitions give rise to new expenses.
5 Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
6 Foreign Currencies a Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Accounts The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denoted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denoted in non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 142 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 43.
Principal Accounting Policies continued b Group Consolidated Accounts The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars.
The net assets of non-US dollar denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the currency translation reserve CTR, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
Upon adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2004, accumulated exchange differences arising on consolidation prior to 31 December 2003 were reset to zero and the CTR recommenced under IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The balance on the CTR represents the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-US dollar amounts into US dollars since 1 January 2004.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
7 Taxation The taxation charge in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years profit before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years profits.
Current tax is the expected tax payable arising in the current year on the current years profit before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years profits.
Deferred tax is the expected tax payable on the current years profit before tax arising in a future year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
When items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Tax arising on the discharge of share options and awards is recognised directly in equity.
8 Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts.
Operating segments are components of the Group that are engaged in providing related products.
Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
9 Property, Plant and Equipment a General Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of drilling tools, which are depreciated using the units of production method, and oil and gas exploration and production equipment see 9 b below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
b Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category oil and gas exploration and development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.
10 Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Principal Accounting Policies continued 11 Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, or when this cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents ten to twelve years Unpatented technology ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years 12 Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
13 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
14 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
15 Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a loan or receivable is impaired and if necessary the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Loans and receivables cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
16 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
17 Provisions Provisions are liabilities for which the amount or timing of future expenditure is uncertain.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Whenever the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to their present value.
Hunting PLC 2014 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 144 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 43.
Principal Accounting Policies continued 18 Post-employment Benefits a Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
b Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which for the funded scheme is measured using the Projected Unit method and for the unfunded scheme is equal to the contributions paid.
Net interest arising on the net assets of the schemes is also recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of the funded scheme which are invested in insurance policies have been valued using the same methodology and assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation so that, where the assets match the liabilities, the value of the assets is equal to the value of the corresponding obligation.
19 Share-based Payments The Group issues LTIP awards that are share-based payments which can be settled in either cash or equity to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
A liability is recognised equal to the current fair value of the services received, determined at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each subsequent reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group also issues equity-settled share-based payments HPSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The obligation to settle these awards is recognised within other reserves.
20 Share Capital The Companys share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
21 Dividend Distributions Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders and are dealt with in the statement of changes in equity.
