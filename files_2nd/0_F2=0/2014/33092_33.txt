NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, property, plant and equipment, available for sale investments, and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
Going concern Under Provision C. 1.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board needs to report whether the business is a going concern.
In considering this requirement, the Directors have taken into account the following: The Groups latest rolling forecast for the next two years, in particular the cash flows, borrowings and undrawn facilities.
Sensitivity analysis is included within these forecasts.
The headroom under the Groups financial covenants.
The risks included on the Groups risk register that could impact on the Groups liquidity and solvency over the next 12 months.
The risks on the Groups risk register that could be a threat to the Groups business model and capital adequacy.
In particular the Directors have considered the relatively long-term and stable nature of the cash flows receivable under the tenant leases, the Groups loan-to-value ratio of 24%, the interest cover ratio of 286% and the 336m total of undrawn facilities and cash at 31 December 2014.
They have also considered the fact that after conversion of the 2.75% convertible bonds 2016 in January 2015 the proforma average maturity of borrowings was extended to 7.9 years.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the strategic report.
The strategic report also includes the Groups risks and risk management processes, as well as the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
Having due regard to these matters and after making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
2 Changes in accounting policies The principal accounting policies are described in note 41 and are consistent with those applied in its financial statements for theyear to 31 December 2013, as amended to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year as shown below.
New standards adopted during the year The following standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the EU were effective for the first time for the Groups 31December 2014 year end and had no material impact on the financial statements: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IAS 32 amended Financial Instruments: Presentation on Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: IAS 36 amended Impairment of Assets on Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets: IAS 39 amended Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting: and IFRIC 21 Levies.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective The following standards, amendments and interpretations were in issue at the date of approval of these financial statements butwere not yet effective for the current accounting year and have not been adopted early.
Based on the Groups current circumstances the Directors do not anticipate that their adoption in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 10 amended Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 amended Joint Arrangements: IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IAS 16 amended Property Plant and Equipment: IAS 19 amended Employee Benefits: IAS 27 amended Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: 128 Financial statements IAS 38 amended Intangible Assets: IAS 41 amended Agriculture: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 2012 Cycle : Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011 2013 Cycle : and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014.
3 Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
TheGroups significant accounting policies are stated in note 41.
Not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable underthe circumstances.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The following is intended to provide an understanding of the policies thatmanagement consider critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application andtheir impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Property portfolio valuation The Group uses the valuation carried out by its independent valuers as the fair value of its property portfolio.
The valuation isbased upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and theappropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
More information is provided in note 16.
Outstanding rent reviews Where the outcome of an outstanding rent review is reasonably certain, rent is accrued from the rent review date based upon anestimated annual rent.
This estimate is derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties and is only accrued where the outcome is considered to be reasonably certain.
Compliance with the real estate investment trust REIT taxation regime The Group is a REIT and is thereby exempt from tax on both rental profits and chargeable gains.
In order to retain REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the tax exempt business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is nolonger recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business which is within the REIT structure.
Contingent consideration Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is calculated using future discounted cash flows based on expected outcomes with estimated probabilities taking account of the risk and uncertainty ofeach input.
4 Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which in the Groups case is its Executive Committee comprising the six executive Directors and four senior managers in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal financial reports received by the Groups Executive Committee contain financial information at a Group level as awhole and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
These internal financial reports include the IFRS figures but also report the non-IFRS figures for the EPRA earnings per share, net asset value and profit figures.
Reconciliations of each of these figures to their statutory equivalents are detailed in note 38.
Additionally, information is provided to the Executive Committee showing gross property income and property valuation by individual property.
Therefore, for the purposes of IFRS 8, each individual property is considered to be a separate operating segment in that its performance is monitored individually.
The Groups property portfolio includes investment property, owner-occupied property and trading property and comprised 1 93%office buildings by value 2013: 93%.
The Directors consider that these properties have similar economic characteristics.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
The remaining 7% 2013: 7% represented a mixture of retail, hotel, residential and light industrial properties, as well as land, each of which is fide minimis in itsown right and below the quantitative threshold in aggregate.
Therefore, in the view of the Directors, there is one reportable segment under the provisions of IFRS 8.
1 Some office buildings have an ancillary element such as retail or residential.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 129 4 Segmental information continued All of the Groups properties are based in the UK.
At 31 December 2013, the Group also had a joint venture investment in Praguewhich represented 0.1% of the Groups assets and is excluded from this analysis.
This investment was sold in April 2014.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the Groups Executive Committee and, therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is required by IFRS 8.
However, geographical analysis is included in the tables below to provide users with additional information regarding the areas contained in the strategic report.
The majority oftheGroups properties are located in London West End central, West End borders and City borders, with the remainder inScotland Provincial.

The Group has included the income from this building within gross property income as, although similar to a lease surrender arrangement, the Groups entitlement to this rental income is linked to its continued ownership of the property rather than being an unconditional amount receivable whether as an upfront payment or through aseries of instalments.
Additionally, rental income includes 7.0m 2013: 5.6m relating to rents recognised in advance of thecash receipts.
Other property income relates to rights of light settlements received during the year, while other income relates to fees and commissions earned in relation to the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of services.
In 2014, there were no costs 2013: 0.4m included in net property and other income relating to properties which produced noincome during theyear.

The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of the options granted during 2013 and 2014 under the equity-settled employee share plan operated by the Group.
2014 2013 Option pricing model used Binomial lattice Binomial lattice Risk free interest rate 1.7% 0.8% Volatility 24.0% 25.0% Dividend yield 1.3% 1.5% For both the 2014 and 2013 grants, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 100% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last four years.
134 Financial statements Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc.
Alloutstanding options were exercised during 2014.
In 2013, a binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31 December 2013 of 24.95 and a dividend yield of 1.4% were used together with a risk-free interest rate of 0.3%.
An assumption of zero employee turnover was made and a volatility assumption of 17% pa was used for options with expected terms of one year, which covered all outstanding awards at 31 December 2013.
14 Pension costs The Group and Company operate both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007 and is closed to new members.
All new employees are entitled to join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
Defined contribution plan The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 1.2m 2013: 1.3m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with F&C Fund Management Limited, Legal and General Investment Management Limited and Ruffer LLP plus annuity policies held in the name of the scheme.

The value calculated in this way is reflected in the net liability asset in the balance sheet as shown above.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected earnings increases.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the plan liabilities, whose calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings increases.
In assessing thisfigure for the purpose of the disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory revaluation of benefits up to retirement for deferred pensioners but not for active members.
At the balance sheet date the accumulated benefit obligation was 15.1m 2013:11.1m.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.

None of the fair values of the assets shown above include any directly held financial instruments of the Group or property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
All of the scheme assets have a quoted market price in an active market withthe exception of the Trustees bank account balance representing Level 1 fair value measurement as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
It is the policy of the trustees and the Group to review the investment strategy at the time of each funding valuation.
The Trustees investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the plan investment strategy are illustrated by the asset allocation at 31 December 2014.
There are no asset-liability matching strategies currently being used by the plan.

The inflation sensitivity includes the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation, pension increases and salary growth.
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the year ended 31 December 2014 is 25 years.
The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, salary growth risk, mortality risk and longevity risk.
A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in the future.
This effect would be partially offset by anincrease in the plans bond holdings, and in qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk.
The best estimate of contributions to be paid by the Group to the plan for the year commencing 1 January 2015 is 0.7m.

When considering the highest and best use of a property, the external valuers will consider its existing andpotential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the external valuers will consider the costs and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at the property valuation.
CBRE Limited valued properties at 4,135.2m 2013: 3,322.8m and other valuers at 32.9m 2013: 30.3m.
Of the properties revalued by CBRE, 24.8m 2013: 19.7m relating to owner-occupied property was included within property, plant and equipment and 29.1m 2013: 24.7m was in relation to trading property.
138 Financial statements The total fees, including the fee for this assignment, earned by CBRE or other companies forming part of the same group of companies within the UK from the Group is less than 5.0% of their total UK revenues.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group transferred, at market value, properties previously held for investment to trading property as it became the Groups intention to redevelop and sell these properties.
Subsequent revaluation surpluses relating to trading property are recognised as an adjustment to EPRA net asset value, but, in accordance with IAS 2 Inventories, are not recognised in the carrying value of the property.

This information is derived from the Groups financial and property management systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
In addition, the valuation reports are based on assumptions and valuation models used by the external valuers.
The assumptions are typically market related, such as yields and discount rates, and are based on their professional judgement and market observation.
Eachproperty is considered a separate asset class based on the unique nature, characteristics and risks of the property.
Members of the Groups investments team, who report to the executive Director responsible for the valuation process, verify all major inputs to the external valuation reports, assess the individual property valuation changes from the prior year valuation report and hold discussions with the external valuers.
When this process is complete, the valuation report is recommended to the Audit Committee, which considers it as part of its overall responsibilities.
The external valuers hold meetings with the Auditor and then with the Audit Committee to discuss the valuation processes and outcome at each year end and half year end.
Valuation techniques The fair value of the property portfolio has been determined using an income capitalisation technique, whereby contracted andmarket rental values are capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against theequivalent yields and the fair market values per square foot derived from comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms.
For properties under construction, the fair value is calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the income capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
These techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and use significant unobservable inputssuch that the fair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair valuehierarchy.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 or between Levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy during either 2014 or 2013.
Gains and losses recorded in profit or loss for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair valuehierarchy amount to 667.1m 2013: 335.6m and are presented in the Group income statement in the line item revaluationsurplus.
The revaluation surplus for the owner-occupied property of 4.8m 2013: 1.9m was included within therevaluation reserve.
All gains and losses recorded in profit or loss in 2014 and 2013 for recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level3of the fair value hierarchy are attributable to changes in unrealised gains or losses relating to investment property held at31December 2014 and 31 December 2013, respectively.

Sensitivity of measurement to variations in the significant unobservable inputs The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the Groups property portfolio, together with the impact of significant movements in these inputs on the fair value measurement, are shown below: Impact on fair value measurement Impact on fair value measurement Unobservable input of significant increase in input of significant decrease in input Gross ERV Increase Decrease Net initial yield Decrease Increase Reversionary yield Decrease Increase True equivalent yield Decrease Increase There are inter-relationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market rate conditions.
An increase in the reversionary yield may accompany an increase in gross ERV and would mitigate its impact on the fair value measurement.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on the fair value of a 25 basis point shift in true equivalent yield and a2.50 per sq ft shift in ERV.

The Companys accounting policy is to carry investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and recoverable amount andrecognise any impairment, or reversal thereof, in the income statement.
In the opinion of the Directors, the most appropriate estimate of the fair value of LMS is the net asset value of its subsidiaries.
Principally due to the valuation movement in investment properties, there has been an increase in the net asset value of these subsidiaries which resulted in an impairment reversal in theCompany income statement of 285.5m.
In 2013, there was a decrease in the net asset value mainly asaresult of dividends paid by LMS in the year, which resulted in an impairment in the Company income statement of43.3m.

This unsecured instrument paid a coupon of 2.75% until January 2015 when it was redeemed.
The conversion price was 22.22 per share.
In accordance with IAS 32, the equity and debt components of the bond have been accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component was determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond, deemed to be 3.99%.
As a result, 165.4m was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6m, which represent the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value has been amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 4.8m were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component has been amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2m have not been amortised.
The fair value was determined by the ask-price of 135.71 per 100 as at 31 December 2014 2013: 122.34 per 100.
In December 2014, the Group issued a notice for the early redemption of these bonds prior to 30 January 2015.
All the bonds converted after the year end into new ordinary shares of 5p each and were subsequently cancelled.
The bonds have therefore been included in current liabilities at 31 December 2014.

The funds were drawn on 8 January 2014.
The fair values were determined by comparing the discounted future cashflows using the contracted yields with those of the reference gilts plus the implied margins.
The references were a 6% 2028gilt and a 4.25% 2032 gilt both with an implied margin which is unchanged since the date of fixing.

In December 2014, an agreement was signed to amend and extend the 550m facility arranged in September 2013 with a reduced margin and a revised maturity.
The margin charged on the amended 550m facility is close to the margin charged on the bank facilities not previously refinanced.
The fair values of the Groups bank loans are therefore deemed to be approximately the same as their carrying amount, after adjusting for the unamortised arrangement fees.

As with the bonds, debt and equity components of the intercompany loans have been accounted for separately, and the fair value of the debt components is identical to that of the bonds.
Derivative financial instruments The derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps, the fair values of which represent the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31 December 2014 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
The Group also has a 70m forward starting interest rate swap effective from 30 March 2015.
This swap is not included in the 31December 2014 figures in the table below, but the financial impact from the effective date onwards is included in the relevant tables in this note.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated using the mid-point of the yield curves prevailing on the reporting date and represent the net present value of the differences between the contracted rate and the valuation rate when applied to the projected balances for the period from the reporting date to the contracted expiry dates.

148 Financial statements Contractual undiscounted cash outflows IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, requires disclosure of the maturity of the Groups and Companys remaining contractual financial liabilities.
The tables below show the contractual undiscounted cash outflows arising from the Groups gross debt.
These amounts represent the gross cash flows of the derivative financial instruments and are settled aseither a net payment or receipt.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Further information on risk as required by IFRS 7 is given on pages 22 to 27 and page 87.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous years.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables, cash at bank, trade and other payables, floating rate bank loans, fixed rate loans and private placement notes, secured and unsecured bonds and interest rate swaps.
General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority to executive management for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups flexibility and its ability to maximise returns.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from lease contracts in relation to its property portfolio.
It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new tenants before entering into such contracts.
The Board has established a credit committee which assesses each new tenant before a new lease is signed.
The review includes the latest sets of financial statements, external ratings, when available, and, in some cases, forecast information and bank and trade references.
The covenant strength of each tenant is determined based on this review and, if appropriate, a deposit or a guarantee is obtained.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 151 24 Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the wide range of tenants from a broad spectrum of business sectors.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of investment grade are accepted.
This risk is also reduced by the short periods that money is on deposit at any one time.
The quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are disclosed in note 20.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk arises for the Group from its use of variable interest bearing instruments interest rate risk.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates would result in an increase of 0.3m 2013: 0.8m or a decrease of 0.3m 2013: 0.8m.
It is currently Group policy that generally between 60% and 85% of external Group borrowings excluding finance lease payables are at fixed rates.
Where the Group wishes to vary the amount of external fixed rate debt it holds subject to it being generally between 60% and 85% of expected Group borrowings, as noted above, the Group makes use of interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from therisk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2014, the proportion of fixed debt held by the Group was above this range at 94% 2013: 83%.
During both 2014 and 2013, the Groups borrowings atvariable rate were denominated in sterling.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
The Group generally raises long-term borrowings at fixed rates.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on itsdebt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient headroom in its loan facilities to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain committed facilities to meet the expected requirements.
The Group also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates and hence cash flows on a portion of its long-term borrowings.
This is further explained in the market risk section above.
Executive management receives rolling three-year projections of cash flow and loan balances on a regular basis as part of the Groups forecasting processes.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The Groups loan facilities and other borrowings are spread across a range of banks and financial institutions so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.
The liquidity risk of the Group is managed centrally by the finance department.
Capital disclosures The Groups capital comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, other reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interest.
The Groups objectives when maintaining capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide above average long-term returns for shareholders: and to provide an above average annualised total return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders subject to the rules imposed by its REIT status.
It may also seek to redeem bonds, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets toreduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of NAV gearing and loan-to-value ratio.
During 2014, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2013, was to maintain the NAV gearing below 80% in normal circumstances.
These two gearing ratios, as well as the interest cover ratio, are defined at the end of this announcement and are derived in note 40.

Further to the announcement made in December 2014 for early redemption of the 2.75% unsecured convertible bonds 2016, the Group received notices from 100% of the bondholders in January 2015 confirming that they would be taking up their options to convert in full.
This subsequently led to the cancellation of the bonds and the issue of 7,875,776 new 5p ordinary shares.

In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share, the effect ofthe conversion of the bonds is required to be recognised if they are dilutive, and not recognised if they are anti-dilutive.
For 2014 and 2013, the shares attributable to the conversion of the 2016 bonds were dilutive for net asset value NAV and EPRA NAV per share and unadjusted earnings per share but anti-dilutive for EPRA earnings per share.
For 2014 and 2013, the shares attributable to the conversion of the 2019 bonds were dilutive for unadjusted earnings per share but anti-dilutive for EPRA earnings per share and all NAV per share measures.

Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as permitted by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and following the procedures for this method set out in IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the period to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2014 165 41 Significant accounting policies continued Gross property income Gross property income arises from two main sources: i Rental income This arises from operating leases granted to tenants.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
A finance lease is one whereby substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the lessee.
Rental income is recognised in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in accordance with SIC 15 Operating Leases Incentives and IAS 17 Leases.
This includes the effect of lease incentives given to tenants, which are normally in the form of rent free or half rent periods or capital contributions in lieu of rent free periods, and the effect of contracted rent uplifts and payments received from tenants on the grant of leases.
For income from property leased out under a finance lease, a lease receivable asset is recognised in the balance sheet at anamount equal to the net investment in the lease, as defined in IAS 17 Leases.
Minimum lease payments receivable, again defined in IAS 17, are apportioned between finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Contingent rents, being the difference between the rent currently receivable and the minimum lease payments when the net investment in the lease was originally calculated, are recognised in property income in the years in which they are receivable.
ii Surrender premiums Payments received from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Other income Other income consists of commissions and fees arising from the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of service.
Expenses i Lease payments Where investment properties are held under operating leases, the leasehold interest is classified as if it were held under a finance lease, which is recognised at its fair value on the balance sheet, within the investment property carrying value.
Upon initial recognition, a corresponding liability is included as a finance lease liability.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability so as to produce aconstant periodic rate of interest on the remaining finance lease liability.
Contingent rents payable, being the difference between the rent currently payable and the minimum lease payments when the lease liability was originally calculated, are charged as expenses within property expenditure in the years in which they are payable.
ii Dilapidations Dilapidations monies received from tenants in respect of their lease obligations are recognised immediately inthe Group income statement, unless they relate to future capital expenditure.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iii Reverse surrender premiums Payments made to tenants to surrender their lease obligations are charged directly to the Group income statement unless the payment is to enable the probable redevelopment of a property.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable, they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iv Other property expenditure Vacant property costs and other property costs are expensed in the year to which they relate, with the exception of the initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging leases which are, in accordance with IAS 17 Leases, added to the carrying value of the relevant property and recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
Employee benefits i Share-based remuneration a Equity-settled The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and share option scheme.
The fair value of the conditional awards of shares granted under the long-term incentive plan and the options granted under the share optionscheme are determined at the date of grant.
This fair value is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the non-market based performance criteria of the long-term incentive plan are reconsidered and the expense is revised as necessary.
In respect of the share option scheme, the fair value of the options granted is calculated using a binomial lattice pricing model.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, no expense is recognised for options or conditional shares granted on or before 7 November 2002. b Cash-settled For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised based on the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
The movement in the current fair value is taken to the Group income statement.
ii Pensions a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Group income statement in the period to which they relate.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned inreturn for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and thefair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gain or loss in the period is recognised in full in theGroup statement of comprehensive income.
166 Financial statements Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon isrecognised as goodwill.
Any discount is credited to the Group income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any residual goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment property i Valuation Investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, including those that are undergoing redevelopment.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, they are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value adjusted for the carrying value of leasehold interests and lease incentive and letting cost receivables.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an investment property in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The valuation is undertaken by independent valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in the locations and categories of properties being valued.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are reported in the Group income statement in the year in which they arise.
ii Capital expenditure Capital expenditure, being costs directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of an investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, are capitalised in the carrying value of that property.
In addition, in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs, finance costs that are directly attributable to such expenditure are capitalised using the Groups average cost of borrowings during each quarter.
iii Disposal Properties are treated as disposed when the Group transfers the significant risks and rewards of ownership to thebuyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
On disposal, any gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value at the last year end plus subsequent capitalised expenditure during the year.
Where the net disposal proceeds have yet to be finalised at the balance sheet date, the proceeds recognised reflect the Directors best estimate of the amounts expected to be received.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is calculated using future discounted cash flows based onexpected outcomes with estimated probabilities taking account of the risk and uncertainty of each input.
iv Development When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued use as an investment property or acquires a property with the subsequent intention of developing as an investment property, the property is classified as an investment property and is accounted for as such.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sale, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is remeasured to fair value as at the date of transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The remeasured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Property, plant and equipment i Owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property is stated at its revalued amount, which is determined in the same manner as investment property.
It is depreciated over its remaining useful life 40 years with the depreciation included in administrative expenses.
On revaluation, any accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of theproperty concerned, and the net amount restated to the revalued amount.
Subsequent depreciation charges are adjusted based on the revalued amount for each property.
Any difference between the depreciation charge on the revalued amount and that which would have been charged under historic cost is transferred, net of any related deferred tax, between the revaluation reserve and retained earnings as the property is utilised.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The land element of the property is not depreciated.
ii Artwork Artwork is stated at revalued amounts on the basis of open market value.
iii Other Plant and equipment is depreciated at a rate of between 10% and 25% per annum which is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of the individual assets, over their expected useful lives.
Investments Investments in joint ventures, being those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, as established by contractual agreement, are included in the Groups balance sheet at cost together with the Groups share of post-acquisition reserves, on a net equity basis.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are included in the Companys balance sheet at the lower of cost and recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met if the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale inits present condition, being actively marketed and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets, including related liabilities, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs of disposal.

Financial liabilities i Bank loans and fixed rate loans Bank loans and fixed rate loans are included as financial liabilities on the balance sheets atthe amounts drawn on the particular facilities.
Interest payable is expensed as a finance cost in the year to which it relates.
ii Non-convertible bonds These are included as a financial liability on the balance sheet net of the unamortised discount andcosts on issue.
The difference between this carrying value and the redemption value is recognised in the Group income statement over the life of the bond on an effective interest basis.
Interest payable to bond holders is expensed in the year towhich it relates.
iii Convertible bonds The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option.
This is recognised and included in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently re-measured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The issue costs apportioned to the liability are amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity are not amortised.
iv Finance lease liabilities Finance lease liabilities arise for those investment properties held under a leasehold interest and accounted for as investment property.
The liability is initially calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments, reducing in subsequent years by the apportionment of payments to the lessor, as described above under the heading for lease payments.
v Interest rate derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the financing of the Groups business.
No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
At each reporting date, these interest rate derivatives are measured at fair value, being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit rating of the counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement is recognised in the Group income statement because the Group does not apply hedge accounting.
vi Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the tax computations, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In respect of the deferred tax on the revaluation surplus, this is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment portfolio as at the reporting date.
The calculation takes account of available indexation on the historic cost of the properties.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period, based on Acts substantially enacted at the year end, when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is included in profit or loss for the period, except when itrelates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends payable on the ordinary share capital are recognised in the year in which they are declared.
Foreign currency translation On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statement and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Group income statement.
