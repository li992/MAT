The Merchants Trust PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 January 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2015 17.
Financial Risk Management Policies and Procedures The company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment policy as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment policy, the company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are: market risk comprising market price risk, market yield risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors determine the objectives and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
The investment manager, in close co-operation with the directors, implement the companys risk management policies.
The companys policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments to moderate risk exposure and to generate additional revenue.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding period.
a Market Risk The investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Market risk comprises market price risk, market yield risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
i Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
Changes in stock market valuations lead to changes in gearing ratios.
The boards procedure for monitoring the gearing of the company is set out in Note 18 on page 74.
This takes into account the investment managers view on the market, covenant requirements and the future prospects of the companys performance.
Market price risk sensitivity The value of the companys listed investments i. e fixed asset investments, excluding unlisted equities which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January 2015 was as follows: 2015 2014 Listed investments held at fair value through profit or loss 666,027,618 631,224,383 Derivative financial instruments - written call options 310,200 75,000 Total listed investments 665,717,418 631,149,383 The following illustrates the sensitivity of the return and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2014 - 20% in the fair values of the companys listed investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in the recent years.
The sensitivity analysis on the net return after tax is based on the impact of a 20% increase or decrease in the value of the companys listed equity investments at each balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.

A dedicated investment manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the companys investment objectives and to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Call options are only written on stock owned within the portfolio, with a maximum exposure of 15% of gross assets at the time of writing the call.
ii Market Yield Risk Market yield risk arises from the uncertainty about the companys ability to maintain its income objectives due to systematic decline in corporate dividend levels.
Where call options are sold written, in all cases a sufficient position is maintained in the underlying equity to cover any potential option exercise.
Whilst the option value can be volatile, price movements should to some extent be offset by opposing movements in the value of the underlying equity.
If options are retained until expiry they will either expire worthless or be exercised.
The effect of any option exercise is to sell the underlying shares at the strike price of the option.
A schedule of the companys listed holdings is shown on pages 24 and 25.
Where put options are purchased, the market value of such options can be volatile but the maximum loss on any contract is limited to the original investment cost.
No put options were purchased in the year see Note 1 on page 58 for detail of income received.. Further explanation of the derivative strategy is included in the Investment Managers Review on pages 20 and 21.
Management of market yield risk The directors regularly review the current and projected yield of the investment portfolio, and discuss with the investment manager the extent to which it will enable the company to meet its investment income objective.
iii Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of the movement in the values of overseas financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates.
Management of foreign currency risk The company invests predominantly in UK listed equities and has no significant exposure to currencies other than sterling 2014 - no significant exposure.
Any income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The company does not hedge against foreign currency exposure.
iv Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
69 The Merchants Trust PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 January 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2015 Interest Rate Exposure The table below summarises in sterling terms the financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are directly affected by changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate interest bearing liabilities bear the following coupon and effective rates as at 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2014.
Amount Effective Maturity borrowed Coupon rate since date rate inception First Debenture Finance PLC FDF - Bonds 02 01 2018 5,133,520 14.75% 11.28% First Debenture Finance PLC FDF - Notes 02 01 2018 20,534,079 14.75% 11.28% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust - Original Loan 20 05 2023 30,000,000 9.25125% 9.51% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust - Additional Loan 20 05 2023 12,000,000 9.25125% 6.00% 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 20 12 2029 30,000,000 5.875% 6.23% 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock n a 1,375,000 4.00% 4.00% 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock n a 1,178,000 3.65% 3.65% 100,220,599 The effective rates are calculated in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as detailed in the Statement of Accounting Policies on page 57.
The details in respect of the above loans have remained unchanged since the previous accounting period.
The weighted average effective rate of the companys fixed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock and the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock is 8.54% 2014 - 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 9.2 years 2014 - 10.2 years.
The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
Therefore the companys net return and net assets, are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
70 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2015 Management of interest rate risk The company invests predominantly in equities, the values of which are not directly affected by changes in prevailing market interest rates.
In the year to 31 January 2015, the company held no fixed interest securities.
The companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested and thus does not expect to hold significant cash balances.
The financial assets have minimal exposure to interest rate risk.
The company finances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained earnings and long term borrowings.
Movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the finance costs and financial liabilities of the company as all the borrowings of the company are subject to fixed rates of interest.
b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk relates to the capacity to meet liabilities as they fall due and is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets.
Maturity of financial liabilities The table below presents the future cash flows payable by the company in respect of its financial liabilities.
Cash flows in respect of the principal and interest on the Stepped Rate Interest Loan, Fixed Rate Interest Loan and 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 reflect the maturity dates as set out in Note 10 on pages 63 to 65.
The loans are each governed by a trust deed.
Only if the covenants are breached would early repayment be enforced.
Therefore their repayment is not considered to be a likely short term liquidity issue.
Cash flows in respect of the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock, which have no fixed repayment date, assumes maturity of 20 years from the balance sheet date.
Cash flows have not been discounted.

Short term flexibility can be achieved through the use of overdraft facilities, where necessary.
As at the 31 January 2015, the company had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of 10 million 2014 - 10 million.
c Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of default by a counterparty in discharging its obligations under transactions that could result in the company suffering a loss.
Management of credit risk Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed quarterly by the investment manager.
The company is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The companys cash balances are held by HSBC Bank PLC, rated Aa3 by Moodys rating agency.
The directors believe the counterparties the company has chosen to transact with are of high credit quality, therefore the company has minimal exposure to credit risk.
The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the company as at 31 January: 2015 2014 Debtors Outstanding settlements - 1,608,489 Share issue - 487,024 Accrued income 1,026,432 1,621,028 Other debtors 25,446 26,425 1,051,878 3,742,966 Cash at bank 8,654,487 8,083,385 9,706,365 11,826,351 Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities With the exception of those financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried at their fair value, or the balance sheet amount is considered to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, including interest on outstanding borrowings due within one year, have the following fair values : 2015 2015 2014 2014 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Stepped Rate Interest Loan 34,347,838 42,660,173 34,341,945 43,935,611 Fixed Rate Interest Loan 45,418,206 61,337,594 45,642,057 57,410,686 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 29,458,954 39,176,930 29,428,809 33,780,306 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock 1,388,751 1,167,261 1,388,751 944,039 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock 1,178,000 925,598 1,199,499 751,091 111,791,749 145,267,556 112,001,061 136,821,733 72 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January 2015 The net asset value per ordinary share, with debt at fair value is calculated as follows: 2015 2014 Net assets per balance sheet 562,008,943 529,478,058 Add: financial liabilities at book value 111,791,749 112,001,061 Less: financial liabilities at fair value 145,267,556 136,821,733 Net assets debt at fair value 528,533,136 504,657,386 Net asset value per ordinary share debt at fair value 486.1p 486.8p The fair value has been derived from the closing market value as at 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2014.
The net asset value per ordinary share is based on 108,728,464 ordinary shares in issue at 31 January 2015 2014 - 103,663,464.
FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures has been expanded to include a fair value hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurement of financial instruments.
As at 31 January 2015, the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss of 665,745,387 2014 - 631,181,415 are categorised as follows: 2015 2014 Level 1 665,717,418 631,149,383 Level 2 - - Level 3 27,969 32,032 665,745,387 631,181,415 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 - valued using quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1.
Level 3 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
A reconciliation of the fair value movements in Level 3 is set out below: Opening fair value of level 3 32,032 W & G Investment delisted holding redeemed 4,063 Closing fair value of level 3 27,969 73
