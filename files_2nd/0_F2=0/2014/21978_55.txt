Loans and other borrowings continued BT Group plc groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which BT Group plc manages as capital.
2014 2013 At 31 March m m BT Group plc consolidated net debt 7,028 7,797 a BT Group plc shareholders deficit equity 610 276 6,418 7,521 a Excludes non-controlling interests of 18m 2012 13: 14m.
Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure for BT Group plc, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to net debt is given below.

Loans and other borrowings continued Unless designated in a fair value hedge relationship, all loans and other borrowings are carried in the group balance sheet and table above at amortised cost.
The fair value of listed bonds is 10,597m 2012 13: 10,535m and the fair value of finance leases is 286m 2012 13: 314m.
The fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings are estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities, where they exist and a calculation of the value of future cash ows using approximate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date where market prices of similar issues exist.
The carrying amount of commercial paper, other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
Loans and other borrowings are analysed as follows: 2014 2013 At 31 March m m Current liabilities Listed bonds 1,349 566 Finance leases 14 7 Commercial paper 324 769 Other loans and bank overdrafts 186 394 Total current liabilities 1,873 1,736 Non-current liabilities Listed bonds 7,689 8,010 Finance leases 250 265 Other loans and borrowings 2 2 Total non-current liabilities 7,941 8,277 Total 9,814 10,013 The carrying values disclosed in the above table reect balances at amortised cost adjusted for accrued interest and current fair value adjustments to the relevant loans or borrowings.
These do not reect the final principal repayments that will arise after taking account of the relevant derivatives in hedging relationships which are reected in the table below.
Apart from finance leases, all borrowings as at 31 March 2014 and 2013 were unsecured.
The principal repayments of loans and borrowings at hedged rates amounted to 9,496m 2012 13: 9,251m and repayments fall due as follows: 2014 2013 Carrying Effect of hedging Principal repayments Carrying Effect of hedging Principal repayments a a amount and interest at hedged rates amount and interest at hedged rates At 31 March m m m m m m Within one year, or on demand 1,873 183 1,690 1,736 264 1,472 Between one and two years 1,291 7 1,284 1,155 9 1,164 Between two and three years 1,353 36 1,389 1,352 69 1,283 Between three and four years 1,172 111 1,061 693 693 Between four and five years 492 7 499 1,235 174 1,061 After five years 3,572 1 3,573 3,734 156 3,578 Total due for repayment after more than one year 7,880 74 7,806 8,169 390 7,779 Total repayments 9,753 257 9,496 9,905 654 9,251 Fair value adjustments for hedged risk 61 108 Total loans and other borrowings 9,814 10,013 a Adjustments for hedging and interest reflect the impact of the currency element of derivatives and adjust the repayments to exclude interest recognised in the carrying amount.
