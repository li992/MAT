Strategic Report Governance Financial 87 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
As more fully detailed in the Directors report, the groups financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The groups financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are required to be measured at fair value.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013, except for the adoption of the following new standards and amendments for the first time in the current period: Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits impact the measurement of various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the groups total obligation.
The amendment has no cash impact.
Prior year comparatives have been restated.
The headline operating profit for the year to 31 March 2014 was reduced by 1.3m, finance costs were increased by 1.4m and the tax charge decreased by 0.6m under the revised standard, with other comprehensive income increased by 2.1m for the same period.
The headline operating profit for the year to 31 March 2013 was reduced by 1.7m, finance costs were increased by 0.8m and the tax charge decreased by 0.6m under the revised standard, with other comprehensive income increased by 1.9m for the same period: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement has resulted in increased disclosure during the year of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value see Note 25 : Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements have increased the disclosure within the statement of comprehensive income by separating items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit and loss from those that could be reclassified.
Comparative information has been re-presented.
The amendments affect presentation only and there is no impact on profit or loss and total comprehensive income: Amendments resulting from May 2012 Improvements to IFRSs: and Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet mandatorily effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 Transition Guidance: Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities: Amendments to IAS 39: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting: Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets: IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies: Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Employee Contributions: Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations: Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation: and Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle and 2011-2013 Cycle.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU will have a material financial impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Mitie Group plc 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Significant accounting policies under IFRS The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the groups IFRS financial information are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mitie Group plc and all its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the parent company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP with the exception of a small number of entities.
Adjustments are made in the consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
Interests of non-controlling interest shareholders are measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on such transactions and goodwill is not re-measured.
Any difference between the change in the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Foreign currency The financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the groups hedging and translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue represents income recognised in respect of services provided during the period stated net of sales taxes and is earned predominantly within the United Kingdom.
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour hours and tasks are delivered and direct expenses incurred.
In other cases, where services provided reflect a contractual arrangement to deliver an indeterminate number of acts over the contract term, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis unless this is not an accurate reflection of the work performed.
Where a straight-line basis is not appropriate, for example if specific works on contracts represent a significant element of the whole, revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method, based on the proportion of costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated cost of completing the contracted work.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 89 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end.
Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In calculating this, the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost.
Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses are forecast.
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less amounts billed on account.
To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when: there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities: when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority: and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
It is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Mitie Group plc 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less expected residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements period of the lease Plant and vehicles 310 years Annually the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Intangible assets Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Software and development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Joint ventures and associates The group has an interest in joint ventures which are entities in which the group has joint control of financial and operating policies.
The group also has an interest in associates which are entities in which the group has significant influence.
The group accounts for its interest in joint ventures and associates using the equity method.
Under the equity method the groups share of the post-tax result of joint ventures and associates is reported as a single line item in the consolidated income statement.
The groups interest in joint ventures and associates is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the groups share of net assets.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling costs.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Bid, mobilisation and pre-contract costs Rendering of services All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of the costs is virtually certain.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 91 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies The confirmation of the preferred bidder for a contract by a client is the point at which the award of a contract is considered to be virtually certain.
Costs incurred after that point, but before the commencement of services under the contract, are defined as mobilisation costs.
These costs are capitalised and included within trade and other receivables on the balance sheet provided that the costs relate directly to the contract, are separately identifiable, can be measured reliably and that the future net cash inflows from the contract are estimated to be no less than the amounts capitalised.
The capitalised mobilisation costs are amortised over the life of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis, or on a basis to reflect the profile of work to be performed over the life of the contract if the straight-line basis is not considered to be appropriate for the specific contract to which the costs relate.
If the contract becomes loss making, any unamortised costs are written off immediately.
Construction contracts In the case of construction contracts, pre-contract costs that are direct costs associated with securing a contract and which can be separately identified and measured reliably are included in the cost of the contract when the realisation of income from the contract is virtually certain.
Their treatment is as for mobilisation costs above.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights and obligations are transferred, discharged or expire.
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the groups past experience of collecting payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities comprise trade payables, financing liabilities, including bank and other borrowings, and deferred contingent consideration.
These are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value, and deferred contingent consideration which is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation.
Bank and other borrowings are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of transaction costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the groups exposure to financial risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value, determined by reference to market rates, at each balance sheet date and included as financial assets or liabilities as appropriate.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The group may designate certain hedging instruments including derivatives as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Mitie Group plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Fair value hedges Hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement relating to the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with either a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity within the groups translation and hedging reserve.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the foreign currency exposure to changes in the groups share in the net assets of a foreign operation.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the groups translation and hedging reserve.
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same way as exchange differences relating to the foreign operation as described above.
Leasing Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Any lease incentives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period for which the group has contracted to lease the asset, together with any further terms for which the group has the option to continue to lease the asset if, at the inception of the lease, it is judged to be reasonably certain that the group will exercise the option.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 93 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where applicable, the consideration for an acquisition includes any assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they result from additional information, obtained within one year from the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39, either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Any business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 were accounted for using the standards in place prior to the adoption of IFRS 3 revised 2008 which differ in the following respects: transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs: contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable: and subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill.
Share-based payments The group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Save As You Earn SAYE options are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the related expense.
Retirement benefit costs The group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the schemes in which the group participates, the group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation which is for a fixed period only.
In addition, the group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current service cost and past service cost are recognised in profit and loss, in administrative expenses, whilst the net interest cost is recognised in net finance costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Mitie Group plc 94 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs.
Accounting for joint ventures and associates The group has interests in entities in which it considers that it does not have control and which are accounted for using the equity method.
In the group accounts, consideration is given to the treatment that should be adopted for the results of those entities in which the group has a participation, taking into account the ownership of the entity and the groups influence over its control.
These considerations determine whether the entity should be consolidated in the accounts as a subsidiary or equity accounted as a joint venture or associate.
A change in the judgement around Mities influence on the control of an entity in which the group participates may determine that the entity should be consolidated.
It is not currently expected that entities currently accounted for under the equity method would be treated differently in the year ended 31 March 2015 following the adoption of IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Measurement and impairment of intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of suitable discount rates.
Determining whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is 538.9m 2013: 535.2m at the balance sheet date: see Notes 13 and 14.
Management do not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment.
Measurement of provisions and defined benefit pension obligations The groups provisions per Note 26 comprise deferred contingent consideration and insurance reserves.
The measurement of provisions and defined benefit obligations requires judgement.
In particular, the calculation of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, life expectancy rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates.
The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 179.1m 2013: 171.8m : see Note 35.
The sensitivity of defined benefit pension obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below: Increase decrease Change in in liability assumption m Discount rate 0.5% 15.3 -0.5% 15.3 Retail Price Inflation 0.5% 12.1 -0.5% 12.1 Consumer Price Inflation 0.5% 3.2 -0.5% 3.2 Salary increases 0.5% 3.2 -0.5% 3.2 Life expectancy 1 year 4.8 Strategic Report Governance Financial 95 3 Revenue 2014 2013 m m 2,113.2 Rendering of services 1,918.9 107.9 Construction contracts 201.6 Total revenue as disclosed in the consolidated income statement 2,221.1 2,120.5 Investment revenue Note 8 1.2 0.5 Total revenue as defined in IAS 18 2,222.3 2,121.0 4 Business and geographical segments The group manages its business on a service division basis.
These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its primary segmental information.
The Healthcare division is the acquired Enara and Complete Group businesses.
2 Headline revenue and operating profit exclude other items which are analysed in Note 5.
3 This includes costs relating to the integration of Enara, UK CRBs and Complete Group of 4.4m 2013: 3.7m, acquisition costs of 0.7m 2013: 3.2m, and the amortisation of acquisition related intangibles of 11.0m 2013: 10.0m, see Note 5.
With effect from 1 April 2014 our operating divisions are as follows: Facilities Management has been split into Soft FM and Hard FM.
Hard FM also includes some of the niche services previously reported within the Property Management division.

The revenue analysis above is net of inter segment sales which are not considered significant.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of external revenue in 2014 or 2013.
The Improvement to IFRS 8 issued in April 2009 clarified that a measure of segment assets should be disclosed only if that amount is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and consequently no segment assets are disclosed.

5 Other items The group separately identifies and discloses restructuring and acquisition related items termed other items.
The results of the cyclical mechanical and electrical engineering contracting businesses which are being exited are also presented in other items.
During the year those businesses generated revenue of 78.5m 2013: 139.9m, and incurred a trading loss of 13.6m 2013: 3.1m and business closure costs of nil 2013: 22.1m.
The businesses being exited do not meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5 Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations because the businesses have not been disposed of and there are no assets classified as held for sale.
Accordingly the disclosures within non-headline items differ from those applicable for discontinued operations.
The exceptional charges in relation to design and build contracts in Energy Solutions of 25.4m 2013: nil have also been presented in other items.
Following the groups decision to reduce its exposure to the design and build element of its Energy Solutions business, it has reassessed the recoverability of certain of its contract-related debtors, the carrying value of certain of its assets and the requirement to provide for the settlement of certain of its contract obligations.
During the year, following a strategic review of the Mitie Group defined benefit pension scheme, a cap on increases in pensionable pay was introduced.
This led to a reduction in the defined benefit pension deficit of 10.5m at the date when the plan amendment occurred and was accounted for as a negative past service cost in accordance with IAS 19 see Note 35.
The net reported credit after costs incurred of 0.3m was 10.2m.
Restructuring costs in the prior year principally reflect the reorganisation of the overhead cost base in two divisions.

Mitie Group plc 102 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 13 Goodwill Cost m At 1 April 2012 347.7 Acquisition of subsidiaries 100.3 Impact of foreign exchange 0.1 Change in deferred contingent consideration for subsidiaries acquired prior to 31 March 2010 0.9 At 1 April 2013 447.2 Acquisition of subsidiaries 12.7 Impact of foreign exchange 0.3 459.6 At 31 March 2014 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 April 2012 At 1 April 2013 At 31 March 2014 Carrying amount 459.6 At 31 March 2014 At 31 March 2013 447.2 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Additions during the year relate to goodwill recognised on two acquisitions and finalisation of the acquisition accounting for acquisitions made in the prior year.
More details are presented in the Acquisitions note Note 31.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs, which align with the business segments, as this is how goodwill is monitored by the group internally.
Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Initial Security in 2006, Dalkia Technical Facilities Management in 2009 and Enara in 2012.
Discount rate Discount rate Goodwill Goodwill 2014 2013 2014 2013 % % m m Facilities Management 9.8 8.2 251.9 250.9 11.0 85.2 Property Management 9.5 85.2 11.0 105.0 Healthcare 9.5 93.6 Energy Solutions 12.0 10.7 17.5 17.5 459.6 447.2 The group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill may be impaired.
Key assumptions The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Growth rates and terminal values The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent one year financial budgets approved by the Board, extrapolated for four future years by a growth rate applicable to each unit with a terminal value using a 2% inflationary growth rate assumption.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 103 13 Goodwill Discount rates The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are derived from the Companys post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which was 8.2% 2013: 6.8% at 31 March 2014, and adjusted for the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
All CGUs have the same access to the groups Treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed and Management has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment of the goodwill of any of the CGUs.
In particular, a 1% increase in the discount rate or a 1% decrease in the terminal value growth rate would not result in an impairment in any of the CGUs.
These currently range from six to eight years.
Other acquisition related intangibles include acquired software, trade names and non-compete agreements and are amortised over their useful lives which currently range from three to ten years.
Software and development costs are amortised over their useful lives of between five and ten years, once they have been brought into use.

In addition the group has 0.8m 2013: 0.7m of capital losses.
The UK Government announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014, with a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015, which were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
The reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse has resulted in a deferred tax credit of 1.0m to the income statement.

Included in current liabilities are 2.7m 2013: 2.7m of obligations under finance leases see Note 27.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments and the private placement notes, all financing liabilities are held at amortised cost.
The Directors estimate that their carrying value approximates their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied see Note 25.
The carrying value of the private placement notes at 31 March 2014 includes a fair value adjustment for interest rate and currency risk of 0.6m 2013: 1.7m.
The fair value of the private placement notes is not significantly different from their carrying value.
Private placement notes On 13 December 2012, the group issued US$153.0m and 55.0m of private placement PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
This followed the issue on 16 December 2010 of US$96.0m and 40.0m of PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
The PP notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to manage the groups finance costs through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps.

The facilities have an expiry date of September 2015.
The loans carry interest rates which are currently determined at 1.5% over LIBOR.
Details of the groups contingent liabilities are provided in Note 32.
Mitie Group plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 25 Financial instruments Classification The groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and financing assets.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
The groups principal financial liabilities are trade payables, financing liabilities and deferred contingent consideration.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, private placement notes and deferred contingent consideration, all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments, and private placement loan notes are measured initially at fair value at the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied.
Deferred contingent consideration is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expense for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 1.
Risk management objectives The groups treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group.
These risks include those arising from interest rates, foreign currencies, liquidity, credit and capital management.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using effective control measures and, where appropriate, derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by group policies and reviewed regularly.
Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments.
The risk management policies remain unchanged from the previous year.
Interest rate risk The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates.
The groups Treasury function reviews its risk management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk.
Having issued US$249.0m and 95.0m of notes in the US PP fixed rate market, the group has swapped US$48.0m into floating rate debt.
Details of derivative financial instruments are given in Derivative financial instruments below.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
All financial liabilities, other than financing liabilities, are interest free.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2014 and reserves would decrease increase by 0.2m 2013: 0.5m.
Foreign currency risk The group has limited exposure to transactional foreign currency risk from trading transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of individual group entities and some exposure to translational foreign currency risk from the translation of its operations in Europe.
The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately and will enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate any significant risks.
In addition, the group has fully hedged the US dollar exposure on its PP notes into sterling using cross currency interest rate swaps see Hedging activities below.
At 31 March 2014 3.9m 2013: 6.0m of cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign currencies.
Included in bank loans were 15.3m 2013: 18.8m of loans denominated in foreign currency.
Liquidity risk The group monitors its liquidity risk using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the groups assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations.
Bank facilities, which allow for appropriate headroom in the groups daily cash movements, are then arranged.
Details of our bank facilities can be found in Note 24.
Strategic Report Governance Financial 111 25 Financial instruments The tables below summarise the maturity profile including both undiscounted interest and principal cash flows of the groups financial assets and liabilities: Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial assets at 31 March 2014 m m m m Trade receivables 252.8 252.8 Financing assets 0.9 21.0 21.9 89.1 89.1 Cash and cash equivalents 342.8 21.0 363.8 Financial assets Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial assets at 31 March 2013 m m m m Trade receivables 274.3 274.3 Financing assets 0.8 26.2 27.0 Cash and cash equivalents 90.8 90.8 Financial assets 365.9 26.2 392.1 Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial liabilities at 31 March 2014 m m m m 186.9 186.9 Trade creditors 12.8 115.3 216.7 344.8 Financing liabilities Deferred contingent consideration 1.3 6.5 7.8 Financial liabilities 201.0 121.8 216.7 539.5 Within In the second After one year to fifth years five years Total Financial liabilities at 31 March 2013 m m m m Trade creditors 210.7 210.7 Financing liabilities 12.5 122.6 226.1 361.2 Deferred contingent consideration 8.0 8.0 Financial liabilities 223.2 130.6 226.1 579.9 Credit risk The groups credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally reported quarterly.
The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis.
The groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and are managed through regular review.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in relation to the groups trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Before accepting a new customer, the group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customers credit quality and define an appropriate credit limit which is reviewed regularly.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers the credit quality of the counterparty.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts at the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables.
The groups customer base is large and unrelated and, accordingly, the group does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any one counterparty or group of counterparties.
Mitie Group plc 112 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 25 Financial instruments Capital management risk The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the group consists of net debt per Note 28 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The groups capital structure is reviewed regularly.
The group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements with the exception of those applicable to the groups captive insurance subsidiary, which is monitored on a regular basis.
Hedging activities Cash flow hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Bi-annual fixed interest cash flows arising over the periods to December 2022 and denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
The group also holds a number of forward exchange currency contracts designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.
All cash flow hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2014.
Fair value hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for floating interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
All fair value hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2014.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Included in bank loans at 31 March 2014 was a borrowing of 9.5m 2013: 9.5m which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Republic of Ireland business of Dalkia FM in Ireland and is being used to hedge the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Gains or losses on the translation of the borrowing are transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on the translation of the net investment.
Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date were as follows: Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 0.8 9.7 0.4 Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges 3.2 0.6 Derivative financial instruments hedging private placement notes 4.0 10.3 0.4 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2 and deferred contingent consideration falls into Level 3.
Deferred contingent consideration is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation based on the attainment of certain profit targets.
In assessing the likely future obligation, the directors have used their experience and knowledge of market conditions, alongside internal business plans and growth forecasts.
Actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of 7.8m 2013: 8.0m dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses.
Movements in the carrying value of deferred contingent consideration are shown in Note 26.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

31 Acquisitions During the year a net cash outflow of 10.7m arose on the acquisitions set out below: m UK CRBs Limited 0.9 Complete Care Holdings Limited 8.8 Non-controlling interests 0.8 Other 0.2 10.7 Net cash outflow on acquisitions Current year acquisitions Entities acquired during the year contributed 5.8m to revenue and 0.4m to the groups headline operating profit for the period.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the start of the period, the groups headline revenue and operating profit would have been approximately 2,158m and 128m respectively.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the underlying profitability of the companies in the acquired group, expected profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from assimilation into Mitie.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008 requires transactions with non-controlling interests to be accounted for within equity.
As a result, the difference of 5.8m between the consideration paid for the purchase of non-controlling interests during the year and the change in non-controlling interests is recognised in retained earnings.
Prior to adoption of the revised standard in the year ended 31 March 2011 these amounts would have been recognised in goodwill.
Purchase of Complete Care Holdings Limited On 15 January 2014, Mitie acquired the high acuity care provider Complete Care Holdings Limited Complete Group for a total consideration of 9.0m.
The transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 2008.

Prior year acquisitions The provisional acquisition accounting for prior year acquisitions as disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts was reviewed during the period resulting in a reduction of the fair value of net assets acquired of 5.5m, an increase in non-controlling interests of 0.4m and an increase of goodwill of 5.1m.
These adjustments comprise an adjustment to estimates made at the end of the prior year and within a year from the date of acquisition in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The adjustments have not materially changed the net assets of the group and therefore the 2013 comparative information has not been restated.
The final information on prior year acquisitions is shown below.
Purchase of Enara Group Limited On 9 October 2012, Mitie acquired Enara Group Limited Enara, from August Equity LLP and Enara's senior management team, for a total consideration of 110.8m on a cash and debt free basis.

The initial consideration payable was 5.2m paid in cash on completion and 0.3m of deferred contingent consideration which was settled in cash in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The earn out of the remaining 49% stake will bring total consideration payable to a maximum of 12.0m, which is dependent on long-term performance.
Earn out deferred consideration of 6.5m is provided at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation, which in all likelihood will become payable up to 2017 subject to certain profit targets being attained.
This is recognised via equity and is included in Provisions in Note 26.

In the year ended 31 March 2014, options were granted in June, July and November 2013 in respect of the SAYE, LTIP and Executive Share Option schemes.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was 4.0m.
In the year ended 31 March 2013, options were granted in May, July and August in respect of the SAYE, LTIP and Executive share option schemes.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was 6.5m.
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2014 2013 Share price p 219-274 198274 Exercise price p 0-254 0254 Expected volatility % 3235 30-32 Expected life years 3-5 35 Risk-free rate % 0.55-1.48 0.552.42 Expected dividends % 3.5-4.1 3.304.10 Mitie Group plc 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2014 34 Share-based payments The inputs into the Monte Carlo model are as follows: 2014 2013 Share price p 251 Average correlation with TSR benchmark % 32 Expected volatility % 24 Expected life years 3 Risk-free rate % 0.64 Expected dividends % 4.1 Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes.
The expected life is based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on managements best estimates for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
35 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.
The group paid employer contributions of 10.4m 2013: 8.8m during the year.
As at 31 March 2014, contributions of 1.2m 2013: 0.7m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes Group defined benefit scheme The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the Mitie Group plc Pension Scheme where Mitie Group plc is the principal employer.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the group.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the group.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0% and 66% of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the group schemes assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations was carried out as at 1 April 2011 by Chris Vaughan-Williams, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, from Aon Hewitt Limited.
The next triennial valuation is due as at 1 April 2014.
This led to a reduction in the defined benefit pension deficit of 10.5m at the date when the plan amendment occurred and was accounted for as a negative past service cost in accordance with IAS 19.
Other defined benefit schemes Grouped together under Other schemes are a number of schemes to which the group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
For the Admitted Body Schemes, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts.
The group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess is recovered from the body that the employees transferred from.
In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the group will be required to pay any deficit as determined by the Scheme Actuary that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.
