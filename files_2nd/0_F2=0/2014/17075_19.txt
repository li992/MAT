Background to remuneration policy The Company has a well-established and clear remuneration policy which, in the view of the Committee, has made an important contribution to the success of the Company over a sustained period.
This can be summarised as providing at or below the median of market levels of fixed pay but with the opportunity to earn upper quartile levels of remuneration if the executives deliver superior returns for shareholders.
Executive remuneration packages are structured so that they: are aligned to the Companys strategy to promote its long-termsuccess: are aligned with the interests of shareholders: are competitive and provide a very clear bias to variable paywith stretching and rigorous performance measures andconditions: do not promote unacceptable behaviours or encourage unacceptable risk taking: and take into account Company-wide pay and employment conditions.
The Directors remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee presents the Directors remuneration policy, which will be put to a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 January 2015 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take immediate effect.
TheDirectors remuneration policy has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations.
Future policy table 3.1 Executive directors The following table explains the different elements of remuneration we pay to our executive directors: Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures Base salary This is the basic element While base salaries are reviewed each year, the Base salary is paid monthly in cash of pay and reflects the Companys policy is not automatically to award an Base salaries are reviewed annually with any individuals role and inflationary increase.
When reviewing salaries, the changes normally taking effect from 1 March position within the Group Committee takes into account a range of factors with some adjustment to including the Groups performance, market conditions, reflect their capability the prevailing market rates for similar positions in and contribution comparable companies, the responsibilities, individual performance and experience of each executive director and the level of salary increases awarded to employees throughout the Group Base salaries are benchmarked against both FTSE250 companies and other leading retailers.
While the Committee applies judgement rather than setting salaries by reference to a fixed percentile position, its general approach is to constrain base salaries to a median or lower level While the Committees general approach is to keep salaries to a relatively low level, and, in the normal course, would not expect salary increases to be higher than those for other head office staff, given the need for a formal cap, the Committee has limited the maximum salary which it may award to the median of salaries of CEOs in the top half of FTSE 250 companies even though, in practice, the Committee would normally seek to keep it below the median of this benchmark
