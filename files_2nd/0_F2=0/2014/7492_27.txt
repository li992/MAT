To assist with analysis and comparison, certain pro forma 52-week information has therefore been provided in respect of the Groups 2011 12 financial year to eliminate the distortion of a 53rd week on the performance of the Group.
In June 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 Employee Bene ts IAS 19 revised.
The revised standard is effective for the first time during the 52 weeks to 1 March 2014 and is required to be applied retrospectively.
There has been no change to the Group five-year summary as the adjustments to the income statement resulting from adoption of IAS 19 revised relate only to items previously excluded from the Groups reported benchmark pro t before tax.
There has been no change to the Groups net assets as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 revised, so no restatement of the balance sheet is required.
