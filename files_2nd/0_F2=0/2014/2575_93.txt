Loans and other borrowings Capital management policy The objective of the groups capital management policy is to reduce net debt over time whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, the group may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2013 14 and 2012 13.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 20.
The groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which the group manages as capital.
2014 2013 At 31 March m m Net debt 7,028 7,797 a Total parent shareholders deficit equity 610 276 6,418 7,521 a Excludes non-controlling interests of 18m 2012 13: 14m.
Loans and other borrowings continued Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to net debt is given below.

The fair value of listed bonds is 10,597m 2012 13 10,535m and the fair value of finance leases is 286m 2012 13 314m.
The fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings are estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with same maturities, where they exist and on calculation of the value of future cash ows using approximate discount rates in eect at the balance sheet date where market prices of similar issues do exist.
Loans and other borrowings continued The carrying amount of commercial paper, other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
