C redit risk Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and measure the credit risk of loans and advances to customers and banks at a counterparty level using three components: i the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations: ii the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default: and iii the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default.
The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales.
The Groups credit risk exposure, which arises wholly in the United Kingdom, is set out below.
i Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
Noaccount is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions, their contractual nominal amounts.
