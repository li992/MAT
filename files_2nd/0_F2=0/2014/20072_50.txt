ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PHOSPHATES estimates as at 31 December 2014 ANGLO AMERICAN FOSFATOS BRASIL LIMITADA The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Reserve Life is reported from 2014 onwards and is aligned with the current approved Life of Mine Plan.

Mining method: OP Open Pit.
Reserve Life The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Chapado Mine is the formal name of the Anglo American Fosfatos Brasil Limitada Phosphate mining operation near Ouvidor.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Chapado Oxide Ore Reserves: The decrease is due to production.
Chapado Oxide Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 6 %P O cut-off and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.5.
2 5 2 5 Coqueiros: The Oxide mineralisation is defined by a cut-off grade of 7 %P O and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
The Fresh Rock resources are 2 5 2 5 defined by a cut-off grade of 5 %P O.
The exploration drilling report submitted to Brazils Departamento Nacional fide Produo Mineral DNPM has been 2 5 approved with additional hydrogeological and geotechnical studies in progress.
Audits related to the generation of the Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2014 at Chapado.
