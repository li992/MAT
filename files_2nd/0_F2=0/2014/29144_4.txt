Scottish Mortgage discount after deducting borrowings at fair value NAV fair return Scottish Mortgage discount after deducting borrowings at par Share price return The premium discount is the difference between Scottish Mortgages quoted share price and its underlying net asset value calculated on one of two bases: Borrowings are either deducted at par redemption value or at fair value the current market worth.
As borrowings have a current market value above par, the effect of valuing the borrowings at fair value reduces both the NAV and resultant discount.
Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
