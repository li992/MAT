Accordingly the companys profits for this accounting period are taxed at the effective rate of 21.33% and will be taxed at 20% from 1 April 2015.
The companys taxable income is exceeded by its tax allowable expenses, which include both the revenue and capital elements of the management fee and finance costs.
As at 31 January 2015, the company had accumulated surplus expenses of 185.5 million 2014 - 172.5 million.
As at 31 January 2015 the company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 36.7 million 2014 - 34.5 million in respect of the accumulated expenses, based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 20% 2014 - 20%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 17 July 2013 and is effective from 1 April 2015.
Provided the company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that these expenses will be utilised and that the company will obtain any benefit from this asset.
The company will continue to seek approval under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 for the current year and the foreseeable future.
The company has not therefore provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposals of investments.
