Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Results Fair values for financial instruments The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1 - Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 - Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
At 31 August 2014, all financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, provisions and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value using level 2 observable inputs, except for contingent deferred consideration on acquisitions and redemption liability on acquisitions within provisions, which are measured using level 3 unobservable inputs.
For contingent deferred consideration on acquisitions, amounting to 2.5m, there are no changes in assumptions that would result in a significant change in the fair value since this comprises performance-related amounts for which the performance period was complete at the balance sheet date.
For redemption liability on acquisitions, amounting to 13.1m, the main assumptions are the projected future cash flows and the discount rate.
The effect of changes to these assumptions are as follows: Increase decrease liability Increase in Decrease in Change in assumption assumption assumption m m Projected cash flows 5.0% 0.1 0.1 Discount rate 1.0% 0.3 0.3 Movements in contingent deferred consideration on acquisitions, together with non-contingent amounts, and redemption liability on acquisitions are detailed in note 29.
Further disclosures in respect of the fair values for each financial instrument are found in the respective notes to the Group financial statements.
Trade and other payables 2014 2013 m m Current Trade payables 77.
146.5 6 Non-current Accruals and deferred income 0.
0.7 2 Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount and fair value of trade and other payables.
Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-retirement schemes for qualifying employees in operations around the world.
The schemes based in the UK and the Netherlands together account for 95% of total scheme assets and 96% of total scheme liabilities.
The assets of all the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The cost of all the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
UK scheme The Fenner Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit pension scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 1997.
Scheme members accrue an annual pension, being a proportion of final salary for each year of pensionable service, increasing in line with inflation whilst in payment, subject to certain caps.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The most recent triennial valuation, whilst yet to be formally completed, was carried out as at 31 March 2014.
The actuarial valuation was updated as at 31 August 2014 by an independent qualified actuary.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2014 99 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 27.
Post-retirement benefits continued The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
By funding the defined benefit scheme, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of funding its obligations is higher than anticipated.
This could arise due to a number of reasons, including: - the level of investment returns being lower than anticipated, especially if such reductions in asset values are not matched by falls in liabilities: - increases in the anticipated life expectancy of members, for example, due to continued improvements in healthcare: - increases in future inflation over anticipated levels, which would result in higher payments: and - changes in the legislative environment, resulting in an increase in liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the Fenner Pension Scheme liabilities is 14.5 years 2013: 15.0 years.
This can be subdivided into active members 19.7 years 2013: 19.8 years, deferred pensioners 19.4 years 2013: 17.6 years and pensions in payment 10.9 years 2013: 9.4 years.
Overseas schemes The principal overseas scheme is the Fenner Dunlop BV scheme, which is based in the Netherlands.
This is a career average pay scheme with indexation in line with the industry-wide pension fund.
The nominal benefits in this scheme are fully insured with registered insurance companies, which mitigates the downside risk to the Group.
The scheme is subject to annual actuarial valuations, carried out this year on 30 June 2014.
The weighted average duration of the Fenner Dunlop BV scheme liabilities is 20.1 years 2013: 20.2 years.
This can be subdivided into active members 23.6 years 2013: 24.2 years, deferred pensioners 25.5 years 2013: 24.8 years and pensions in payment 9.6 years 2013: 9.4 years.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities of the schemes are as follows: 2014 2013 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes Discount rate 3.8% 2.8% - 5.
4.3% 5% 2.0% - 4.5% Rate of increase in benefits in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation increases: - capped at 5.0% based on RPI 3.0% 3.1% - capped at 2.5% based on RPI 2.0% 2.1% - capped at 3.0% based on CPI 2.0% 2.2% The principal assumptions of the schemes are determined using appropriate expert advice and available market data.
The assumptions of the overseas schemes are given as a range of values in respect of the individual schemes.
The range of values is a consequence of the different territories in which the Group operates defined benefit schemes.
The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, with adjustments to reflect the schemes' actual mortality experience.
In respect of the Fenner Pension Scheme, the Group has used SAPS S2PA mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members, adjusted to reflect the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the CMI 2013 projections published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used with a minimum long-term rate of future annual mortality improvement of 1.25%.

Post-retirement benefits continued Sensitivity analysis Changes to the principal assumptions can have an effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation for 2014.
The effect of these changes are as follows: Decrease increase in retirement benefit obligations Increase in Decrease in Change in assumption assumption assumption m m Discount rate 1.0% 29.0 36.0 Inflation 1.0% 10.6 10.2 Life expectancy 1 ye 7.6 ar 7.8 The sensitivity analyses, with the exception of inflation, are based on a change in assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
For the inflation sensitivity, the assumptions for salary increases, increases to pensions in payment and the revaluation of deferred pension before retirement are appropriately adjusted in line with the inflation movement.
