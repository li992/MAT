Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the company only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The company manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below: Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the profit and loss account when the hedged cash flow impacts the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pensions The company participates in multi-employer pension schemes in the UK, which provide benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The company is unable to identify its share of the schemes assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.

The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company together with G4S International Finance plc hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 101m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 1m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps The company is exposed to interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
When fixed floating interest rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, interest rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend and meet Treasury policy, with the proportion of fixed interest rate held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as Treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
162 162 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements H Financial risk continued The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors preferring a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and the GBP public notes issued in May 2009, was initially kept at fixed rate.
In April 2014, the interest rate on 44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on all the GBP public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives.
The GBP public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade.
The core company borrowings are held in US dollar and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fixed rate loans some interest rate risk remains on the element swapped to floating.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2014 debt position constant throughout 2015, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 7m in the 2015 financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
The company acts as a market intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical terms with its subsidiaries to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
The company will no longer perform this market intermediary role from January 2015.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2014 the largest two counterparty exposures relating to treasury transactions were 33m and 20m and both were held with institutions with a long-term Standard & Poors credit rating of A.
These exposures represent 45% 2013: 42% and 27% 2013: 30% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2014.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
