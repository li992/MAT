FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in January 2009. a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical costconvention, except for the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and onthe assumption that approval as an investment trust continues to be granted by HM Revenue and Customs.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2015.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In light of their recommendation and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
Such adjustments would include expenses of reconstruction or liquidation along with any costs associated with realising the portfolio.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Overseas dividends are stated gross of withholding tax.
UK dividends are stated at the amount actually receivable, which is net of the attaching tax credit.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive a dividend as scrip dividend, that is in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the dividend foregone is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the dividend foregone is credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Derivative income from dividends on long Contracts For Difference CFDs is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement, with the exception of any performance fee which is charged wholly to the capital column, as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
e Taxation Irrecoverable overseas withholding tax suffered is recognised at the same time as the income to which it relates.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences, that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events have occurred that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of those transactions.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the capital column of the Income Statement.
g Valuation of investments This portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, and subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: and Unlisted investments, where there is not an active market, are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the Balance Sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 50.

Derivative instruments are held atfair value through profit or loss and are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: CFDs are valued at the difference between the strike price and the bid or last price of the underlying shares in the contract.
Gains and losses in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received or paid on derivative instruments is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Interest paid on long CFDs is charged to finance costs, in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on derivative instruments open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value either within current assets or creditors, as appropriate.
i Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Liquidity Fund plc, a short term money market fund investing in a diversified range of short term instruments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
j Capital reserve The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of the investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fees: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash at the Balance Sheet date, without accepting adverse terms, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
k Dividends In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.

This Note is incorporated in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 29 and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise long CFDs: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified by FRS 29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
MARKET PRICE RISK Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has a geared exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs which incur funding costs and provide collateral.
It is, therefore, exposed to afinancial risk as a result of increases in interest rates.
Interest rate risk profile The values of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 2014 2013 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Gearing effect of exposure through long CFDs 45,587 52,706 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Amounts held in margin accounts 607 Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc 4,038 31 Cash at bank 4,402 21,326 9,047 21,357 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 36,540 31,349 Foreign currency risk The Companys total net assets and its total return on ordinary activities can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency, which is UK sterling.
The Company is also subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences: and Movements in rates affecting income received.

TheBoard meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the other risk categories disclosed in this Note.
Derivative instruments are used by the Portfolio Manager to gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
The risk and performance contribution of the derivative instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist Derivative Instruments Team which draws on over forty years of experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Investment Manager on portfolio construction.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and long CFDs which, if necessary, can be sold easily to meet funding commitments.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.

In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs, the Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which it believes to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk through the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over The Counter OTC derivative transactions, in accordance with the terms of International Swap Dealers Association ISDA market standard derivative contracts, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 December 2014, 607,000 2013: nil was held in cash in a segregated collateral account, on behalf of the broker, to reduce the exposure to counterparty risk of the broker.
At 31 December 2013, 19,703,000 was held in government bonds in a segregated collateral account, on behalf of the Company, to reduce the exposure to counterparty risk of the Company.
CREDIT RISK Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that can be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and derivative instruments at fair value.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis If interest rates at 31 December 2014, had increased by 0.25%, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by 91,000 2013: 78,000.

Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in long CFDs to gain exposure to the equity markets.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Notes 1 g and 1 h on pages 45 and 46, investments are stated at fair value, which is bid or last market price, and long CFDsare stated at fair value, which is the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.
Other financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Under FRS 29 financial companies are required to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in Accounting Policies Notes 1 g and 1 h on pages 45 and 46.
Allthe financial instruments held at fair value by the Company at 31 December 2014 are considered to fall within Level 1, with the exception of net derivative instrument liabilities of 964,000 2013: derivative instrument assets of 19,980,000 which fall within Level 2.
