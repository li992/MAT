Discontinued operations, which comprise the results of Electroworld Turkey, Unieuro, PIXmania and Central Europe comprising Electroworld Czech Republic and Electroworld Slovakia are shown separately after post-tax results in accordance with IFRS 5 and are described further in note 8. ii Net restructuring charges strategic reorganisation: Year ended Year ended 30 April 2014 30 April 2013 Re-presented million million Asset impairments 8.7 5.6 Property charges 14.3 Other charges 4.9 8.7 24.8 Year ended 30 April 2014: Charges comprise asset impairments of other intangibles work in progress in respect of UK system costs which, following a revision in the Groups systems strategy as a result of the disposals of businesses which have occurred during the year have been concluded as no longer having value.
Year ended 30 April 2013: Charges related predominantly to the reorganisation of the remaining retained UK B2B operations following the sale of Equanet for which the charges were 22.9 million.
The charges related mainly to an onerous operating lease which was retained in respect of these sold operations together with related fixed asset write offs.

UK Riot related income comprises insurance recoveries in respect of charges incurred in 2011 12. v Loss on sale of business: Year ended 30 April 2013: On 28 March 2013, the Group completed the disposal of its Equanet B2B operations Equanet to Kelway UK Limited for consideration of 4.2 million.
The loss on disposal is analysed as follows: million Net assets disposed: Goodwill 10.7 Other assets 1.7 12.4 Loss on disposal 9.6 Consideration and costs 2.8 Consideration 4.2 Disposal fees and exit costs 1.4 Consideration and costs 2.8 As described in note i, above, the disposal did not satisfy the requirements of IFRS 5 for treatment as a discontinued operation and accordingly the loss on disposal has been included within continuing operations.
vi Net non-cash financing costs on defined benefit pension schemes: Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the net interest charge on defined benefit pension schemes is calculated by applying the corporate bond yield rates applicable on the last day of the previous financial year and to the net defined benefit liability.
Corporate bond yield rates vary over time which in turn creates volatility in the income statement and balance sheet and results in a non-cash remeasurement cost which can be volatile due to corporate bond yield rates prevailing on a particular day and is also unrepresentative of the actual investment gains or losses made or the liabilities paid and payable.
Consistent with a number of other companies, the accounting effects of these non-cash revaluations of net defined benefit pension liabilities have been excluded from underlying earnings.
Dixons Retail plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Enfocus Software - Customer Support Enfocus Software - Customer Support Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Non-underlying items continued vii Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements are prepared.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
viii Year ended 30 April 2014: On 19 May 2014, the Group signed a new revolving credit facility agreement the New Facility for 150 million.
The New Facility is described further in notes 17 and 32.
The New Facility replaced the pre-existing facility of 200 million and has triggered the acceleration of the amortisation of fees related to this facility which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the pre-existing facilitys maturity in June 2015 and which have therefore been charged in 2013 14.
Year ended 30 April 2013: On 20 September 2012, the Group repurchased 15.6 million in nominal amount of its 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds due November 2012 the 2012 Bonds as well as 49.4 million in nominal amount of its 8.75% Guaranteed Notes due August 2015 the 2015 Notes.
The latter repurchase was funded by part of a new issue of 150 million 8.75% Guaranteed Notes due September 2017 the 2017 Notes.
As a result of the repurchases of the 2012 Bonds and 2015 Notes, charges were incurred relating to the acceleration of the amortisation of fees from the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the 2012 Bonds maturity in November 2012 and the 2015 Notes maturity in August 2015, together with a redemption premium.
ix Other finance charges relate to onerous finance lease interest costs in respect of the reorganisation of the UK B2B operations which occurred in 2012 13 as described in ii.

Dixons Retail plc 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Enfocus Software - Customer Support Enfocus Software - Customer Support Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill continued b Impairment testing As required by IAS 36, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria: business acquisitions generate an attributed amount of goodwill: the manner in which these businesses are run and managed is used to determine the Cash Generating Unit CGU grouping as defined in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: the recoverable amount of each CGU group is determined based on calculating its value in use VIU : the VIU is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period: cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP : and the VIU is then compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The key assumptions used in calculating value in use are: managements five year projections: the growth rate beyond five years: and the pre-tax adjusted discount rate.
The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using risk adjusted strategic plans which have regard to the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with managements views on the future achievable growth in market share and impact of the committed initiatives.
The cash flows which derive from these five year projections include ongoing capital expenditure required to develop and upgrade the store network in order to maintain and operate the businesses and to compete in their markets.
In forming the five year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the five year projections comprise the growth in sales and costs over this period.
The compound annual growth rate in sales and costs can rise as well as fall year on year depending not only on the year five targets, but also on the current financial year base.
These targets, when combined, accordingly drive the resulting profit margins and the profit in year five of the projections which is in turn used to calculate the terminal value in the VIU calculation.
Historical amounts for the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
The growth rate beyond five years is based on the GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital having regard to the strategic five year plans themselves already being risk adjusted to take account of specific risks in the relevant market or region.
The Groups only goodwill balance is in respect of Elkjp and the values attributed to these assumptions are as follows: 2014 2013 Compound annual growth in sales 6.1% 6.6% Compound annual growth in costs 6.0% 6.6% Growth rate beyond five years 2.4% 2.5% Pre-tax discount rate 11.2% 10.7% c Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held constant.
Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumption which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordics division, the Group operates small funded secured defined benefit pension schemes, which are also closed to future accrual, with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to state pension schemes.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 0.5 million 2012 13 0.9 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
In Greece, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are governed by statute.

A recovery plan based on this valuation, agreed with the trustee, commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million, rising to 20.0 million for 2012 13 and 2013 14.
Contributions rise to 25.0 million for 2014 15 and will rise approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2013 is still underway and its results are expected within the first half of 2014 15.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 March 2010 were: Rate per annum Discount rate for accrued benefits Pre-retirement 6.4% Post-retirement 5.1% 5.3% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 0% 2.8% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.4% 4.1% Inflation 3.7% At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
c UK Defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net defined benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and other amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the independent actuaries.
2014 2013 Rates per annum Discount rate 4.4% 4.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions pre post April 2006 accrual 3.0% 2.0% 3.2% 2.1% Inflation 3.3% 3.3% The Group uses demographic assumptions underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2010 In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables S1 All Pensioners tables published by the CMI, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS from 2000 to 2006 with medium cohort improvements up to 2009 and multipliers of 105% for males and 110% for females.
In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity by using the new CMI 2009 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.0% per annum for women.
Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 87.2 years and 88.9 years for men and between 88.3 years and 89.5 years for women 2013 between 87.2 years and 88.8 years for men and between 88.6 years and 89.7 years for women for those reaching 65 over the next 15 years.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2012 13 income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables if applied to the current year consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
Net finance costs Net deficit 2013 14 2012 13 2014 2013 Restated million million million million Positive negative effect Discount rate: 0.25% increase 1.7 1.3 59.5 62.5 Inflation rate: 0.25% increase 2.1 2.4 46.6 53.5 Mortality rate: 1 year increase 1.6 1.4 35.5 36.2 The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
d Other post-employment benefits IAS 19 The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas territories, in particular in Greece.
At 30 April 2014 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was 3.0 million 2013 12.6 million.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 0.5 million 2012 13 1.5 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the year, actuarial gains losses, amounts in respect of discontinued operations and currency retranslation.
22 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies Treasury operations are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board and are subject to periodic independent internal and external reviews.
Group Treasury reports regularly to the Tax & Treasury Committee and as required, to the Board.
The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to market risks movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Areas where risks are most likely to occur are evaluated regularly.
The Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.
Throughout the year under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 1.16.
Exchange rate risk The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and translated values of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups principal translation currency exposures are the euro, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, the Groups policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with related currency costs and currency assets with currency liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from purchases in currencies other than in the functional currency of the entity.
The Groups principal transactional currency exposures are the US dollar and euro.
It is Group policy to minimise the currency exposures on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging instruments such as forward exchange contracts.
Such contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of sterling cash, investments and sterling borrowings.
Potential exposure to interest rate movements is mitigated by the Groups policy to match to the extent possible the profile of interest payments with that of its interest receipts.
Liquidity risk It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short term and long term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group Treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.
Dixons Retail plc 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Enfocus Software - Customer Support Enfocus Software - Customer Support Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, investments mainly bank deposits and floating rate notes and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of non-performance of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through application of Group Treasury policy which limit the credit exposure to counterparties with a Moodys long term credit rating below A1, bank financial strength rating below C and short term credit rating below P2.
The Group also has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.
The Group continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk given the policies in place.
The Groups receivable balances comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited and maximum exposure is equal to the book value of receivables.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Capital risk management It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios which it met throughout the year.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has approval responsibility for: Group long term and budgeted capital spend, setting capital assessment criteria, new store capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business acquisitions, business disposals and contingent liabilities such as guarantees.
The Committee also approves routine statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are distributed to shareholders by assessing the performance of the business, the level of available net funds and the short to medium term strategic plans concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
Such assessment will influence the level of dividends payable as well as consideration from time to time of market purchases of the Groups own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis and this is affected by Free Cash Flow which is defined on the face of the cash flow statement and is one of the Groups key performance indicators.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note 22 d. The fair value of the 2015 Notes is 109.9 million 2013 112.4 million.
The 2015 Notes are carried at amortised cost.
Excluded from the fair value is 2.1 million 2013 2.2 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
The fair value of the 2017 Notes is 174.8 million 2013 169.1 million.
The 2017 Notes are carried at amortised cost.
Excluded from the fair value is 1.6 million 2013 1.6 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
Fair value of derivatives is predominantly determined using observable market data such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
As such, derivatives are classified as Level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.

c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies predominantly by entering into forward and swap foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses forwards and swaps to manage its foreign exchange translation exposure.
The Group has designated financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Fair value hedges During 2012 13, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of 250 million whereby the Group received a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and paid a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and which matured in November 2012.
The Group designated 125 million as fair value hedges for the 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds 2012 the 2012 Bonds which had the same critical terms.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 2.4 million was recognised in the income statement offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the 2012 Bonds.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 0.2 million was recorded in the income statement.
The Group held the remaining 125 million of these swaps to act as an economic hedge for the 2015 Notes until August 2012.
These swaps were not designated as hedges under IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges At 30 April 2014 the Group had forward and swap foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 498.9 million 2013 381.3 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The fair value movement on these currency derivatives which has been taken to equity in the year amounts to a 10.5 million gain 2012 13 12.7 million loss.
In respect of contracts which matured during the year, gains of 15.1 million and losses of 10.1 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2012 13 losses of 5.4 million and losses of 3.4 million.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2012 13 nil.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations During 2012 13, the Group held forward foreign exchange contracts which, combined with cross currency swaps, acted as a hedge against 100 million of euro denominated net investments in foreign operations.
These contracts mature in November 2012 and gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives were transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement.

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based either on daily bank deposit rates or central bank lending rates.
Fixed rate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are predominantly money market deposits as shown in note 16 and earn interest at an average effective rate of 0.40% 2013 0.42%.
Floating rate borrowings in 2013 comprised bank overdrafts.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximated 5.7%.
Until November 2012, the Group held interest rate swaps with a nominal value of 250 million.
During the period to maturity of these swaps, the Group received a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and paid floating rates of LIBOR plus margins which ranged from 1.68% to 2.37%.
The Groups currency swaps had a nominal value of 200 million, which also matured in November 2012, and received LIBOR plus a margin and paid EURIBOR plus a margin.
During the period to maturity of these swaps, the sterling floating rates ranged from 1.58% to 2.06% and the euro floating rates ranged from 1.31% to 2.14% Amounts in respect of other currencies relate to funds held within subsidiary companies operating in the Nordics and Central Europe.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Dixons Retail plc 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 14 Enfocus Software - Customer Support Enfocus Software - Customer Support Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below.
As a consequence, the sensitivity reflects the position as at 30 April 2014 and 30 April 2013, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies of US dollar, euro, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone with other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.

The Groups principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The numbers below show the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant.
A 1% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would increase profit before tax and equity by 1.2 million 2012 13 a 0.5 million decrease in profit before tax and equity.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: The balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year.
All cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective.
Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.

The Group reviews regularly its available cash resources and undrawn committed borrowing facilities required to fulfil its objectives and strategy.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared covering a five year period and these are updated annually.
Shorter term forecasts are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis in varying degrees of granularity including, in some cases, daily review.
These forecasts are used in determining both the level of borrowings required for funding purposes as well as planning for repayments of borrowings either at their maturity or sooner where practical.
An appropriate level of headroom is maintained to provide against unexpected outflows or an unforeseen downturn in trading.
Further details of committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 17.

a Equity settled Share option plans Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS and Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Options have historically been granted to executive directors and other employees on the basis of management grade.
In September 2008, the Group adopted a new share option plan ESOP which replaced the existing scheme ESOS.
Options granted after this date have only been granted under the new ESOP.
The ESOS and ESOP permit making awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipients salary and three times in exceptional circumstances.
Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three year period, unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Depending on grade, vesting may also be dependent on various performance measures as agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant.
For options granted in 2012 13, vesting is also dependent on the level of EPS achieved at the end of a three year period.
Options are generally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Options issued under this plan included Reward Sacrifice options offered to senior executives in September 2009 which did not have any performance conditions.
During the year, there were no new awards under this plan.
