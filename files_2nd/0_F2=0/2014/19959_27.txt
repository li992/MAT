Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards.
Change of GAAP For the period ending 1 January 2016, the Company intends to adopt FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Foreign currency translation The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for office equipment and 25% for computer equipment.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is amortised over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at the rate of 25%.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benefits The Company and other UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts.
These plans are operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are defined contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises.
Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Pension plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Companys unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged against operating profit.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The last equity settled grant under the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS was during 2013, with no award being made in the current year.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The changes to the LTIP which took effect in 2014 are summarised in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 91.
The previously granted equity settled incentives under the EBS were determined as a percentage of the annual bonus and were matched by the Group with a share award that would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the individual continued to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continued to be employed by the company at the date of vesting.
In addition the EBS included a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS was determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards granted.
The fair value was determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 171 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets & liabilities The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and short-term deposits.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS 26 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS 26 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as a cash flow hedge or fair value hedge.
To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Profit attributable to the Company The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 243.5m 2013: 24.3m.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.
Dividends paid & proposed 2014 2013 m m Declared & paid during the period Equity dividends on ordinary shares Final dividend for 2013: 33.2p 2012: 30.0p 70.7 63.8 Interim dividend for 2014: 15.0p 2013: 8.8p 32.0 18.8 102.7 82.6 Proposed for approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting Final dividend for 2014: 29.0p 2013: 33.2p 61.9 70.8 The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares held, at the date the financial statements were approved and authorised for issue.
The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of the report and financial statements and the record date for the final dividend.
Directors Details of directors remuneration, benefits and LTIP awards are included in the Remuneration report on pages 91 to 108, and in note 29 to the Group financial statements.

These defined benefit plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
In accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were defined contribution plans.
While assets and liabilities in respect of these plans are not reflected on the Companys balance sheet, details of these are set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group made special contributions of 10.6m in 2014 2013: 12.1m in addition to the Groups regular contributions.
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2011, when the funding shortfall was 81.4m.
The deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustees at that time was for the Company to make recovery contributions of 8.0m per annum up to 2020, subject to reassessment at future triennial valuations.
The next funding valuation of the Main Plan, as at 31 December 2014, is currently on-going.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of 10.6m with agreed recovery contributions of 2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017, also subject to reassessment at future triennial valuations.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.
The actual return on plan assets in the year was a gain of 83.2m 2013: 46.7m.
The assets and liabilities of the plans and the long-term expected rates of return are as follows.

This decision was announced to members in August 2013, at which point the curtailment gain was recognised under FRS 17.

Contingent liabilities & legal claims Guarantees The Company has given guarantees in relation to the bank and other borrowings of certain subsidiary companies.
The net funds of the companies party to these facilities as at 2 January 2015 amounted to 203.0m 2013: 134.1m.
Legal claims The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
A claim has been made by Philippines Gold Processing & Refining Corporation against Weir Services Australia Pty Limited WSA, a subsidiary of the Company, in arbitration proceedings in respect of two contracts relating to the refurbishment and installation of a mill undertaken by WSA in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, respectively.
The amount claimed, which totals approximately 58m plus interest, seeks damages for the cost of repair and subsequent replacement of the mill together with business interruption loss at the processing plant.
The original value of the contracts was around 1m.
WSA is contesting the claim on multiple grounds.
The claim is being vigorously defended although the outcome remains uncertain.
The arbitration process is expected to conclude by the end of 2015.
The Directors are of the view that the outcome of legal proceedings in 2014 in relation to the UN Oil for Food programme are such that a contingent liability no longer exists in relation to this matter.
To the extent not already provided for, the Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
