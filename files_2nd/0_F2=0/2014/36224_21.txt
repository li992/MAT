2 The fair value adjustments are determined in accordance with the basis of preparation on page 35.
The fair value adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2013 include the pro forma impact for the 4 month period prior to acquisition.
These incorporate adjustments for depreciation, amortisation and onerous contracts, although the major impact is the reversal ofthe non-cash inventory uplift adjustment of $445 million.
Inventories held by Xstrata at the date of acquisition were required to be recognised at fair value under IFRS.
This results in negligible margins upon the subsequent sale of these inventories.
The income impact of fair value uplift on inventory has been excluded from the pro forma financial information toaccurately present the underlying operating margins and provide more useful information about the performance of the Group.
