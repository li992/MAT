Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group from its liability to its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements for the purpose of managing its loss exposure.
The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies.
Of the reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities balance of 7,167 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 6,838 million, 93 per cent 2013: 96 per cent were ceded by the Groups UK and US operations, of which 95 per cent 2013: 93 per cent of the balance were from reinsurers with Standard & Poors rating Aand above.
The reinsurance asset for Jackson as shown in the table above primarily relates to certain fully collateralised former REALIC business retained by Swiss Re through 100 per cent reinsurance agreements.
Apart from the reinsurance of REALIC business, the principal reinsurance ceded by Jackson outside the Group is on term life insurance, direct and assumed accident and health business and GMIB variable annuity guarantees.
Net commissions received on ceded business and claims incurred ceded to external reinsurers totalled 35 million and 265 million respectively during 2014 2013: 37 million and 278 million respectively.
There were no deferred gains or losses on reinsurance contracts in either 2014 or 2013.
The Groups Asia and UK businesses do not cede significant amounts of business outside the Group.
In each of 2014 and 2013, the Groups UK insurance business wrote a longevity swap on certain aspects of the UKs annuity back-book liabilities.
This resulted in a one-off benefit of 30 million 2013: 27 million to IFRS profit before tax.
The gains and losses recognised in profit and loss for the other reinsurance contracts written in the year were immaterial.

212 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C4:  C4.2  a Asia Features of products and guarantees The life insurance products offered by the Groups Asia operations include a range of with-profits and non-participating term, whole life, endowment and unit-linked policies.
The Asia operations also offer health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage to supplement its core life products.
The terms and conditions of the contracts written by the Asia operations and, in particular, the products options and guarantees, vary from territory to territory depending upon local market circumstances.
In general terms, the Asia participating products provide savings and protection where the basic sum assured can be enhanced by a profit share or bonus from the underlying fund as determined at the discretion of the insurers.
The Asia operations non-participating term, whole life and endowment products offer savings and or protection where the benefits are guaranteed, or determined by a set of defined market-related parameters.
Unit-linked products combine savings with protection, the cash value of the policy depends on the value of the underlying unitised funds.
Health and Protection policies provide mortality or morbidity benefits and include health, disability, critical illness and accident coverage.
Health and Protection products are commonly offered as supplements to main life policies but can be sold separately.
Product guarantees in Asia can be broadly classified into four main categories, namely premium rate, cash value or interest rate guarantees, policy renewability, and convertibility options.
Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described in note C4.2 c in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
Non-participating long-term products are the only ones where the Group is contractually obliged to provide guarantees on all benefits.
Unit-linked products have the lowest level of guarantee.
The risks on death coverage through premium rate guarantees are low due to the diversified nature of the business as well as rigorous product pricing.
Cash value and interest rate guarantees are of three types: Types Features Maturityvalues Maturity values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
Declared regular bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Future bonus rates and cash dividends are not guaranteed on participating products.
Surrendervalues Surrender values are guaranteed for non-participating products and on the guaranteed portion of participating products.
The surrender value of declared reversionary bonuses are also guaranteed once vested.
Market value adjustments and surrender penalties are used for certain products and where the law permits such adjustments in cash values.
 It is common in Asia for regulations or market-driven demand and competition to provide some form of capital value protection and minimum crediting interest rate guarantees.
This would be reflected within the guaranteed maturity and surrender values.
The guarantees are borne by shareholders for non-participating and investment-linked non-investment guarantees only products.
Participating product guarantees are predominantly supported by the segregated life funds and their estates.
Whole of life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions are written in the Korea life operations though this is not to a significant extent as Korea has a much higher proportion of linked and health business.
The Korea business has non-linked liabilities and linked liabilities at 31 December 2014 of 596 million and 2,109 million respectively 2013: 547 million and 1,905 million respectively.
Determining contract liabilities For the with-profits business, the total value of the with-profits funds is driven by the underlying asset valuation with movements reflected principally in the accounting value of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
Similarly, for the unit-linked business, the attaching liabilities reflect the unit value obligation driven by the value of the investments of the unit fund.
For the shareholder-backed non-linked business, the future policyholder benefit provisions for Asia businesses in the Groups IFRS accounts, are determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis or where local GAAP is not well established and in which the business written is primarily non-participating and linked business, US GAAP principles are used as the most appropriate reporting basis.
For the countries which apply local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with modified statutory basis, the approach to determining the contract liabilities is driven by the local solvency basis.
A gross premium valuation method is used in those countries where a Risk-Based Capital framework is adopted for local solvency.
Under the gross premium valuation method, all cash flows are valued explicitly using best estimate assumptions.
A Risk-Based Capital framework applying the gross premium valuation method is adopted by Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and from 2013, Indonesia.
In applying this approach, an overlay constraint to the method is applied such that no negative reserves are derived at an individual policyholder level.
In Vietnam, the Company uses an estimation basis aligned substantially to that used by the countries applying the gross premium valuation method.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 213 For India, Japan and Taiwan, US GAAP is applied for measuring insurance assets and liabilities.
For these countries, the future policyholder benefit provisions for non-linked business are determined using the net level premium method, with an allowance for surrenders, maintenance and claims expenses.
Rates of interest used in establishing the policyholder benefit provisions vary by operation depending on the circumstances attaching to each block of business.
The other Asia operations principally adopt a net premium valuation method to determine the future policyholder benefit provisions.
The effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities for Asia insurance operations is as disclosed in note B4 a. b US Features of products and guarantees Jackson provides long-term savings and retirement products to retail and institutional customers throughout the US and offers the products discussed below: i Fixed annuities Fixed interest rate annuities At 31 December 2014, fixed interest rate annuities accounted for 9 per cent 2013: 10 per cent of policy and contract liabilities of Jackson.
Fixed interest rate annuities are primarily deferred annuity products that are used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and for providing income in retirement.
They permit tax-deferred accumulation of funds and flexible payout options.
The policyholder of a fixed interest rate annuity pays Jackson a premium, which is credited to the policyholders account.
Periodically, interest is credited to the policyholders account and in some cases administrative charges are deducted from the policyholders account.
Jackson makes benefit payments at a future date as specified in the policy based on the value of the policyholders account at that date.
The policy provides that at Jacksons discretion it may reset the interest rate, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson had fixed interest rate annuities totalling 11.7 billion 2013: 11.2 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.03 per cent average guaranteed rate 2013: 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and a 3.05 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Approximately 57 per cent 2013: 50 per cent of the fixed interest rate annuities Jackson wrote in 2014 provide for a market value adjustment MVA, that could be positive or negative, on surrenders in the surrender period of the policy.
This formula-based adjustment approximates the change in value that assets supporting the product would realise as interest rates move up or down.
The minimum guaranteed rate is not affected by this adjustment.
While the MVA feature minimises the surrender risk associated with certain fixed annuities, Jackson still bears a portion of the surrender risk on policies without this feature, and the investment risk on all fixed interest rate annuities.
Fixed index annuities Fixed index annuities accounted for 6 per cent 2013: 7 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2014.
Fixed index annuities vary in structure, but generally are deferred annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return based on participation rates and caps, and provide a guaranteed minimum return.
These guaranteed minimum rates are generally set at 1.0 to 3.0 per cent.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson had fixed index annuities allocated to indexed funds totalling 6.3 billion 2013: 6.1 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates on index accounts ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.83 per cent average guaranteed rate 2013: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.85 per cent average guarantee rate.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson also offers fixed interest accounts on some fixed index annuity products.
At 31 December 2014, fixed interest accounts of fixed index annuities totalled 1.8 billion 2013: 1.5 billion in account value with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.53 per cent average guaranteed rate 2013: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 2.56 per cent average guaranteed rate.
Jackson hedges the equity return risk on fixed index products using futures and options linked to the relevant index as well as through offsetting equity exposure in the variable annuity product.
The cost of these hedges is taken into account in setting the index participation rates or caps.
Jackson bears the investment risk and a portion of the surrender risk on these products.
Immediate annuities At 31 December 2014, immediate annuities accounted for 1 per cent 2013: 1 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Immediate annuities guarantee a series of payments beginning within a year of purchase and continuing over either a fixed period of years and or the life of the policyholder.
If the term is for the life of the policyholder, then Jacksons primary risks are mortality and reinvestment.
The implicit interest rate on these products is based on the market conditions that exist at the time the policy is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity.
ii Variable annuities At 31 December 2014, variable annuities accounted for 69 per cent 2013: 65 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities.
Variable annuities are deferred annuities that have the same tax advantages and payout options as fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities.
They are also used for asset accumulation in retirement planning and to provide income in retirement.
The primary differences between variable annuities and fixed interest rate or fixed index annuities are investment risk and return.
If a policyholder chooses a variable annuity, the rate of return depends upon the performance of the selected fund portfolio.
Policyholders may allocate their investment to either the fixed account or a selection of variable accounts.
Investment risk on the variable account is borne by the policyholder, while investment risk on the fixed account is borne by Jackson through guaranteed minimum fixed rates of return.
At 31 December 2014, 5 per cent 2013: 6 per cent of variable annuity funds were in fixed accounts.
Jackson had variable annuity funds in fixed accounts totalling 4.4 billion 2013: 4.2 billion with minimum guaranteed rates ranging from 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.81 per cent average guaranteed rate 2013: 1.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent and a 1.85 per cent average guaranteed rate.
214 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C4:  Jackson issues variable annuity contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contractholder either a a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals, b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB, at annuitisation guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB, at specified dates during the accumulation period guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB or at the end of a specified period guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB.
Jackson hedges these risks using equity options and futures contracts as described in note C7.3.
The GMAB and GMIB are no longer offered, with the existing GMIB coverage being substantially reinsured.
Jackson launched Elite Access in March 2012.
Elite Access is a variable annuity which has no guaranteed benefits and provides tax efficient access to alternative investments.
At 31 December 2014, Jackson had in force Elite Access variable annuity contracts with liability balance of 6.8 billion 2013: 3.4 billion.
iii Life insurance Life insurance products accounted for 12 per cent 2013: 14 per cent of Jacksons policy and contract liabilities at 31 December 2014.
Jackson discontinued new sales of life insurance products effective 1 August 2012.
Life products include term life and interest-sensitive life universal life and variable universal life.
Term life provides protection for a defined period and a benefit that is payable to a designated beneficiary upon death of the insured.
Universal life provides permanent individual life insurance for the life of the insured and includes a savings element.
Variable universal life is a type of life insurance policy that combines death benefit protection with the ability for the policyholder account to be invested in separate account funds.
For certain fixed universal life plans, additional provisions are held to reflect the existence of guarantees offered in the past that are no longer supported by earnings on the existing asset portfolio, or for situations where future mortality charges are not expected to be sufficient to provide for future mortality costs.
Excluding the business that is subject to the retrocession treaties at 31 December 2014, Jackson had interest sensitive life business in force with total account value of 5.9 billion 2013: 5.7 billion, with minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.65 per cent average guaranteed rate 2013: 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent with a 4.65 per cent average guaranteed rate.
iv Institutional products Jacksons institutional products consist of traditional guaranteed investment contracts GICs, funding agreements including agreements issued in conjunction with Jacksons participation in the US Federal Home Loan Bank programme and Medium Term Note funding agreements.
At 31 December 2014, institutional products accounted for 3 per cent of policy and contract liabilities 2013: 3 per cent.
Under a traditional GIC, the policyholder makes a lump sum deposit.
The interest rate paid is fixed and established when the contract is issued.
If deposited funds are withdrawn earlier than the specified term of the contract, an adjustment is made that approximates a market value adjustment.
Under a funding agreement, the policyholder either makes a lump sum deposit or makes specified periodic deposits.
Jackson agrees to pay a rate of interest, which may be fixed but is usually a floating short-term interest rate linked to an external index.
The average term of the funding agreements is one to two years.
In 2014 and 2013, there were no funding agreements terminable by the policyholder with less than 90 days notice.
v Aggregate account values The table below shows the distribution of account values for fixed annuities fixed interest rate and fixed index, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, and interest sensitive life business within the range of minimum guaranteed interest rates as described in notes i to iii above as at 31 December 2014 and 2013: Fixedannuitiesandthe fixedaccountportion Interestsensitive ofvariableannuities lifebusiness m m  2014 2013 2014 2013 1.00% 3,927 3,012 1.0% 2.0% 7,887 8,349 2.0% 3.0% 9,365 8,867 195 182 3.0% 4.0% 1,239 1,163 2,265 2,182 4.0% 5.0% 1,567 1,460 1,971 1,908 5.0% 207 197 1,514 1,456 Total 24,192 23,048 5,945 5,728 Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 215 Determining contract liabilities As permissible under IFRS 4 and consistent with the basis explained in note A3.1, in the case of Jackson the carrying values of insurance assets and liabilities are consolidated into the Group accounts based on US GAAP.
An overview of the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs for Jackson is provided in note C5.1 b.
With minor exceptions, all of Jacksons contracts are accounted for as investment contracts as defined for US GAAP purposes by applying in the first instance a retrospective deposit method to determine the liability for policyholder benefits.
This is then augmented by potentially three additional amounts, namely: Any amounts that have been assessed to compensate the insurer for services to be performed over future periods ie deferred income : Any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract: and Any probable future loss on the contract ie premium deficiency.
Capitalised acquisition costs and deferred income for these contracts are amortised over the life of the book of contracts.
The present value of the estimated gross profits is generally computed using the rate of interest that accrues to policyholder balances sometimes referred to as the contract rate.
Estimated gross profits include estimates of the elements, each of which will be determined based on the best estimate of amounts of the elements over the life of the book of contracts without provision for adverse deviation: Amounts expected to be assessed for mortality less benefit claims in excess of related policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed for contract administration less costs incurred for contract administration: Amounts expected to be earned from the investment of policyholder balances less interest credited to policyholder balances: Amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances upon termination of contracts sometimes referred to as surrender charges : and Other expected assessments and credits.
In the case of variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits as described above, liabilities for these benefits are accounted for under US GAAP and are valued as described below.
In accordance with US GAAP, the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and the for life portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities are determined each period end by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognising the excess ratably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments.
At 31 December 2014, these liabilities were valued using a series of deterministic investment performance scenarios, a mean investment return of 7.4 per cent 2013: 7.4 per cent net of external fund management fees, and assumptions for lapse, mortality and expense that are similar to those used in amortising the capitalised acquisition costs.
The direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability is determined by estimating the expected value of the annuitisation benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date of annuitisation and recognising the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments.
The assumptions used for calculating the direct Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability at 31 December 2014 and 2013 are consistent with those used for calculating the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit liabilities.
Jackson regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for life liability balances, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits are essentially fully reinsured, subject to a modest deductible and annual claim limits.
As this reinsurance benefit is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39, and is therefore recognised at fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of short-term fluctuations.
The direct GMIB liability is not considered a derivative instrument under IAS 39 and, as such, an accounting difference arises from this one-sided mark to market.
Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit not for life features are considered to be embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Therefore, provisions for these benefits are recognised at fair value.
The change in these guaranteed benefit reserves, along with claim payments and associated fees included in reserves are included along with the hedge results in short-term fluctuations, resulting in removal of the market impact from the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
For Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance embedded derivatives that are fair valued under IAS 39, Jackson bases its volatility assumptions on implied market volatility for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years period, where sufficient market liquidity is assumed to exist, followed by grading to long-term historical volatility levels beyond that point, where such long-term historical volatility levels contain an explicit margin for conservatism.
Non-performance risk is incorporated into the calculation through the use of discount interest rates sourced from an AA corporate credit curve as a proxy for Jacksons own credit risk.
Other risk margins, particularly for policyholder behaviour and long-term volatility, are also incorporated into the model through the use of explicitly conservative assumptions.
On a periodic basis, Jackson validates the resulting fair values based on comparisons to other models and market movements.
With the exception of the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit, Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit features of variable annuity contracts, the financial guarantee features of Jacksons contracts are in most circumstances not explicitly valued, but the impact of any interest guarantees would be reflected as they are earned in the current account value ie the US GAAP liability.
For traditional life insurance contracts, provisions for future policy benefits are determined under US GAAP using the net level premium method and assumptions as of the issue date as to mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses plus provisions for adverse deviation.
Institutional products are accounted for as investment contracts under IFRS with the liability classified as being in respect of financial instruments rather than insurance contracts, as defined by IFRS 4.
In practice there is no material difference between the IFRS and US GAAP basis of recognition and measurement for these contracts.
216 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C4:  Certain institutional products representing obligations issued in currencies other than US dollars have been hedged for changes in exchange rates using cross-currency swaps.
The fair value of derivatives embedded in funding agreements, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, are included in the carrying value of the trust instruments supported by funding agreements recorded in other non-insurance liabilities.
The effect of any non-recurrent changes of assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities of Jackson is shown in note B4 b. c UK Features of products and guarantees Prudentials long-term products in the UK consist of life insurance, pension products and pension annuities.
These products are written primarily in: One of three separate sub-funds of the PAC long-term fund, namely the with-profits sub-fund WPSF, Scottish Amicable Insurance Funds SAIF, and the non-profit sub-fund: Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL, a shareholder-owned subsidiary: or Other shareholder-backed subsidiaries writing mainly non-profit unit-linked business.
i With-profits products and PAC with-profits sub-fund The WPSF mainly contains with-profits business but it also contains some non-profit business unit-linked, term assurances and annuities.
The WPSFs profits are apportioned 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution is determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
In October 2014, the long-term business of Prudential Annuities Limited PAL was transferred into the WPSF following a Part VII transfer under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
The WPSF held a provision of 50 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 36 million to honour guarantees on a small amount of guaranteed annuity products.
SAIFs exposure to guaranteed annuities is described below.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: regular and final.
Regular bonuses are declared once a year, and once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike regular bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The main factors that influence the determination of bonus rates are the return on the investments of the with-profits fund, inflation, taxation, the expenses of the fund chargeable to policyholders and the degree to which investment returns are smoothed.
The overall rate of return earned on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences on bonus rates.
A high proportion of the assets backing the with-profits business are invested in equities and real estate.
If the financial strength of the with-profits business is affected, then a higher proportion of fixed interest or similar assets might be held by the fund.
Further details on the determination of the two types of the bonuses: regular and final are provided below.
Regular bonus rates For regular bonuses, the bonus rates are determined for each type of policy primarily by targeting the bonus level at a prudent proportion of the long-term expected future investment return on underlying assets.
The expected future investment return is reduced as appropriate for each type of policy to allow for items such as expenses, charges, tax and shareholders transfers.
However, the rates declared may differ by product type, or by the date of payment of the premium, or date of issue of the policy, or if the accumulated regular bonuses are particularly high or low, relative to a prudent proportion of the achieved investment return.
When target bonus levels change the PAC Board of directors has regard to the overall strength of the long-term fund when determining the length of time over which it will seek to achieve the amended prudent target bonus level.
In normal investment conditions, PAC expects changes in regular bonus rates to be gradual over time.
However, PAC retains the discretion whether or not to declare a regular bonus each year, and there is no limit on the amount by which regular bonus rates can change.
Final bonus rates A final bonus which is normally declared yearly, may be added when a claim is paid or when units of a unitised product are realised.
The rates of final bonus usually vary by type of policy and by reference to the period, usually a year, in which the policy commences or each premium is paid.
These rates are determined by reference to the asset shares for the sample policies but subject to the smoothing approach as explained below.
In general, the same final bonus scale applies to maturity, death and surrender claims except that: The total surrender value may be impacted by the application of a Market Value Reduction for accumulating with-profits policies and by the surrender bases for conventional with-profits business: and For the SAIF and Scottish Amicable, the final bonus rates applicable on surrender may be adjusted to reflect expected future bonus rates.
Application of significant judgement The application of the above method for determining bonuses requires the PAC Board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Prudential is required by UK law and regulation to consider the fair treatment of its customers in setting bonus levels.
The concept of determining what constitutes fair treatment, while established by statute, is not defined: Smoothing of investment returns: This is an important feature of with-profits products.
Determining when particular circumstances, such as a significant rise or fall in market values, warrant variations in the standard bonus smoothing limits that apply in normal circumstances requires the PAC Board of directors to exercise significant judgement: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive: The overall return to policyholders is an important competitive measure for attracting new business.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 217 Key assumptions As noted above, the overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its with-profits business as described above.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a with-profits business and is also consistent with the requirements of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their with-profits funds.
The principles contain an explanation of how it determines regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework that applies to all with-profits policies, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
Its purpose is therefore to: Explain the nature and extent of the discretion available: Show how competing or conflicting interests or expectations of different groups and generations of policyholders, and policyholders and shareholders are managed so that all policyholders and shareholders are treated fairly: and Provide a knowledgeable observer eg a financial adviser with an understanding of the material risks and rewards from starting and continuing to invest in a with-profits policy with Prudential.
Furthermore, in accordance with industry-wide regulatory requirements, the PAC Board has appointed: An Actuarial Function Holder who provides the PAC Board with all actuarial advice: A With-Profits Actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC Board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A With-Profits Committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
Smoothing of investment return In determining bonus rates for the UK with-profits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK with-profits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The smoothing approach differs between accumulating and conventional with-profits policies to reflect the different contract features.
In normal circumstances, Prudential does not expect most payout values on policies of the same duration to change by more than 10 per cent up or down from one year to the next, although some larger changes may occur to balance payout values between different policies.
Greater flexibility may be required in certain circumstances, for example following a significant rise or fall in market values, and in such situations the PAC Board may decide to vary the standard bonus smoothing limits in order to protect the overall interests of policyholders.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the PAC with-profits fund for each year presented.

Prudentials fixed-increase annuities incorporate automatic increases in annuity payments by fixed amounts over the policyholders life.
The RPI annuities that Prudential offers provide for a regular annuity payment to which an additional amount is added periodically based on the increase in the UK RPI.
Prudentials with-profits annuities, which are written in the WPSF, combine the income features of annuity products with the investment smoothing features of with-profits products and enable policyholders to obtain exposure to investment return on the WPSFs equity shares, property and other investment categories over time.
Policyholders select a required smoothed return bonus from the specific range Prudential offers for the particular product.
The amount of the annuity payment each year depends upon the relationship between the required smoothed return bonus rate selected by the policyholder when the product is purchased and the smoothed return bonus rates Prudential subsequently declares each year during the term of the product.
If the total bonus rates fall below the anticipated rate, then the annuity income falls.
iii SAIF SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund formed following the acquisition of the mutually owned Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997.
No new business may be written in SAIF, although regular premiums are still being paid on policies in force at the time of the acquisition and incremental premiums are permitted on these policies.
The fund is solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund although they are entitled to asset management fees on this business.
The process for determining policyholder bonuses of SAIF with-profits policies, which constitute the vast majority of obligations of the funds, is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
However, in addition, the surplus assets in SAIF are allocated to policies in an orderly and equitable distribution over time as enhancements to policyholder benefits ie in excess of those based on asset share.
Provision is made for the risks attaching to some SAIF unitised with-profits policies that have Market Value Reduction MVR-free dates and for those SAIF products which have a guaranteed minimum benefit on death or maturity of premiums accumulated at 4 per cent per annum.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuities in the UK is through SAIF and a provision of 549 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2014 2013: 328 million to honour the guarantees.
As SAIF is a separate sub-fund solely for the benefit of policyholders of SAIF, this provision has no impact on the financial position of the Groups shareholders equity.
iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business Prudential UK insurance operations also have an extensive book of unit-linked policies of varying types and provide a range of other non-profit business such as credit life and protection contracts.
These contracts do not contain significant financial guarantees.
There are no guaranteed maturity values or guaranteed annuity options on unit-linked policies except for minor amounts for certain policies linked to cash units within SAIF.
Determining contract liabilities i Overview The calculation of the contract liabilities involves the setting of assumptions for future experience.
This is done following detailed review of the relevant experience including in particular mortality, expenses, tax, economic assumptions and, where applicable, persistency.
For with-profits business written in the WPSF or SAIF, a market consistent valuation is performed as described in section ii below.
Additional assumptions required are for persistency and the management actions under which the fund is managed.
Assumptions used for a market-consistent valuation typically do not contain margins, whereas those used for the valuation of other classes of business do.
Mortality assumptions are set based on the results of the most recent experience analysis looking at the experience over recent years of the relevant business.
For non-profit business, a margin for adverse deviation is added.
Different assumptions are applied for different product groups.
For annuitant mortality, assumptions for current mortality rates are based on recent experience investigations and expected future improvements in mortality.
The expected future improvements are based on recent experience and projections of the business and industry experience generally.
Maintenance and, for some classes of business, termination expense assumptions are expressed as per policy amounts.
They are set based on the expenses incurred during the year, including an allowance for ongoing investment expenditure and allocated between entities and product groups in accordance with the operations internal cost allocation model.
For non-profit business a margin for adverse deviation is added to this amount.
Expense inflation assumptions are set consistent with the economic basis and based on the difference between yields on nominal gilts and index-linked gilts.
The actual renewal expenses incurred on behalf of SAIF by other Group companies are recharged in full to SAIF.
The assumptions for asset management expenses are based on the charges specified in agreements with the Groups asset management operations, plus a margin for adverse deviation for non-profit business.
Tax assumptions are set equal to current rates of taxation.
For non-profit business excluding unit-linked business, the valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are based on the yields as at the valuation date on the assets backing the technical provisions.
For fixed interest securities the gross redemption yield is used except for the non-profit annuities within PAC and PRIL annuity business where the internal rate of return of the assets backing the liabilities is used.
Properties are valued using the rental yield, and for equities it is the greater of the dividend yield and the average of the dividend yield and the earnings yield.
An adjustment is made to the yield on non-risk-free fixed interest securities and property to reflect credit risk.
To calculate the non-unit reserves for linked business, assumptions have been set for the gross unit growth rate and the rate of inflation of maintenance expenses, as well as for the valuation interest rate as described above.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 219 ii WPSF and SAIF The policyholder liabilities reported for the WPSF are primarily for two broad types of business.
These are accumulating and conventional with-profits contracts.
The policyholder liabilities of the WPSF are accounted for under FRS 27.
The provisions have been determined on a basis consistent with the detailed methodology included in regulations contained in the PRAs rules for the determination of reserves on the PRAs realistic Peak 2 basis.
In aggregate, the regime has the effect of placing a value on the liabilities of UK with-profits contracts, which reflects the amounts expected to be paid based on the current value of investments held by the with-profits funds and current circumstances.
These contracts are a combination of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participation features, as defined by IFRS 4.
The PRAs Peak 2 calculation under the realistic regime requirement is explained further in note A3.1 d under the UK regulated with-profits section.
The contract liabilities for with-profits business also require assumptions for persistency.
These are set based on the results of recent experience analysis.
The process of determining policyholder liabilities of SAIF is similar to that for the with-profits policies of the WPSF.
iii Annuity business Credit risk provisions For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholder-backed annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk.
Further details on credit risk allowance are provided in note B4 c. Mortality The mortality assumptions are set in light of recent population and internal experience.
The assumptions used are percentages of standard actuarial mortality tables with an allowance for future mortality improvements.
Where annuities have been sold on an enhanced basis to impaired lives an additional age adjustment is made.
The percentages of the standard table used are selected according to the source of business.
New mortality projection models are released annually by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI.
The CMI 2012 model was used to produce the 2014 and 2013 results, calibrated to reflect an appropriate view of future mortality improvements.
For annuities in payment, the tables and range of percentages used are set out below: Non-profitannuities withintheWPSF PRIL CMIModel,   Males Females Males Females 2014 CMI 2012 For males: with a long-term 93% 99% 89% 101% 91% 95% 84% 98% improvement rate of 2.25% pa PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 2013 CMI 2012 For females: with a long-term 93% 99% 89% 101% 91% 96% 84% 98% improvement rate of 1.50% pa. PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 For annuities in deferment, the tables used by both the non-profit annuities within the WPSF and PRIL were AM92 4 years males and AF92 4 years females for 2014 and 2013. iv Unit-linked non-annuity and other non-profit business The majority of other long-term business written in the UK insurance operations is unit-linked business or other business with similar features.
For these contracts the attaching liability reflects the unit value obligation and provision for expenses and mortality risk.
The latter component is determined by applying mortality assumptions on a basis that is appropriate for the policyholder profile.
For unit-linked business, the assets covering unit liabilities are exposed to market risk, but the residual risk when considering the unit-linked liabilities and assets together is limited to the effect on fund-based charges.
For those contracts where the level of insurance risk is insignificant, the assets and liabilities arising under the contracts are distinguished between those that relate to the financial instrument liability and acquisition costs and deferred income that relate to the component of the contract that relates to investment management.
Acquisition costs and deferred income are recognised consistent with the level of service provision in line with the requirements of IAS 18. v Effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and liabilities Credit risk There has been no change of approach in the setting of assumption levels of credit risk in 2014 and 2013.
However, changes in the portfolio have given rise to altered levels of credit risk allowance as set out in note B4 c. Other assumption changes The effect of other assumption changes and modelling adjustments for the shareholder-backed business is set out in note B4 c. For the with-profits sub-fund, the aggregate effect of assumption changes and modelling adjustments in 2014 was a net charge to unallocated surplus of 86 million 2013: net credit of 200 million, relating to changes in mortality assumptions, offsetting releases of margins, and altered expense, persistency and economic assumptions, where appropriate in the two periods.
