Of this, 106.4 million reflects temporary differences that arose from the application of taxation transfer pricing rules to the transfer of assets and liabilities from LBG during 2013.
In assessing the carrying value of the deferred tax asset arising from the transfer, management judgement was required in estimating the market value of the transferred balances which took into account an independent valuation of the transferred balances which was subsequently agreed with HMRC during the year.
Recoverability of the deferred tax asset also requires management judgement in assessing future levels of taxable profits expected to arise against which these temporary differences can be offset.
The Groups expectations of the level of future taxable profits takes into account the Groups Board approved medium term plan and associated risk factors including future economic outlook and regulatory change.
At 31 December 2014, the deferred tax asset arising from the transfer of assets and liabilities from LBG was recognised in full.
