Historically, the largest schemes have been local versions of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest dened benefit schemes are in the UK, the US and theNetherlands.
The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
The Netherlands scheme is a career average salary scheme and remains open to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their current salary at a rate calculated to enable them to reach a pension level based on their average salary.
Each of the major dened benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees of the pension funds in the UK and the Netherlands and plan duciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneciaries.
In the UK and in the Netherlands the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The boards of trustees consist of an equal number of company appointed and member nominated Directors.
In the US, the duciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pensions Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectied with additional contributions over a seven year period.
In the Netherlands, on a regulatory basis, with effect from 1 January 2015, the scheme funding level is determined by the new Financial Assessment Framework nFTK.
The nFTK introduces, inter alia, a 12 month average funding ratio, higher buffer requirements and stricter indexation than under previous legislation, and a 10 year recovery plan in the event of funding shortfalls.
In case of a shortfall in the funding level, the first recovery plans are required to be led with the Dutch Central Bank on 1 July 2015.
On a contractual basis, the employer contribution is capped at 11.9% of salary.
Total regular employer contributions to dened benefit pension schemes in respect of 2015 are expected to be approximately 65m.

Service cost, including settlements, past service credits and curtailments is presented within operating expenses.
Settlements and past service credits in 2014 relate to plan design changes and a reduction in accrued benets in respect of the scheme in the Netherlands.
Settlements and past service credits recognised in 2013 principally relate to plan design changes and the transfer out of certain deferred members in the US scheme and a reduction in accrued benets in respect of the scheme in the Netherlands.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries arepresented below.
The net dened benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.

indd 107 06 03 2015 12:43 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 108 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 5 Pension schemes continued The major categories and fair values of scheme assets at the end of the reporting period are as follows: FAIR VALUE OF SCHEME ASSETS 2014 2013 UK US NL Total UK US NL Total m m m m m m m m Equities 1,260 263 226 1,749 1,351 174 223 1,748 Government bonds 1,249 70 261 1,580 1,089 68 261 1,418 Corporate bonds 455 143 598 411 93 504 Property funds 270 30 300 147 34 181 Cash 74 2 5 81 87 4 3 94 Other 17 20 37 17 19 36 Total 2,870 810 665 4,345 2,691 676 614 3,981 The actual return on scheme assets for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 451m 2013: 283m.
Assets and obligations associated with the schemes are sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market-related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities.
In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or ination could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically the Groups schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the dened benefit obligations and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK, the US and the Netherlands decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks such as unanticipated future increases in: member mortality patterns: ination: and future salaries, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities particularly in the Netherlands which is the only major scheme which remains open to new members.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of dened benefit pensions in the short term and long term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds, property funds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on a variety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the statutory funded status of the plan.
All equities and government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of the Groups pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of themembers, ination and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience orfuture changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, ination and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the dened benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate 233 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected ination rate 121 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy 131 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the dened benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the dened benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in the above assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
