The above items are treated as exceptional by reason of their size or nature, as further described on page 112. a R elates to the introduction of the SICAD II exchange rate on 24 March 2014 and its adoption by the Group.
Of the three exchange rate mechanisms that currently exist in Venezuela, SICAD II is the most accessible to the Group for converting its bolivar earnings into US dollars.
The exceptional loss arises from the one-off re-measurement of the Groups bolivar assets and liabilities from the official exchange rate $1 6.3 VEF to the SICAD II exchange rate approximately $1 50 VEF.
The Group has used the SICAD II exchange rate for translating the results of its Venezuelan operations since 1 April 2014. b I n 2014, results from a partial cash-out of the UK unfunded pension arrangements and, in 2013, resulted from a buy-in and subsequent buy-out in 2014 of the Groups UK funded defined benefit obligations with the insurer, Rothesay Life.
See note 25 for further details.
c I n 2014, relates primarily to costs incurred in introducing a new HR operating model across the business to provide enhanced management information and more efficient processes, and to implement more efficient processes and procedures in the Groups Global Technology infrastructure to help mitigate future cost increases.
In 2012, arose from a reorganisation of the Groups support functions together with a restructuring within the AMEA region.
d R elates to the costs of securing a restructuring of the UK hotel portfolio which will result in the transfer of 61 managed hotels to franchise contracts.
e R elates to acquisition transaction costs incurred in the period to 31 December 2014 on the acquisition of Kimpton, which completed on 16 January 2015 see note 33. f R elated to an agreed settlement in respect of a lawsuit filed against the Group in the Greater China region.
g R elated to costs incurred in support of the worldwide rebranding of IHG Rewards Club that was announced 1 July 2013. h S oftware disposals in 2012 included an exceptional write-off of $18m resulting from a re-assessment of the ongoing value of elements of the technology infrastructure.
i R esulted from a release of a liability no longer required which arose on the demerger of the Group from Six Continents PLC.
j I n 2012, a previously recorded impairment charge relating to a North American hotel was reversed in full following a re-assessment of its recoverable amount, based on the market value of the hotel as determined by an independent professional property valuer.
k I n 2014, the charge comprises $56m relating to the disposal of an 80.1% interest in the InterContinental New York Barclay offset by a credit of $27m relating to a restructuring of the UK hotel portfolio and other reorganisation costs.
l I n 2013, comprised a deferred tax charge of $63m consequent on the disposal of the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel, together with charges and credits of $38m and $19m respectively from associated restructurings including intra-group dividends and refinancings, offset by the recognition of $37m of previously unrecognised tax credits.
In 2012, represented the recognition of $104m of deferred tax assets, principally relating to pre-existing overseas tax losses, whose value had become more certain as a result of a change in law and the resolution of prior period tax matters, together with the associated release of $37m of provisions.

Corporation tax liabilities did not arise in 2014 in the UK and are not expected to arise for a number of years thereafter due to expenses and associated tax losses attributable principally to employment matters, inparticular additional shortfall contributions made to the UK pension plan in the years 2007 to 2013.

2 Primarily relates to provisions, accruals, amortisation and share-based payments.
These assets have not been recognised as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise as a result of resolving tax uncertainties, or as a consequence of case law and legislative developments which make the value of the assets more certain.
The Group has provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries only to the extent that it is either probable that it will reverse in the foreseeable future or where the Group cannot control the timing of the reversal.
The remaining unprovided liability that would arise on the reversal of these temporary differences is not expected to exceed $10m 2013 $10m.

Therecoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period using growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
At 31 December 2014, the recoverable amount of the CGU has been assessed based on the approved budget for 2015 and strategic plans covering a five-year period, a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% 2013 3.5% and a discount rate of 13.7% 2013 15.5%.
The perpetual growth rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Pre-tax discount rates are used to discount the cash flows based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the businessmodel and territory of the CGU being tested.
Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013 and management have determined that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.

Financial risk management Overview The Groups treasury policy is to manage financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
The activities of the treasury function are carried out in accordance with Board approved policies and are subject to regular audit.
The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre.
The treasury function seeks to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group and manages liquidity to meet all foreseeable cash needs.
Treasury activities may include money market investments, spot and forward foreign exchange instruments, currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
One of the primary objectives of the Groups treasury risk management policy is to mitigate the adverse impact of movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market risk exposure The US dollar is the predominant currency of the Groups revenue andcash flows.
Movements in foreign exchange rates can affect theGroups reported profit, net assets and interest cover.
To hedge translation exposure, wherever possible, the Group matches the currency of its debt either directly or via derivatives to the currency ofits net assets, whilst maximising the amount of US dollars borrowedto reflect the predominant trading currency.
From time to time, foreign exchange transaction exposure is managed by the forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies.
Most significant exposures of the Group are in currencies that are freely convertible.
A general strengthening of the US dollar specifically a five cent fall in the sterling: US dollar rate would increase the Groups profit before tax by an estimated $4.5m 2013 $4.1m, 2012 $2.8m and increase net assets by an estimated $29.1m 2013 $16.0m, 2012 $1.8m.
Similarly, a five cent fall in the euro:US dollar rate would reduce the Groups profit before tax by an estimated $2.2m 2013 $2.6m, 2012 $2.3m and decrease net assets by an estimated $10.9m 2013 $14.8m, 2012 $16.1m.
Interest rate exposure is managed, using interest rate swaps if appropriate, within set parameters depending on the term of the debt, with a minimum fixed proportion of 25% of borrowings for each major currency.
No interest rate swaps were used during 2013 or 2014.
Based on the year-end net debt position plus the $400m bilateral term loan drawn in 2015 to finance the Kimpton acquisition see note 21, a one percentage point rise in USdollar interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge by $6.7m.
A similar rise in euro interest rates would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately $0.9m, and a similar rise in sterling interest rates would reduce the annual net interest charge by approximately $0.7m.
100% of borrowings in major currencies were fixed rate debt at 31 December 2013.
Liquidity risk exposure The treasury function ensures that the Group has access to sufficient funds to allow the implementation of the strategy set by the Board.
Medium and long-term borrowing requirements are met through the $1.07bn Syndicated Facility which expires in November 2016, through the 250m 6% bonds that are repayable on 9December 2016 and through the 400m 3.875% bonds repayable on 28 November 2022.
The bonds were issued under the Groups 750m Medium Term Notes programme.
Short-term borrowing requirements are met from drawings under bilateral bank facilities.
The Syndicated Facility contains two financial covenants: interest cover and net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group has been in compliance with all of the financial covenants in its loan documents throughout the year, none of which is expected to present a material restriction on funding in the near future.
At the year end, the Group had cash of $162m which is predominantly held in short-term deposits and cash funds which allow daily withdrawals of cash.
The Group also had overdrafts of $107m as part of cash pooling arrangements see note 17.
Most of the Groups funds are held in the UK or US, although $4m 2013 $12m is held in countries where repatriation is restricted as a result of foreign exchange regulations.
The Group had net liabilities of $717m at 31 December 2014 reflecting that its brands, in accordance with accounting standards, are not recorded on the balance sheet.
135 IHG Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 20.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk exposure Credit risk on treasury transactions is minimised by operating a policy on the investment of surplus cash that generally restricts counterparties to those with an A credit rating or better or those providing adequate security.
In order to manage the Groups credit risk exposure, the treasury function sets counterparty exposure limits using metrics including credit ratings, the relative placing of credit default swap pricings, Tier 1 capital and share price volatility of the relevant counterparty.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Itis the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In respect of credit risk arising from financial assets, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of theseinstruments.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern.
The capital structure consists of net debt, issued share capital and reserves totalling $808m at 31December 2014 2013 $1,071m.
The structure is managed to maintain an investment grade credit rating, to provide ongoing returns to shareholders and to service debt obligations, whilst maintaining maximum operational flexibility.
A key characteristic ofIHGs managed and franchised business model is that it is highlycash generative, with a high return on capital employed.
Surplus cash is either reinvested in the business, used to repay debt or returned to shareholders.
The Groups debt is monitored on the basis of a cash flow leverage ratio, being net debt divided by EBITDA, with the objective of maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
Hedging Interest rate risk The Group hedges its interest rate risk by ensuring that interest flows are fixed on at least 25% of its borrowings inmajor currencies.
If required, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure although none were held during 2013 or 2014.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on income streams denominated in foreign currencies.
From time to time, the Group hedges a portion of forecast foreign currency income by taking out forward exchange contracts.
The designated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk.
There were no such contracts in place at either 31December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The Group designates its foreign currency bank borrowings and currencyderivatives as net investment hedges of foreign operations.
Thedesignated risk is the spot foreign exchange risk for loans and shortdated derivatives.
The interest on these financial instruments is taken through financial income or expense.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held no currency swaps 2013 $415m and short dated foreign exchange swaps with principals of 220m 2013 75m and $31m 2013 $100m see note 22 for further details.
The maximum amount of foreign exchange derivatives held during the year as net investment hedges and measured at calendar quarter ends were currency swaps with a principal of $415m 2013 $415m and short dated foreign exchange swaps with principals of 220m 2013 75m and $165m 2013 $310m.
Hedge effectiveness is measured at calendar quarter ends.

Currency swaps At 31 December 2014, the Group held no currency swaps.
The currency swaps held at 31 December 2013 with a principal of $415m were transacted at the same time as the 250m 6% bonds were issued in December 2009 in order to swap the bonds proceeds and interest flows into US dollars.
Under the terms of the swaps, $415m was borrowed and 250m deposited for seven years at a fixed exchange rate of 1 $1.66.
The currency swaps were closed out in full during 2014 due to a reduction in the value of assets available for net investment hedging with $4m received as consideration on close of out the swaps.
The interest expense and principal on the 250m 6% bonds are now subject to currency fluctuations.
At 31 December 2013, the fair value of the currency swap comprised two components: $2m relating to the repayment of the underlying principal and $9m relating to interest payments.
The element relating to the underlying principal was disclosed as a component of net debt in 2013 see note 24.
The currency swaps were designated as net investment hedges.
Forward foreign exchange contracts At 31 December 2014, the Group held short dated foreign exchange swaps with total principal values of 220m 2013 75m and $31m 2013 $100m.
The swaps are used to manage sterling surplus cash and reduce euro and US dollar borrowings whilst maintaining operational flexibility.
The foreign exchange swaps have been designated as net investment hedges.

2 Financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value.
There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, or for which fair value is disclosed.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximates book value due to the short maturity of the investments and deposits, and the fair value of other financial assets approximates book value based on prevailing market rates.
The fair value of the secured and unsecured bank loans approximates book value as interest rates reset to market rates on a frequent basis.
The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and current provisions approximates to their carrying value, including the future redemption liability of the Groups loyalty programme.
Fair value hierarchy The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the above assets and liabilities, other than those with carrying amounts which are reasonable approximations of their fair values: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: o ther techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on fair value are observable, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable marketdata.

Fair value measurement continued The fair value of quoted equity shares and the bonds is based on their quoted market price.
Derivatives are fair valued using discounted future cash flows, taking into consideration exchange rates prevailing on the last day of the reporting period and interest rates from observable swap curves.
As the Groups derivatives are not cash collaterised, a valuation adjustment is made for credit risk, being counterparty risks in respect of derivative assets and own credit risks in respect of derivative liabilities.
At 31 December 2013, the interest rates used to fair value the currency swaps ranged from 1.4% to 2.5%, depending on the currency and the term of the derivative contract.
Finance lease obligations relate to the lease of the InterContinental Boston and are fair valued by discounting the future cash flows payable under the loan, which are fixed, at a risk adjusted long-term interest rate.
The interest rate used to discount the cash flows at 31 December 2014 was 7.4% 2013 8.4%.
Unquoted equity shares are fair valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines either by applying an average price-earnings P E ratio for a competitor group to the earnings generated by the investment or by reference to share of net assets if the investment is currently loss-making or a recent property valuation is available.
The average P E ratio for the year was 24.0 and anon-marketability factor of 30% is applied.
A 10% increase in the average P E ratio would result in a $3m increase 2013 $5m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in the average P E ratio would result in a $3m decrease 2013 $5m in the fair value of the investments.
A 10% increase in net assets would result in a $7m increase 2013 $5m in the fair value of the investments and a 10% decrease in net assets would result in a $7m decrease 2013 $5m in the fair value of the investments.

Retirement benefits UK Historically UK retirement and death in service benefits have been provided for eligible employees in the UK principally by the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan, which has both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section was subject to a buy-in transaction on 15 August 2013 whereby the assets of the plan were invested in a bulk purchase annuity policy with the insurer Rothesay Life under which the benefits payable to defined benefit members became fully insured.
On 31 October 2014, the plan completed the move to a full buy-out of the defined benefit section, following which Rothesay Life has become fully and directly responsible for the pension obligations.
On completion of the buy-out, the defined benefit assets comprising the Rothesay Life insurance policy and matching defined benefit liabilities were derecognised from the Group statement of financial position.
The buy-out transaction also triggered the return to the Company of the 3m that remained in the IHG Funding Trust.
On 6 August 2014, members of the defined contribution section of the plan were transferred to a new mirror plan, the IHG UK Defined Contribution Pension Plan.
Existing and new employees who are eligible for pension benefits in the UK, including those who have been auto-enrolled since 1 September 2013, are provided with defined contribution arrangements under this plan: benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
Both plans are HM Revenue & Customs registered and governed by a Trustee Board which comprises a combination of independent and company nominated trustees, assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
The overall operation of the plans is subject to the oversight of The Pensions Regulator.
The Trustee Board is currently in the process of winding-up the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan.
In addition to the above, additional benefits are provided to members of an unfunded pension arrangement who were affected by lifetime or annual allowances under the former defined benefit arrangements.
Accrual under this arrangement ceased with effect from 1 July 2013.
In March 2014, the Company made an offer to each member to cash-out their pension entitlement by means of a one-off lump sum cash payment.
Members had until 30 June 2014 to accept the offer with the Company reserving the right to revoke any acceptances up to the date of payment.
In the event, cash payments totalling 27m were made to the accepting members on 28 July 2014 with an additional 7m deferred for payment until 2015, thereby extinguishing approximately 70% of the unfunded pension obligations.
A charge over certain ring-fenced bank accounts totalling 31m at 31 December 2014 see note 15 is currently held as security on behalf of the remaining members of the unfunded arrangement.
US and other The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded Inter-Continental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Non-qualified Pension Plans and unfunded Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation Postretirement Medical, Dental, Vision and Death Benefit Plan.
All plans are closed to new members.
In respect of the funded plan, an Investment Committee has responsibility for the oversight and management of the plans assets, which are held in a separate trust.
The Committee comprises senior company employees and is assisted by professional advisers as and when required.
The company currently makes contributions that equal or exceed the minimum funding amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 ERISA.
The investment objective is to achieve full funding over time by following a specified glide path approach which results in a progressive switching from return seeking assets to liability-matching assets as the funded status of the plan increases.
During the year, the funded status reached 85% which triggered a further fide-risking of the investment portfolio.
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension schemes outside the UK, themost significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benefits Total 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 2 5 1 1 1 1 3 6 Past service cost 1 1 Net interest expense 2 1 3 3 3 1 1 1 6 4 5 Administration costs 3 1 1 1 1 3 2 2 Operating profit before exceptional items 5 3 7 4 6 5 1 1 1 10 10 13 Exceptional items: Settlement cost 6 147 6 147 11 150 7 4 6 5 1 1 1 16 157 13 142 GROUP PARENT COMPANY ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 25.
Retirement benefits continued The settlement cost in 2014 results from the partial cash-out of the UK unfunded pension arrangements and comprises transaction and related social security costs of $9m, offset by the $3m difference between the accounting value of the liabilities extinguished and the amount of the committed cash-out payments.
In 2014, related cash payments of $53m are included in cash flows relating to exceptional operating items in the Group statement of cash flows.
The settlement cost in 2013 resulted from the buy-in transaction described on the previous page and comprised a past service cost of $5m relating to additional benefits secured by the transaction, the $137m difference between the cost of the insurance policy and the accounting value of the liabilities secured and transaction costs of $5m.
As the policy was structured to enable the planto move to a buy-out and the intention was to proceed on that basis, the buy-in transaction was accounted for as a settlement with the loss arising recorded in the income statement.
The full buy-out was completed on 31 October 2014.

Retirement benefits continued Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligations are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benefits 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 % % % % % % % % % Wages and salaries increases 4.5 4.0 Pensions increases 3.3 3.6 3.0 Discount rate 3.7 4.6 4.5 3.6 4.5 3.5 3.7 4.6 3.5 Inflation rate 3.3 3.6 3.0 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year: Pre 65 ultimate rate reached in 2021 8.0 8.5 9.0 Post 65 ultimate rate reached in 2024 12.5 17.5 11.8 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 5.0 5.2 5.0 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The current assumptions for the UK are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1.25% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by three years for pensioners and non-pensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP-2014 Employee Healthy Annuitant Generationally Projected with Scale MP-2014 mortality tables.
In both territories, the assumptions have been revised during the year to reflect increased life expectancy at retirement age as follows: Pension plans UK US 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Years Years Years Years Years Years 1 Current pensioners at 65 male 26 24 24 22 21 19 female 29 27 27 24 23 21 2 Future pensioners at 65 male 28 27 27 23 22 21 female 31 30 30 25 25 22 1 Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.
2 Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years relating to an employee retiring in 2034.
The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
Sensitivities Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The key assumptions are the pension increases, discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on extrapolating reasonable changes in these assumptions, using year-end conditions and assuming no interdependency between the assumptions.
