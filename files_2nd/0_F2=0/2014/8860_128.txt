Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 16 Goodwill continued Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
As a result of the divisional reorganisation, the CGUs have been revised.
Goodwill is now allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2014 2013 2014 2013 restated million million million million Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 79.9 82.1 Process Technologies 305.1 314.3 113.0 110.5 Precious Metal Products Other 7.9 8.5 Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 19.8 21.8 Research Chemicals 22.0 21.6 Other 1.3 1.5 New Businesses Battery Technologies 15.0 15.1 Other 2.9 2.6 0.3 571.0 584.6 113.3 110.5 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period except as discussed below.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual forward rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
For the Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU four 2013 five year plans have been approved by management.
The cash flow projections have been extrapolated using a long term average growth rate of 3.0% 2013 3.0%.
For the Battery Technologies CGU four year plans have been approved by management.
Over the next decade management expects the business to grow rapidly and so the cash flow projections for years five to ten have been extrapolated using an 18.0% growth rate.
The long term growth rate is then 5.0% 2013 5.0% and the discount rate was 14.8% 2013 12.0%.
For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate used was 3.4% 2013 3.2% and the discount rate was 11.4% 2013 11.4%.
For Macfarlan Smith the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2013 2.5% and the discount rate was 7.3% 2013 6.9%.
For Pharmaceutical Materials and Services the long term average growth rate used was 3.0% 2013 3.0% and the discount rate was 8.6% 2013 8.3%.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 4.0% 2013 5.0% and the discount rate was 8.2% 2013 8.4%.
All the impairment tests result in headroom of more than 50% over the carrying value of the relevant CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
