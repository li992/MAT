FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 90 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17 FINANCIAL ASSET In 2005, the Group disposed of its Mongolia interest to Daqing Oilfield Limited Company.
Under the terms of the transaction the Group will receive a subsequent payment amount of up to $52.7 million, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels is expected to be between one to two years from the date of this report, however the price of Daqing marker crude oil cannot accurately be predicted.
Based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made Level 3 as defined in IFRS 7.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash flows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was $31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2014 the fair value was $45.0 million 2013 $43.4 million after accounting for the change in fair value see Note 7.
18 OTHER RECEIVABLES Other receivables comprise the Group`s share of contributions made into two abandonment security funds which were established to ensure that sufficient funds exist to meet future abandonment obligations on the TGT and CNV fields.
The funds are operated by PetroVietnam and JOC partners retain the legal rights to the funds pending commencement of abandonment operations.
