Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein relating to proved oil and gas reserves The following tables set out the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and changes therein, relating to crude oil and natural gas production from the groups estimated proved reserves.
This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.
Future net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized.
These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months.
Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.
BP cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.
