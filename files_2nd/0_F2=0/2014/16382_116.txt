COM BRINGING SANITATION TO THE WORLDS POOREST CONSUMERS In India around 600 million people, like Saritadevi pictured, do not have access to a toilet in their house, leaving them no choice but to use local fields.
Unilever is committed to helping 25 million people gain improved access to a toilet by 2020, by promoting the benefits of using clean toilets and making toilets accessible.
We are working with multiple partners, including UNICEF, to create sustainable approaches to better sanitation by promoting good hygiene practices to improve the health and well-being of communities and helping to create demand for access to toilets.
We are also working with Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor WSUP to develop innovative sanitation businesses and promote hygiene communications to millions of the poorest consumers in Ghana, Bangladesh, Kenya and Zambia.
And we are providing support through the Domestos Toilet Academy, a market-based model that improves sanitation in India and Vietnam.
By the end of 2014 there were ten Domestos Toilet Academies open, eight in India and two in Vietnam.
The Academies train entrepreneurs to form businesses supplying, installing and maintaining hygienic toilets.
The initiative will train 250 entrepreneurs and supply 51,000 toilets by the end of 2015.
The photograph of Saritadevi was taken for WSUP by Atul Loke.
