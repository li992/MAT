Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings or cross-currency swaps in the relevant foreign currency.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2014 92 Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Results Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a, reasonably possible, 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.

The effect on shareholders equity is due to the effect on profit as well as the effect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies qualified as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Further details of the currency profile of borrowings are given in note 23.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
This is reviewed regularly and is managed through the use of an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate instruments in response to market conditions.
The impact of interest rate risk on the Group's result is due to changes in interest rates on net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
At 31 August 2014, if interest rates on the Group's net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings had been 100 basis points higher, a reasonably possible movement, with all other variables held constant, the effect on profit before taxation in the year would have been a credit of 0.6m 2013: 0.7m.
A reduction of 100 basis points would have the equal and opposite effect.
There is no further impact on shareholders' equity.
Further details of the interest rate profile of borrowings are given in note 23.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient resources are available for both short-term working capital and longer-term strategic requirements.
This is achieved through an appropriate mix of long and short-term borrowings and, as far as possible, the major part of the Groups total borrowings are managed so that they are drawn down using committed debt facilities which would not mature for at least one year.
The Groups principal loan facilities are raised and managed centrally but are supplemented by local overdraft and working capital facilities.
Committed debt facilities principally comprise revolving bank credit facilities and private placements.
The Group regularly monitors expected cash flows against availability of financing.
Regular updating of business forecasts, including cash flows, is a process embedded into the Groups internal financial reporting routines.
Forecasts are initially carried out at an individual operating unit level, but are consolidated and reviewed by Group management.
The availability of financing, headroom over existing facilities and forward compliance with financial covenants are monitored against expected cash flows.
The process takes into account the shorter-term liquidity needs of individual operating units or territories as well as the availability of funding to fulfil longer-term strategic objectives such as major capital expenditure or business acquisitions.
