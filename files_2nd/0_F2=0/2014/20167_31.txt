l IFRS accounting subsidiary l UK Companies Act subsidiary 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Portfolio and other information 155 The UK Companies Act defines a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary.
IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed anaccounting subsidiary.
