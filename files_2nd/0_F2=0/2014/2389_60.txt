Disposals and impairment continued Other businesses and corporate Impairment losses totalling $317 million, $218 million, and $320 million were recognized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
The amount for 2014 is principally in respect of our biofuels businesses in the UK and US.
The amount for 2013 is principally in respect of our US wind business.
The amount for 2012 is principally in respect of the decision not to proceed with an investment in a biofuels production facility under development in the US.
Segmental analysis The groups organizational structure reflects the various activities in which BP is engaged.
At 31 December 2014, BP had three reportable segments: Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.
Upstreams activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production: midstream transportation, storage and processing: and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas LNG, together with power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
Downstreams activities include the refining, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and supply and trading of crude oil, petroleum, petrochemicals products and related services to wholesale and retail customers.
During 2013, BP completed transactions for the sale of BPs interest in TNK-BP to Rosneft, and for BPs further investment in Rosneft.
BPs interest in Rosneft is accounted for using the equity method and is reported as a separate operating segment, reflecting the way in which the investment is managed.
Other businesses and corporate comprises the biofuels and wind businesses, the groups shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.
The Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO, which manages all aspects of our response to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico incident, reports directly to the group chief executive and is overseen by a board committee, however it is not an operating segment.
Its costs are presented as a reconciling item between the sum of the results of the reportable segments and the group results.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before a interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss inventory holding gains and losses.
Replacement cost profit or loss for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale.
The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Downstream.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate.
However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for BP, and for the UK as this is BPs countryof domicile.
a Inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out FIFO method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory.
For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operations production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.
No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
