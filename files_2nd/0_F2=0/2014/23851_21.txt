FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, the Companies Act that apply to companies reporting under IFRS, IFRIC interpretations and with the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP, issued January 2009.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
All of the Companys activities are inter-related and each activity is dependent on the others.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment and therefore segmental information is not required.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Changes in accounting policy and disclosures IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement was adopted in the year.
"At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: t '34 'JOBODJBM OTUSVNFOUT SFWJTFE t '34 $POTPMJEBUFE 'JOBODJBM 4UBUFNFOUT t '34 PJOU ""SSBOHFNFOUT t '34 %JTDMPTVSFT PG OUFSFTUT JO 0UIFS &OUJUJFT t '34 3FHVMBUPSZ %FGFSSBM ""DDPVOUT t ""4 $POTPMJEBUFE BOE 4FQBSBUF 'JOBODJBM 4UBUFNFOUT t ""4 OWFTUNFOUT JO ""TTPDJBUFT BOE PJOU 7FOUVSFT It is anticipated that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial effect on the financial statements of the Company."
c Presentation of the Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net profit after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Significant accounting estimates and judgements The directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unquoted equity investments have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the possible valuations in the event of a listing and other marketability related risks.
e Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate certain derivatives, such as contracts for difference CFDs, are used.
Income derived from these is included in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2014 44 44 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued f Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
"g Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: t ""OZ QFSGPSNBODF GFF JG EVF JT BMMPDBUFE FOUJSFMZ UP DBQJUBM BT UIF #PBSE CFMJFWFT JU SFGMFDUT UIF DBQJUBM QFSGPSNBODF PG UIF Companys investments: t 5IF JOWFTUNFOU NBOBHFNFOU GFF BOE GJOBODF DPTUT BSF BMMPDBUFE FRVBMMZ CFUXFFO SFWFOVF BOE DBQJUBM BOE t ""MM PUIFS FYQFOTFT BSF BMMPDBUFE JO GVMM UP SFWFOVF XJUI UIF FYDFQUJPO PG UIPTF EJSFDUMZ BUUSJCVUBCMF UP TIBSF JTTVFT PS PUIFS capital events."
h Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of taxation currently payable and, if applicable, deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except when it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Companies which are approved as Investment Trusts under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
i Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
j Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as bid or last prices depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted or are not frequently traded are stated at the best estimate of fair value, based on recognised valuation techniques which may take account of the most recent arms length transactions in the investment.
Valuation reports are provided to the Board by the Managers Fair Value Committee, which is independent of the Managers Portfolio Management team.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within Gains on investments designated at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed them in Note 10 below.
k Derivative instruments Where appropriate, certain permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include forward currency contracts, CFDs, futures, options and warrants.
They are valued at fair value which is measured as the trade price quoted for the contract.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2014 45 45 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in Net derivative expense income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in Net gains losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Current liabilities.
As part of an established policy, premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are included in Net gains losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
During the year the Company has obtained equivalent exposure to Chinese and Hong Kong equities through the use of long CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
CFDs are valued at fair value which is the difference between the settlement price and the value, calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 i, of the underlying shares in the contract.
All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Net gains losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Dividends received and interest paid on long CFDs and interest received and dividends paid on short CFDs are included in Net derivative expense income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
l Bank loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.

Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of level 3 investments with a fair value of 33,245,000 2013: 19,366,000. n Dividends Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.

18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MANAGEMENT OF RISK The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Managers, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the operational risks that the Company faces.
Risks identified are strategic, marketing and business development, investment management, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support function risks.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation of risks, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Principal risks identified are in the Strategic Report on pages 13 and 14.
This Note is incorporated in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.

The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2014 54 54 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through price movements in its investment positions.
The Portfolio Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in, and in accordance with, the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
The Board meets quarterly to review the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has long and short CFDs and a multicurrency revolving credit facility for US$150,000,000 expiring on 14 February 2017.

Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are shown in Note 13 above.
Counterparty risk All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis Function of the Manager.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored frequently by the Manager.
For the long CFDs and options and in accordance with terms outlined in the International Swap Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal contracts, collateral is used to reduce the credit risk exposure for both parties to the transaction.
Collateral is managed and monitored on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.

Limits are established for each broker and are kept under review by the Managers.
Exposure to credit risk arises on cash at bank, outstanding investment transactions and the derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments risk A Derivative Instrument Charter, including an appendix entitled Derivative Risk Measurement and Management, details the risks and risk management processes used by the Managers.
