Certain deferred tax assets in respect of overseas corporation tax losses and other temporary differences totalling 137m 2013: 163m have not been recognised at 31 December 2014 as the likelihood of future economic benefit is not sufficiently assured.
These assets will be recognised if utilisation of the losses and other temporary differences becomes reasonably certain.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.
