Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UK GAAP 31 December 2014 1 GENERAL INFORMATION These separate financial statements have been prepared under UK GAAP in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention and are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year unless otherwise stated.
CLS Holdings plc is the ultimate parent company of the CLS Holdings group.
Its primary activity which occurs exclusively in the United Kingdom is to hold shares in subsidiary companies.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts as detailed in the Directors Report on page 38.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
2.1 Investment in Group companies Investments are valued at cost, less provisions for impairment.
If the equity value of the investment is lower than cost, the valuation is adjusted accordingly, provided that management considers this to be a permanent diminution in value.
Dividend income is recognised when received.
2.2 Pension costs The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all eligible employees.
The pension costs charged represent the contributions payable.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.3 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
Where a Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company.
2.4 Related party transactions Advantage has been taken of the exemption allowed in FRS 8 not to disclose transactions with entities which are wholly owned within the Group where consolidated accounts are publicly available.
There were no other related party transactions during the year.
2.5 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Tangible assets denominated in foreign currencies are shown at historical cost.
Current assets and all liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the financial year.
All differences are recognised in profit before tax.
