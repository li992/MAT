During the last year markets have been impacted by a number of notable events, including the Russia Ukraine crisis, a growing threat from the Islamic State group, the Ebola epidemic and an extended drop in oil prices.
Despite these factors, equities, credit and government bonds generally posted positive returns, though performance was challenging for emerging markets and very weak for commodities.
Against this backdrop, AllBlue Limited AllBlue generated a return of 6.26% Class A USD with modest correlation to traditional asset classes, low volatility and tight control of downside risk.
Reviewing 2014, each of the seven underlying strategies provided a positive contribution, with the largest contributions from the BlueCrest Quantitative Equity strategy achieved through BlueMatrix prior to 1 December 2014 and BlueCrest Quantitative Equity thereafter and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit.
In combination, AllBlue retained its record of continual positive annual returns, and has been positive over every rolling 12 month period since inception.
In each of the first two quarters of the year, gains were generated across all but one of the underlying funds, with performance led by BlueTrend and Multi Strategy Credit respectively.
In the third quarter all but two of the underlying funds were positive.
In the fourth quarter, whilst gains were made by four of the underlying funds, led by BlueCrest Quantitative Equity BlueMatrix prior to 1 December 2014 and BlueTrend, the sharp market reversals seen in October and December led to small losses in the BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit, BlueCrest Emerging Markets and BlueCrest Capital International funds, reducing the overall return for AllBlue during that period.
During the year, the allocations to BlueCrest Quantitative Equity BlueMatrix prior to 1 December 2014 and BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit were increased to reflect the allocation committees view that an attractive opportunity set was available for those strategies based on individual security selection.
In June 2014, the BlueCrest Equity Strategies Fund was added to further diversify the strategy mix within AllBlue: the fund operates a multi-portfolio manager, multi strategy approach, covering global equity 10 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited 2014 Investment Manager Report markets.
Conversely, the allocation committee saw a less attractive opportunity set available for more macro-based strategies, and consequently allocations were reduced to the BlueTrend and BlueCrest Capital International funds.
The allocation to the BlueCrest Emerging Markets fund was also reduced to reflect increased uncertainty and heightened geopolitical influences in those markets.
Other allocation changes were less significant and were made to capture shifts in relative market opportunities through the period.
Throughout the course of the year AllBlues VaR Historic Simulation, 95% confidence, 1 day VaR has averaged 0.25%, slightly lower than the average for 2013, with a low of 0.20% being seen in August and October and a high of 0.33% being observed in February and May.
The underlying funds continued to hold significant levels of unencumbered cash, with levels at year-end ranging from 20% in BlueCrest Mercantile to 82% in BlueTrend.
The imputed cash level for AllBlue was around 47% at year-end.
A high level of diversification was seen between the underlying funds, with the average correlation being 8%.
The highest correlation in 2014, measured on weekly data, was between BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit and BlueCrest Emerging Markets 50%, whilst the lowest correlation was observed between BlueCrest Quantitative Equity and BlueCrest Mercantile -47%.
Looking forward, the US economy is picking up steam, but with declining inflation and the headwinds of a strong US Dollar, the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate hikes until later in the year, which may also be influential for the timing of the Bank of Englands potential interest rate rise.
The ECB announced the commencement of its own quantitative easing early in 2015, finally following the actions taken previously by other major central banks, but political pressures have mounted in individual countries and could lead to deeper cracks in the currency union.
In Japan, Prime Minister Abe will press on with reforms, aiming to bring inflation through whatever means possible.
The tussle between the opposing actions of the central banks of the US UK on one hand, and those of Europe Japan on the other, is likely to introduce higher volatility to markets, which should benefit the trading style of our funds.
Further sources of uncertainty include the level of oil prices and the impact on emerging markets, US Dollar currency strength and a range of geopolitical threats.
AllBlues underlying strategies have the capability to deliver returns irrespective of market direction, with both the discretionary and systematic funds likely to benefit from the stronger expected influence of fundamental factors on the assets within their respective trading universes.
