Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 239 C9:  a  The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 84 per cent 2013: 84 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable SASPS and M&G M&GGPS.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
Under the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the Company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed.
Further, the IFRS financial position recorded, reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and any obligation for committed deficit funding where applicable.
The Group asset liability in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2014 m 2013 m Other Other PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total note i note ii note i note ii Underlying economic surplus deficit 840 144 60 1 755 726 115 36 1 646 note i Less: unrecognised surplus 710 710 602 602 Economic surplus deficit including investment in Prudential insurance policies 130 144 60 1 45 124 115 36 1 44 Attributable to: PAC with-profits fund 91 72 19 87 58 29 Shareholder-backed operations 39 72 60 1 26 37 57 36 1 15 Consolidation adjustment against policyholder liabilities for investment in Prudential insurance note iii policies 132 132 114 114 IAS 19 pension asset liability on the Group statement of note iv financial position 130 144 72 1 87 124 115 78 1 70 Notes i For PSPS, the Group does not have an unconditional right of refund to any surplus of the scheme.
The PSPS pension asset represents the present value of the economic benefit impact of the Company from the difference between future ongoing contributions to the scheme and estimated accrued cost of service.
No deficit or other funding is required for PSPS.
Deficit funding, where applicable, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations following detailed considerations in 2005 of the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
ii The deficit of SASPS has been allocated approximately 50 per cent to the PAC with-profits fund and 50 per cent to the shareholders fund.
iii The underlying position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential insurance policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
iv At 31 December 2014, the PSPS pension asset of 130 million 2013: 124 million and the other schemes pension liabilities of 217 million 2013: 194 million are included within Other debtors and Provisions respectively on the consolidated statement of financial position.
240 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C9:   All of the schemes are required to carry out a full actuarial valuation every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The information on the latest completed actuarial valuation for the UK schemes is shown in the table below: PSPS SASPS M&GGPS Last completed actuarial valuation date 5 April 2011 31 March 2011 31 December 2011 Valuation actuary, all Fellow of the C.

The market value of PSPS scheme assets as at the 5 April 2011 valuation was 5,255 million.
The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the purposes of the 2011 valuation were as follows: % Rate of increase in salaries Nil Rate of inflation: Retail Prices Index RPI 3.7 Consumer Prices Index CPI 3.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: Guaranteed maximum 5% 3.0 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 Discretionary Nil Expected returns on plan assets 4.2 Mortality assumptions: The tables used for PSPS pensions in payment at 5 April 2011 were: Base post-retirement mortality For current male female pensioners 113% 108% of the mortality rates of the 2000 series mortality tables PNMA00 PNFA00, published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI.
For male female non-pensioners 107% 92% of the 2000 series rates PNMA00 PNFA00.
Allowance for future improvements to post-retirement mortality For males females 100% 75% of Medium Cohort subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 2.00% 1.25% up to the age of 90, decreasing linearly to zero by age of 120 with a long-term rate of 1.75% pa 1.5% pa but adjusted as follows: Period improvements are blended between ages 60 to 80 to the long-term improvement rate over a 15 year period compared with a 20 year period in the core CMI model : and Cohort improvements are assumed to dissipate over a 30 year period, or by age 90 if earlier compared with a 40 year period, or by age 100 if earlier, in the core CMI model.
The next triennial valuations for the PSPS, SASPS and M&GGPS as at 5 April 2014, 31 March 2014 and 31 December 2014, respectively are currently in progress.
Financial statements C: Balance sheet notes Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 241  Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks and the most significant of which are detailed below: Interest rate and investment risk this risk arises because the schemes are not invested wholly in assets that most closely match the expected future cash flows.
Therefore, falling equity markets and bond yields may lead to higher deficits in the schemes.
Details of the investment portfolio of the schemes are provided in section c : Inflation risk the majority of the benefit obligations of all three schemes are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities: and Mortality risk increases in life expectancy of the members would mean that benefits are paid for longer and will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
Corporategovernance The Groups UK pension schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Trustees have been appointed for each pension scheme and they have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
The Trustees are required by the Pension Regulator to be well conversant with the Trust Deed & Rules and to act in accordance with these Rules.
The Rules of the Groups largest pension arrangement, the defined benefit section of PSPS, a final salary scheme, specify that, in exercising its investment powers, the Trustees objective is to achieve the best overall investment return consistent with the security of the assets of the scheme.
In doing this, consideration is given to the nature and duration of the schemes liabilities.
The Trustee sets the general investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
The Trustee reviews strategy, the asset mix benchmark and the Investment Managers objectives every three years, to coincide with the Actuarial Valuation, or earlier if the Scheme Actuary recommends.
Interim reviews are conducted annually based on changing economic circumstances and financial market levels.
The Trustee consults the Principal Employer, the Prudential Assurance Company, on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustee.
The investment policies and strategies for the other two UK defined benefit schemes, the SASPS and M&GGPS, which are both final salary schemes, follow similar principles, but have different target allocations reflecting the particular requirements of the schemes.
All of the three UK schemes are closed to new entrants.
The majority of the scheme liabilities are linked to inflation.
The assets that would most closely match the liabilities are a combination of index-linked government bonds or investment grade derivatives to match these inflation-linked liabilities and fixed interest gilts to match the fixed liabilities of the schemes.
These matching assets generally are expected to generate lower future returns than asset classes such as equities.
The risk that must be traded off against investing in higher expected returns assets is increased volatility of the schemes return and higher risk of default.
The Trustee of each of the schemes manages the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
When determining the investment strategy, the Trustee considers the risk that falls in asset values may not be matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes liabilities.
It also consults the Principal Employer, in order to understand the Principal Employers appetite for bearing this risk and considers the Employers ability to make good any shortfall that may arise.
The PSPS scheme has entered into a derivatives based strategy to match the duration and inflation profile of its liabilities.
This involved a reallocation from other investments to other assets with an interest and inflation swap overlay.
In broad terms, the scheme is committed to making a series of payments related to LIBOR on a nominal amount and in return the scheme receives a series of fixed and inflation-linked payments which match a proportion of its liabilities.
As at 31 December 2014, the nominal value of the interest and inflation-linked swaps amounted to 0.8 billion 2013: 0.8 billion and negative 3.0 billion 2013: 2.7 billion respectively.
The SASPS and M&GGPS use very limited or no derivatives to hedge their risks.
The risks arising from these schemes are managed through well diversified investments with a portion of the scheme assets invested in inflation-indexed bonds to provide a partial hedge against inflation.
The M&G pension scheme also invests in leveraged gilts as part of its asset liability management.
242 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements C:  C9:  b Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2014 % 2013 % Discount rate 3.5 4.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.0 3.3 Rate of inflation Retail prices index RPI 3.0 3.3 Consumer prices index CPI 2.0 2.3 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.0 3.3 The discount rate has been determined by reference to an AA corporate bond index, adjusted where applicable, to allow for the difference in duration between the index and the pension liabilities.
The rate of inflation reflects the long-term assumption for the UK RPI or CPI depending on the tranche of the schemes.
The calculations are based on current actuarially calculated mortality estimates with a specific allowance made for future improvements in mortality.
The specific allowance made is in line with a custom calibration and has been updated in 2014 to reflect the 2012 mortality model from the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries CMI.
The tables used for PSPS immediate annuities in payment at 31 December 2014 were: Male: 114.0 per cent PNMA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2012 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum: and Female: 108.5 per cent PNFA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2012 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.25 per cent per annum.
The tables used for PSPS immediate annuities in payment at 31 December 2013 were: Male: 112.0 per cent PNMA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2011 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum: and Female: 108.5 per cent PNFA00 with improvements in line with a custom calibration of the CMIs 2011 mortality model, with a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.25 per cent per annum.
The assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 60, based on the mortality table used was: 2014 years 2013 years Male Female Male Female Retiring today 28.1 29.7 27.9 29.5 Retiring in 20 years time 30.6 32.7 31.5 32.8 The mean term of the current PSPS liabilities is around 17 years.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the scheme actuaries being Towers Watson for the valuation of PSPS, Xafinity Consulting for SASPS and Aon Hewitt Limited for the M&GGPS, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2014, applying the principles prescribed by IAS 19. c  This section illustrates the financial position of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes on an economic basis and the IAS 19 basis.
The underlying pension position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
The IAS 19 basis excludes the investments in Prudential policies.
At 31 December 2014, the investments in Prudential insurance policies comprise 131 million 2013: 143 million for PSPS and 132 million 2013: 114 million for the M&GGPS.
In principle, on consolidation the investments are eliminated against policyholder liabilities of UK insurance operations, so that the formal IAS 19 position for the scheme in isolation excludes these items.
This treatment applies to the M&GGPS investments.
However, as a substantial portion of the Companys interest in the underlying surplus of PSPS is not recognised, the adjustment is not necessary for the PSPS investments.
