These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention modified to include revaluation of certain financial instruments, share options and pension assets and liabilities held at fair value.
As permitted by Section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the Companys entity profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses have not been presented.
As permitted by Section 408 2 information about the Companys employee numbers and costs is not presented.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8: Related Party Disclosures not to disclose transactions with other wholly owned members of the Smiths Group.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the retranslation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the term of the lease.
Where a leasehold property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, provision is made for the anticipated future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
In general, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2%: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease: Plant, machinery, etc.
10% to 20%: Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment 10% to 33%.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 129 to 134 for recognition, measurement and presentation of financial instruments are applied in the Company accounts.
Where there are no differences between the disclosures required for the Group and the Company in respect of a class of financial instruments, an appropriate cross-reference is made to the Group accounts.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed as at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as disclosed in the accounts, arising from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the accounts.
Deferred tax is not recognised on any fixed assets that have been revalued unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset.
Provisions Provisions for disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
178 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2014 Post-retirement benefits The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
For defined benefit plans the liability for each scheme recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the profit and loss account, and are presented in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Contributions are expensed as incurred.
The Company also has certain post-retirement healthcare schemes which are accounted for on a similar basis to the defined benefit plans.
Share-based payment The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to reflect the value of the employee services received.
The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account and the charge for grants to employees of other group companies is recognised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary.
The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option pricing models, principally binomial models.
The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options which are likely to vest.
For cash-settled share-based payment a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date.
For equity-settled share-based payment the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised.
The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

8 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a defined benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2012.
This valuation has been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 July 2014.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.2% 4.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3% 3.4% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.3% 3.4% Discount rate 4.0% 4.4% Inflation rate 3.3% 3.4% Healthcare cost increases 4.3% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2013 CMI projections blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The assumptions give thefollowing: Expected further years of life 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 23 25 23 25 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 25 27 25 27 182 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2014 8 Post-retirement benefits continued The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2014 were: 31 July 2014 31 July 2013 Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m Equities 7.3% 23.5 7.2% 903.6 Government bonds 3.2% 508.5 3.3% 5.4 Corporate bonds 4.0% 266.5 4.4% 273.7 Insured liabilities 4.0% 30.9 4.4% 30.1 Property 6.9% 180.8 6.8% 176.0 Cash and money market funds 3.2% 628.9 3.4% 192.1 Total market value 1,639.1 1,580.9 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 1,784.5 1,714.4 Deficit 145.4 133.5 Unfunded pension plans 49.9 48.3 Post-retirement healthcare 7.1 7.8 Net retirement benefit liability 202.4 189.6 The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

In connection with SIPS, an on-going investment of 24m a year in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow will be allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
Contributions to the scheme are made on the advice of the scheme actuaries.

At 31 July 2014 the Trust held 855 2013: 855 ordinary shares.
The Companys profit and loss reserve of 1,767.3m includes 895.7m 2013: 895.7m not available for distribution as dividend.
During the year, the Company received 5.8m 2013: 9.3m on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options awarded under various share option schemes.
Other reserves arose from the cancellation of the share premium arising from an equity-funded acquisition in the year ended 30 July 1988.
11 Deferred tax The Company is part of a UK tax group including all its UK-based subsidiaries.
At 31 July 2011 the Company recognised UK tax assets relating to revenue losses brought forward of 27.8m, and other timing differences of 4.0m.
The value of these assets is reviewed regularly and is dependent on the ability to recover them against forecast UK taxable profits of the tax group.
Having considered the impact of the increased pension deficit on the outlook for the UK tax base, the Company decided to derecognise the tax assets at 31 July 2012 because it is no longer probable that they will be recovered.
At 31 July 2014 the Company has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 91.2m 2013: 90.0m relating to: retirement benefit obligations 39.2m 2013: 36.5m losses carried forward 48.4m 2013: 49.9m : share-based payments 1.8m 2013: 2.0m : and other timing differences 1.8m 2013: 1.6m.
These tax allowances remain available to the Company and can be utilised should the UK tax base improve.
12 Contingent liabilities The Company has provided guarantees and arranged letter of credit facilities to support the Groups pension plans.
The current amount outstanding under letters of credit is 50.9m 2013: 52.1m.
The Company has guaranteed the US$800m revolving credit facility available to a subsidiary.
13 Post balance sheet event The directors propose a final dividend of 27.5p per share totalling approximately 108.5m for the year ended 31 July 2014.
The dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 18 November 2014.
In accordance with FRS 21, these financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 July 2015.
During the year ended 31 July 2014, a final dividend of 27.00p per share totalling 106.4m and a special dividend of 30.00p per share totalling 118.3m were paid in respect of the dividends declared for the year ended 31 July 2013.
