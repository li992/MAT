Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate.
Mineral resources are reported at variable metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions and appropriate metallurgical recoveries.
For the open pit mineral resources, silver grades and contained metal are based on metallurgical production data and have not been estimated.
Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of cut-off grades and metal equivalent grades are: Gold US$ oz 1,150.00, Silver US$ oz 18.00, Lead US$ lb 0.95 and Zinc US$ lb 0.95 1 The cut-off grade for Cinegas mineral resources varies between the following range: 1.35 to 2.64 g t Au equivalent.
2 The Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,350 oz Au price.
3 The Herradura open pit mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 1.1 g t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model.
Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the veins resource is 0.46Moz and projected in situ Inferred silver in the veins resource is 0.95Moz.
4 Herradura mineral resources are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade.
Oxide material above 0.30 g t Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material from 0.35 to 0.60 g t Au report to the heap leach, oxide material above 1.14 g t Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.60 g t Au reports to the mill.
5 The Herradura open pit mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 1.1 g t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model.
Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the open pit resource is 8.52 Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the open pit resource is 0.88 Moz.
6 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access.
SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions will be settled in favour of the mine.
7 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.5 g t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model.
Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the resource is 0.70Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the resource is 4K ounces.
8 The Noche Buena mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 g t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model.
Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the veins resource is 0.67 Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the resource is 0.05 Moz.
9 Includes Fresnillo Proao, Saucito, Cinega, San Julin and Herradura Vein deposits.
10 Includes the open pit portion of Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena deposits.
