146 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2014 7.
Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2014 13 Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 1,100 of the groups executive directors, senior managers and middle managers based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2014, shares allocated in 2011, 2012 and 2013 at 31st March 2013, shares allocated in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of underlying earnings per share EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
As a result of the share consolidation in August 2012, for the shares allocated in 2010, 2011 and 2012 to executive directors only, the performance conditions have been adjusted and so the minimum release requires EPS growth of 7% compound per annum and the maximum release requires EPS growth of 16% compound per annum.
Of the shares allocated in 2010, 100% were released during the year.
Share options In 2007 the LTIP was introduced and allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options.
No share options have been granted since the year ended 31st March 2007.
Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and were subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and approximately 800 employees were granted options each year.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 were subject to a minimum three year performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets were EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets were not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options would lapse.
The targets for options granted in 2004, 2005 and the 3% and 4% targets for options granted in 2006 have been met and so these options are exercisable.
The 5% target for options granted in 2006 was not met and so these options have lapsed.
Gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Deferred bonus In the year ended 31st March 2012 the bonus rules were changed for the executive directors and members of the Chief Executives Committee, whereby a proportion of their bonus payable is now awarded as shares and deferred for three years.
The first shares were awarded in August 2012 for the 2011 12 bonus and a further award was made in August 2013 for the 2012 13 bonus.
The Management Development and Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the deferred element in cases of misstatement or misconduct or other relevant reason as determined by it.
