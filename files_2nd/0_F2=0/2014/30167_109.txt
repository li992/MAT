Market risk Definition and exposure Market risk is the risk of areduction in earnings, value or reserves caused by changes in the prices of financial instruments.
Inaddition, market risk can arise as aresult of changes in customer behaviour, which may affect the maturity profiles of the Groups assets and liabilities.
The Groups market risk consists almost entirely of exposure to changes in interest rates, includingthe margin between customer and market rates.
This is the potential impact on earnings and value that could occur when, if rates fall, liabilities cannot be re-priced as quickly or by as much as assets: or when, if rates rise, assets cannot be re-priced as quickly or by as much as liabilities.
Management and measurement Risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily, net interest income and earnings sensitivity.
This methodology considers allre-pricing mismatches in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in net interest income that would result from asetof defined interest rate shocks.
Alimit structure exists to ensure that risks stemming from residual and temporary positions orfrom changes in assumptions about customer behaviour remain within the Groups risk appetite.
