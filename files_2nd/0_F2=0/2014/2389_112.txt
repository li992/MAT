Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, including an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next five years is agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
The minimum funding requirement therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $4,720 million at 31 December 2014.
There are no such minimum funding requirements after this seven-year period, and the obligation is taken into account in the determination of the amount of any pension plan surplus recognized on the balance sheet.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2014.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2011, and a valuation as at 31 December 2014 is currently under way.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.

Pensions continued Our discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
Our assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
Mortality assumptions % 2014 2013 2012 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 28.3 27.8 27.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.9 30.7 30.6 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.4 29.5 29.4 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.8 32.2 32.1 The assets of the principal plan are held in a trust.
The primary objective of the trust is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The fair values of the various categories of asset held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are set out below.
b Property held is all located in the United Kingdom.
The main pension plan does not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Some of the pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds over time, with a view to better matching of the asset portfolio with the pension liabilities.
The companys principal plan in the UK does not currently follow a liability driven investment approach, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in projected benefit obligations over time.
