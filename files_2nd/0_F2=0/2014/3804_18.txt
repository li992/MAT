The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by Level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 98 Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Parent Company financial statements Shareholder information 5 US DISPOSALS On 27 May 2014, the Group disposed of its retail cleaning business in the United States.
Total consideration for the transaction was 31 million, of which 24 million was received at closing in cash.
There was a loss of 1 million on the transaction and a gain of 2 million from other small US disposals.
In 2012 the Group disposed of the assets related to its food and support services business in correctional facilities located in the United States.
In the year ended 30 September 2013 a loss of 1 million was recognised in relation to this transaction.

Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of changes in statutory rates in the prior year related principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, 21% from 1 April 2014, and 20% from 1 April 2015.
These changes resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets were expected to reverse.

Of the total, tax losses of 27 million will expire at various dates between 2014 and 2022.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
The Group does not recognise any deferred tax liability on temporary differences relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries totalling 448 million 2013: 401 million because it is able to control the timing of reversal of these differences.
It is probable that no reversal will take place in the foreseeable future.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five year period.
Budgets and Forecasts are based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth, from both new business and organic growth and taking into consideration external economic factors.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for that country.

The impairment charge was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate applied as a result of increases in UK gilt rates and reflecting the normal year end review of the long term growth expectations.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill for all CGUs.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
There are no CGUs that are sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.

Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups client base.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables.
The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivable days for the continuing business at 30 September 2014 were 45 days 2013: 44 days.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 18: debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19: and equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent Company, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank, the public and the private placement markets.
The Group has developed long term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Groups policy is to match as far as possible its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are executed which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into sterling.
Where the borrowings are less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate variances are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
Non-sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups reported sterling financial position is exposed are the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen.
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of sterling against these currencies on the Groups financial statements is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
This table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Groups projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of 4 million 2013: loss of 1 million over the course of a year.
A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
CREDIT RISK The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives including forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognised agency.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 16.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
These interest rate swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.
CASH FLOW HEDGES The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 because the Group creates synthetic floating rate foreign currency borrowings see net investment hedges below through the use of forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps which IAS 39 disallows as being designated as a hedged item.
These interest rate swaps are an effective economic hedge against the exposure of the Groups floating rate borrowings to interest rate risk.
NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 2,519 million 2013: 1,464 million.
A foreign exchange gain of 41 million 2013: 50 million relating to the net investment hedges has been netted off within currency translation differences as presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
DERIVATIVES NOT IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward currency contracts.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 119 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2014 22 PROVISIONS CONTINUED Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short term and long term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Provisions for reorganisation include provision for redundancy costs and these are expected to be utilised over the next two years.
Other provisions include environmental provisions.
These are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
23 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS PENSION SCHEMES OPERATED The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 1% to 39% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 85 million 2013: 80 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK SCHEMES Within the UK there are now three main arrangements.
The Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP, the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan and the Companys stakeholder pension arrangement.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Chairman, Nigel Palmer, is a current employee of the Group and was appointed a Trustee Director on 30 May 2013.
The other five Trustee Directors are UK based employees of the Group, two of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
At the date of this Report, there is a vacancy for one further Member-Nominated Trustee Director.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
Those UK employees who transfer from the public sector under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 are eligible to join the Plan, which has otherwise been closed to new entrants since 2003.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan and are known as GAD members.
The Plan closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than GAD members, on 5 April 2010.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuation of the Plan took place as at 5 April 2013.
At the valuation date, the total market value of the assets of the Plan was 1,808 million which represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
By agreement with the Trustees, the Company has agreed to eliminate the 5 April 2013 deficit over a period of six years and three months to 31 December 2019 through monthly payments totalling 26 million per annum.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2016.
The Plan is reappraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 R Employee Benefits requirements.
The Plan has a Corporate Trustee.
The Chairman, Peter Morriss to 11 October 2013 and Phillip Whittome from 11 October 2013, and one other Trustee Director are independent.
There are a further five Trustee Directors who are either UK based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by Plan members.
The Company became subject to the Pensions Automatic Enrolment Regulations for its workforce in the UK on 1 November 2012 but, in accordance with the Regulations, deferred its staging date for automatic enrolment of eligible employees until 2 January 2013 in order to ensure that adequate systems were in place and employees were not impacted over the Christmas period.
Both the Plan and CRISP are compliant arrangements under these Regulations and have been registered as such.
Employees who are not already in one of these registered compliant arrangements have been automatically enrolled into the National Employment Savings Trust NEST.
The decision to appoint NEST as the Companys partner for automatic enrolment was made following a comprehensive selection process and the Company considers that NEST provides the right type of service, communication material and investment choice for our employees and that it has the capabilities to support a company as large and diverse as Compass.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 120 Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Parent Company financial statements Shareholder information 23 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED OVERSEAS SCHEMES In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland, the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes, the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 10 million in the year 2013: 10 million to these arrangements.
ALL DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES The Groups obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is then deducted.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high quality corporate bonds, that exactly matches the timing of the expected benefit payments over future years.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation.
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the income statement and balance sheet.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowances for projected earnings.
These calculations are performed by a qualified actuary.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.
These have been calculated on the following assumptions: UK schemes USA schemes Other schemes 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.0% 4.4% 3.9% 4.3% 2.5% 3.6% Inflation 3.2% 3.4% 2.3% 2.2% 1.7% 2.0% CPI inflation 2.45% 2.65% n a n a n a n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.2% 3.4% 3.0% 3.0% 1.7% 2.1% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.1% 3.3% 2.3% 2.2% 0.3% 0.5% Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.8% 3.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% This assumption is now presented as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and 0.6 year age adjustment for females, with a long term underpin of 1.25%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in the life expectancy of scheme members.
The Group estimates the average duration of the UK Plans liabilities to be 18 years 2013: 18 years.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2014 2013 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2014 2013 22.5 24.4 22.4 24.4 Member aged 65 in 2039 2038 24.8 26.9 24.7 26.8 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
The mortality assumptions used to value USA schemes are derived from the RP2000 combined healthy table, generational BB2D scale.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2014 2013 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2014 2013 20.9 23.3 19.2 21.0 Member aged 65 in 2039 2038 22.9 25.5 21.0 22.1 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 121 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2014 23 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED SENSITIVITIES OF PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including discount rate, life expectancy and inflation.
The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligations of the schemes are set out below: ASSUMPTION Change in assumption Impact on scheme deficit 2014 Impact on scheme deficit 2013 UK Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 170 million Decrease by 159 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 181 million Increase by 169 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 104 million Increase by 98 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 99 million Decrease by 94 million CPI Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 29 million Increase by 27 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 29 million Decrease by 27 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 55 million Increase by 49 million Life expectations annual improvement rate Increase by 0.25% per annum Increase by 26 million Increase by 22 million USA AND OTHER Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 18 million Decrease by 19 million Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 19 million Increase by 20 million Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 4 million Increase by 5 million Decrease by 0.5% Decrease by 4 million Decrease by 5 million Life expectations from age 65 Increase by 1 year Increase by 8 million Increase by 6 million The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligations as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption, although this is not always the case.
The impact of a change in the UK inflation rate shown above includes the impact of a change in both the RPI and CPI inflation rates.
The Groups net pension deficit is the difference between the schemes liabilities and the schemes assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the schemes liabilities but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of certain assets so there is no effect on the Groups liability.
ANALYSIS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS At 30 September 2014, the assets of the various schemes were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equities and debt securities.

The return on these investments is variable, and they are generally considered to be riskier investments.
However, it is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium to compensate investors for this additional risk.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
In respect of investments held in global equities there is also a risk of unfavourable currency movements.
The Trustee manages these risks by holding approximately 50% of those investments in funds which are hedged against currency movements.
The Trustee also holds corporate bonds and other fixed interest securities.
The risk of default on these is assessed by various rating agencies.
Some of these bond investments are issued by HM Government.
The risk of default on these is lower compared to the risk on corporate bond investments, although some risk may remain.

The executive and management options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.7 years 2013: 7.0 years.
In the year, options were granted on 29 November 2013 under the terms of the CSOP 2010.
The estimated fair value of options granted on these dates was 98.06 pence.
In 2013, options were granted on 22 November 2012 and 16 May 2013.
The estimated fair value of these options was 95.82 pence and 99.88 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under the CSOP 2010: ASSUMPTIONS OPTIONS 2014 2013 Expected volatility 15.3% 17.4% Risk free interest rate 1.8% 1.0% Dividend yield 2.6% 2.5% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 921.00p 875.49p Weighted average option exercise price 922.00p 869.56p Vesting of options awarded from October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the Adjusted Free Cash Flow AFCF target.
For options granted after 30 September 2006, 100% of the options will vest if the maximum target is met and a proportion of the awards will vest if the threshold target is met, as set out in the table shown below.

This performance condition is treated as a market based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability is built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
Vesting of a proportion of LTIP awards is dependent on the achievement of the cumulative three year AFCF target.
100% of that element of the award will vest if the maximum AFCF target is met, and a proportion of the award will vest if the threshold AFCF target is met, as set out in the table below.

The vesting probability of each element has been assessed based on a simulation model of the AFCF and ROCE improvement forecasts.
The AFCF performance targets relating to LTIP awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2009 and 1 October 2010 were met in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to the participants.
The element of awards made in the year commencing 1 October 2009 dependent upon TSR performance targets also vested in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to participants as the Companys TSR performance was within the top quartile of the comparator group.
For awards made in the year commencing 1 October 2010, the Companys TSR performance fell just outside the top quartile of the comparator group and as a result 96.1% of that element of the award vested.
The weighted average share price at the date of release for LTIP awards released during 2014 was 938.50 pence 2013: 720.51 pence.
The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years 2013: 1.1 years.
For the year ended 30 September 2014, LTIP awards were made on 29 November 2013 and 9 July 2014 for which the estimated fair value was 582.03 pence and 653.22 pence respectively.
For year ended 30 September 2013, LTIP awards were made on 12 February 2013 and 18 February 2013 for which the estimated fair value was 601.42 pence and 608.28 pence respectively.
These awards were all made under the terms of the 2010 LTIP.
The inputs to the option pricing model are reassessed for each award.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of LTIP awards made during the year: ASSUMPTIONS LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS 2014 2013 Expected volatility 15.5% 19.4% Risk free interest rate 0.7% 0.5% Dividend yield 2.4% 2.8% Expected life 2.9 years 2.6 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 986.23p 775.13p Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 128 Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial statements Parent Company financial statements Shareholder information 25 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED RESTRICTED SHARES The following table shows the movement in restricted share awards during the year: 2014 2013 Number Number RESTRICTED SHARES of shares of shares Outstanding at 1 October 118,353 119,206 Awarded 264,770 35,000 Vested and released 35,853 35,853 Outstanding at 30 September 347,270 118,353 Vested and available for release at 30 September 2014 2013 Number Number RESTRICTED SHARES PHANTOM AWARDS of shares of shares Outstanding at 1 October 52,460 52,460 Outstanding at 30 September 52,460 52,460 Vested and available for release at 30 September The phantom restricted shares were awarded on 25 November 2011 and will vest on 25 November 2014 subject to the achievement of a period of service performance conditions.
These awards are cash-settled and the fair value is reassessed at each balance sheet date.
The carrying amount as at 30 September 2014 is 0.5 million 2013: 0.3 million.
The fair value of restricted shares awarded in the year, including phantom awards, was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions: ASSUMPTIONS RESTRICTED SHARES 2014 2013 Expected volatility 15.3% 16.8% Risk free interest rate 0.7% 0.5% Dividend yield 2.6% 2.6% Expected life 2.4 years 1.6 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 923.08p 863.00p The weighted average share price at the date of release for restricted share awards released during 2014 was 997.93 pence 2013: 806.36 pence.
DEFERRED ANNUAL BONUS PLAN Certain senior executives participate in the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan.
Awards made before 30 September 2013 comprised two elements.
Payment of a portion of the annual bonus awarded to these executives is deferred for three years.
The amount released on expiry of the deferral period may be increased subject to achievement of organic revenue growth, profit growth and personal performance targets.
Any amount paid in cash must be immediately reinvested in ordinary shares of the Company which must then be held for a qualifying period.
The second element of the award reflects the growth in the Companys share price over the deferral period assuming that the deferred element of the annual bonus had been invested in ordinary shares of the Company at the start of the deferral period.
The fair value of the awards is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Any sum payable at the end of the deferral period is paid in cash.
The Group has recorded a liability of 2.5 million 2013: 1.2 million in respect of awards made before 30 September 2013 under this plan.
The terms of the plan were revised in 2014.
Payment of a portion of the annual bonus awarded to certain executives is converted into shares.
Subject to the achievement of organic revenue growth, cumulative PBIT and personal performance targets over the three year deferral period, the number of deferred shares may be increased.
Deferred shares are only released to the participants if minimum threshold performance levels are met.
A total of 285,040 deferred shares have been awarded which will vest in full if the maximum performance targets are met.
75% of the awards will vest if minimum threshold performance levels are met.
The fair value of these awards has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions: ASSUMPTIONS DEFERRED ANNUAL BONUS PLAN 2014 2013 Expected volatility 15.3% Risk free interest rate 0.7% Dividend yield 2.6% Expected life 3.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 921.00p Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2014 129 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2014 25 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED ACCELERATED GROWTH PLAN Contingent share awards under this plan have been awarded to the leadership team in certain countries in order to reward and encourage the growth of those businesses.
Vesting of these awards is subject to the achievement of local organic revenue growth, cumulative PBIT and personal performance targets over the three year period.
A total of 605,564 contingent shares were awarded in the year to 30 September 2014 of which 42,494 have subsequently lapsed.
The remaining 563,070 contingent shares will vest in full if the maximum performance targets are met.
50% of the awards will vest if minimum threshold performance levels are met.
No further awards were made in the year to 30 September 2014.
The fair value of these awards has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
LONG TERM BONUS PLAN Certain executives participating in the Long Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares.
The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following the completion of a further period of service.

PERFORMANCE BONDS, GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-indemnities in respect of such guarantees relating to the Groups own contracts and or the Groups share of certain contractual obligations of joint ventures and associates.
Where the Group enters into such arrangements, it does so in order to provide assurance to the beneficiary that it will fulfil its existing contractual obligations.

EUREST SUPPORT SERVICES On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has, however, not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.
OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce financial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings.
Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses.
In addition, the Group is subject to periodic tax audits and challenges with by various fiscal authorities covering corporate, employee and sales taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.
None of these are currently expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
OUTCOME Although it is not possible to predict the outcome or quantify the financial effect of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related thereto, in the opinion of the directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group.
The timing of the settlement of these proceedings or claims is uncertain.
