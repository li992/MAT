Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 30 Retirement benefit Obligations continued As at 26 December 2014, the market value of the plan assets was $4,972,000 27 December 2013: $10,049,000 and the net present value of the plan liabilities was $5,008,000 27 December 2013: $10,136,000.
The significant movement in both plan assets and plan liabilities can be attributed to a number of Israeli employees leaving the Group, and therefore also leaving the scheme, during the period.
This was largely due to the restructuring programme, announced in December 2013, as a result of the decision to discontinue the development of the Groups COACH platform.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current period is $0.4 million 2013: $1.4 million.

Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign Currency Risk Management Substantially all of the Groups sales and costs of sales are denominated in US dollars, the functional currency of all the entities within the Group.
A substantial proportion of the Groups xed costs are denominated in Sterling and a significant proportion of the remainder is non-USD denominated.
This exposure to different currencies may result in gains or losses with respect to movements in foreign exchange rates and the impact of such uctuations could be material.
Accordingly, the Group enters into hedging transactions pursuant to which it purchases Sterling under forward purchase contracts in order to cover the majority of its sterling exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 000 000 000 000 GBP sterling 11,748 6,249 11,006 7,837 The following significant exchange rates applied during the period: Weighted average forward contract rate contracts maturing in the period Period end spot rate 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 26 December 2014 27 December 2013 000 $000 000 $000 GBP: USD 1.5563 1.5744 1.5548 1.649 Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis A 10 percent strengthening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have decreased equity and profit or increased equity and profit by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.
com 125 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 31 Financial Instruments continued A 10 percent weakening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
The movement in profit for the period is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to exchange movements in sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the changes in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts The following table indicates the periods in which the cash ows associated with derivatives that are cash ow hedges are expected to occur: Carrying Expected 3 months More than Cash ow hedges amount cash ows or less 3-6 months 6-12 months one year 26 December 2014 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 86,250 17,250 17,250 34,500 17,250 Forward foreign exchange contracts $000 141,420 28,573 28,741 57,083 27,023 Fair value $000 7,635 1,765 1,962 3,633 275 Average exchange rate 1.6397 1.6564 1.6661 1.6546 1.5666 27 December 2013 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 67,000 16,750 16,750 33,500 Forward foreign exchange contracts $000 104,195 26,417 25,580 52,198 Fair value $000 6,171 1,198 2,028 2,945 Average exchange rate 1.5551 1.5771 1.5272 1.5581 The Directors consider the periods in which the cash ows associated with the derivatives that are cash ow hedges are expected to occur approximate the periods when the cash ows associated with those cash ows are likely to impact profit or loss.
Interest Rate Risk Management The Group has no significant direct exposure to uctuations in interest rates other than those on interest-bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at xed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those cash balances in the period was 0.15% 52 weeks ended 27 December 2013: 0.19%: 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012: 0.27%.
Credit risk Credit Risk Management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group only transacts with entities that are rated the equivalent of investment grade and above for Treasury management purposes.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
For cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, the Company only transacts with entities that are equivalent to investment grade and above.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are in note 18.
126 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Strategic report Governance Other information Financial statements Liquidity risk Liquidity Risk Management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its nonderivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables have been prepared based on undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Derivatives: The fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using an appropriate discount rate.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements approximates their fair values.
The following table provides an analysis of the financial assets, specically money market funds and marketable debt instruments that are measured on a recurring basis, subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset and liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The derivative instruments in designated hedging relationships, whose fair value includes the use of level 2 inputs, are valued with reference to the prevailing quoted forward exchange rate of the US Dollar to the British Pound Sterling at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the unquoted equity shares can be determined as management monitors the ongoing investment by oversight involvement in the investees and due to the recent nature of the purchase, by either the Group or other equity holders of the investees.
As a result of this oversight involvement, it was identied that Groups equity shareholding in one investee was fully impaired at 27 December 2013 and an impairment charge of $1.2 million was recognised accordingly.
The fair value of the contractual milestone payment was determined with reference to the likelihood of achieving contractual milestones, relating to the disposal of development operations in handset location and handset connectivity.
At 27 December 2013, the fair value of the probabilities of these possible circumstances and their outcomes were assessed, using forecast data available internally to the Group, and a liability of $5.0 million has been recognised accordingly.
This liability was paid during the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2014.
