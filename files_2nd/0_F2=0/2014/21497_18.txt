BREVAN HOWARD MASTER FUND LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 33 10.
Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk or concentration of credit risk continued BHIPL has formulated credit review policies that attempt to control credit risk by following an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of net exposure to individual counterparties, requiring the segregation of collateral where possible, and using master netting agreements whenever possible.
Liquidity risk The Master Funds and its Subsidiaries investment portfolios are leveraged and are actively managed to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to meet collateral calls, shareholder redemption requests and trading and other liabilities as they become due.
The Master Fund and its Subsidiaries seek to trade mainly in investments that are sufficiently liquid and readily realisable at close to fair value in order to meet any potential liquidity requirement.
To this end, the Master Fund and its Subsidiaries monitor the speed at which the portfolio can be liquidated under ordinary market conditions and further monitor liquidity by a number of additional measures.
Deteriorating market conditions, however, may hamper the ability of the Master Fund and its Subsidiaries to liquidate its investments in an orderly manner.
From time to time, market participants with which the Master Fund and its Subsidiaries effect transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain instruments, may only continue to do so in limited size, or may widen the spreads at which they are prepared to transact.
In such instances, the Master Fund and its Subsidiaries might be unable to enter into desired transactions, or close out existing transactions, at normal market levels, which might adversely affect its performance.
The Master Funds and its Subsidiaries liquidity risk is monitored on a daily basis by staff of the Investment Managers, independent of the portfolio management team, using measures of risk and unencumbered cash and cash equivalents, and includes an escalation process in circumstances where liquidity approaches tolerance levels.
The Master Fund and its Subsidiaries may restrict redemptions in accordance with their Articles of Association if they receive requests for the redemption of Shares on any Redemption Day representing in aggregate more than ten per cent of the total number of ordinary shares then in issue on a class by class basis.
Offsetting assets and liabilities The Master Fund and its Subsidiaries are required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets and liabilities represented in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognised assets and liabilities.
These recognised assets and liabilities are financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to either an enforceable master netting arrangement or a similar netting agreement in certain circumstances, for example in the event of default.
