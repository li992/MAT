Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2014 2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY continued Fair Value hierarchy classification In determining the level within the fair value hierarchy, set out in IFRS13, the Directors consider whether inputs to a fair value measurement are observable, and significant to its measurement.
This requires judgement based on the facts and circumstances around the published NAV of the underlying funds.
The Directors consider the availability of the NAV, at the reporting date, and whether holdings would be redeemable at such a NAV with evidence of redemptions at reporting date.
They also consider whether unobservable adjustments, such as liquidity discounts, have been made by the Company.
In the event there is any change in the above factors, a transfer between fair value hierarchy will be deemed to have occured and would be disclosed in Note 7.
