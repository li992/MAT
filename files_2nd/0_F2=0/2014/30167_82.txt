Repurchase agreements During the year, the Group established capability to undertake repurchase agreements in order to provide additional flexibility to raise short term cash from the financial markets.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into repurchase agreements which transferred the legal title of certain gilts, in return for cash, together with an agreement to repurchase the gilts at a later date and at a predetermined price.
The gilts were not derecognised from the Groups balance sheet as substantially all of the rewards, including interest income on the gilts, and risks, including credit and interest rate risks, are retained by the Group.
In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the gilts concerned, subject to delivering equivalent securities at the repurchase date.
The table below presents the carrying values of the transferred gilts and the associated repurchase agreement liabilities.
The associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets see note 2.

Fair value of financial liabilities The following table summarises the carrying values of financial liabilities presented on the Groups balance sheet.
The fair values presented in the table are at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement date.

Fair value is the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As quoted market prices are not available for the Groups financial instruments, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
