Other intangible assets acquired relates to order book, leases and technology based assets.
All intangible assets have finite useful lives except for goodwill.
The remaining useful lives at 31 August 2014 are approximately 1 to 13 years in respect of brands and trademarks, less than 1 year to 13 years in respect of customer relationships and 1 to 4 years in respect of non-compete agreements.
For 2014, the impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets acquired relates to Australian Conveyor Engineering, Allison, Fenner Precision Buffalo, Xeridiem and Conveyor Belting India.
These impairments were triggered by a reduction in the projected cash flows in these cash-generating units.
These are classified within exceptional items in the Consolidated income statement.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as follows: 2014 2013 m m Engineered Conveyor Solutions Fenner Dunlop Americas, Europe and Australia 14.

140.0 2 The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used to determine the value in use relate to profits derived from sales volumes, selling prices and costs, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
Cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts for a period of three years which have been approved by Group management.
The principal components of these forecasts: sales volumes, selling prices and costs, are based on recent history and expected future changes in operating conditions.
Cash flows beyond a period of three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
These rates range from 2.0% to 3.7% for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 6.4% has been applied.
Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax cost of capital for each respective territory.
A range of discount rates between 9.6% to 12.7% were used for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 18.8% was used.
The discount rates reflect the risk profiles in the respective territories.
The above assumptions apply to all of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2014 88 Strategic Report Directors Report Financial Results Impairments charged in the year to the Consolidated income statement are as follows: Intangible assets acquired Brands and Customer Non-compete Goodwill trademarks relationships agreements Total m m m m m Engineered Conveyor Solutions Conveyor Belting India 0.5 - - - 0.5 Allison 4.3 - 7.3 0.7 12.3 Australian Conve yor Engineering 5.3 0.1 1.7 0.1 7.2 10.1 0.1 9.0 0.8 20.0 Advanced Engineered Products Fenner Precision Buffalo 1.4 - 0.9 - 2.3 Xeridiem 0.2 - 1.5 - 1.7 1.6 - 2.4 - 4.0 11.7 0.1 11.4 0.8 24.0 Whilst management believes that the assumptions used in testing for impairments are realistic, it is possible that variations in key assumptions could affect the recoverable amount of cash-generating units.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed by varying these key assumptions, individually, whilst holding other variables constant.
At 31 August 2014, there is significant headroom between the carrying amounts and recoverable amounts for all cash-generating units, except for those impaired in the year and Statewide Belting Service.
For cash-generating units impaired in the year, the effect of changes in assumptions on the recoverable amounts, together with the actual recoverable amounts, are as follows: Increase decrease in recoverable amount Discount rate Growth rate Projected cash flows Recoverable 1% increase 1% decrease 1% increase 1% decrease 5% increase 5% decrease amount m m m m m m m Conveyor Belting India 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.2 3.0 0.1 Allison 0.8 0.6 0.6 0.3 0.5 6.4 0.3 Australian Conveyor Engineering 2.1 1.7 1.8 0.8 1.4 16.7 0.8 Fenner Precision Buffalo - - - - - - - Xeridiem 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.2 1.4 0.1 Fenner Precision Buffalo was fully impaired in the year.
For Statewide Belting Service, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by 0.6m.
If either the units projected cash flows were to reduce by 6%, the growth rate were to reduce by 0.7% or the discount rate were to increase by 0.6%, then this would result in the units recoverable amount being less than its carrying amount.
Headroom between the carrying amounts and recoverable amounts for all cash-generating units, except for those impaired in the year and Statewide Belting Service, is in excess of 37%.
