Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements General Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2014, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 2March 2015.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 87 to 92.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position, low level of debt, continued growth and forecast profitability.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Note 3 contingent consideration and remuneration on acquisitions Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including the capitalisation of software and development costs Note 13 revenue recognition Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and equity account the Groups interest in associates.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Accounting for business combinations From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Any contingent amount payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent amount is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent amount are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it shall be treated as a cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007.
These comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixons 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited from third parties.
The acquisition of Simon Nixons shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction.
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages.
This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign subsidiary icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life, is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Non-compete agreement 4 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in IAS 38.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair values of the share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.
Costs associated with the production of adverts are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.
The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs Finance costs comprise of interest charged on borrowings, and the unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
The effective interest rate method is then used for subsequent re-measurement of borrowings at amortised cost.
The unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an interest expense.
Operating leases Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the relevant lease.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which are acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 as a government grant.
The credit is recognised once a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves where applicable, as well as unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by where possible depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
The Group has made a net repayment of 30m on its revolving credit facility in the year, with 30m remaining drawn down on the facility at 31 December 2014.
The Group is subject to externally imposed quarterly covenants as a result of this facility which are based on EBITDA, interest and net debt.
None of these covenants were breached in the year, nor are expected to be breached within 12 months of the date of these Financial Statements.
Management of capital focuses around the Groups ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period The Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the Groups results: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 2011 IFRS 11 Joint ventures 2011 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities 2011 IAS 27 Separate financial statements revised 2011 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures revised 2011 IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group.
These are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups accounts when adopted, except where stated.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 2010 On 28 October 2010, the IASB published a revised version of IFRS 9 Financial instruments.
The revised standard retains the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets that were published in November 2009 but adds guidance on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
As part of its restructuring of IFRS 9, the IASB also copied the guidance on derecognition of financial instruments and related implementation guidance from IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement to IFRS 9.
On 19 November 2011, the IASB issued Mandatory effective date and Transition Disclosures.
IFRS 9 has not yet been adopted by the EU and the effective date is currently unknown.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customer 2014 T he standard applies to an entitys first annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
com MSE On 21 September 2012, the Group acquired certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis and his company MoneySavingExpert.
Additional amounts of up to 27.0m may become payable on the third anniversary of the completion of the acquisition.
The amount payable depends in part upon the achievement of a number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement and is, in part, at the discretion of the Companys Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts has been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration as their payment is linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services are provided the earnout period as an employment expense.
Management has estimated the benefit payable by assessing, amongst other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase agreement.
Measurement is inherently subjective due to the nature of the earnout variables, for which, in one case the measurement period has not yet started, or is in the early stages for other variables.
Due to this subjectivity, the eventual amount payable could be different depending upon a number of outcomes.
However, the amount accrued at December 2014 is currently managements best estimate of the likely outcome at this stage.
During the year 3.9m 2013: 8.0m has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an employment expense, and 0.3m 2013: 0.6m has been recognised as an expense within net finance costs, being the unwinding of the discount rate applied.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

78 MONEYSUPERMARKET ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements General 12.
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group.
At 31 December 2014 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% 2013: more than 100%.
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units CGU that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8.
These CGUs are the five operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.
The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level.
For the original four segments, the goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with 30.7m allocated to Insurance, 15.5m to Money, 6.6m to Travel and 2.2m to Home Services.
The balances at 31 December 2014 are inline with those at 1 January 2009.
Goodwill impairment for MSE has been considered separately from the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 for each CGU represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2014, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2015 incorporating cost of sales, advertising and an allocation of overhead costs.
The main assumptions underlying the 2015 budget relate to visitor volumes, source of visitors, revenue per transaction visitor and marketing spend, which incorporate past experience.
The forecast assumes continued growth during the course of 2015, broadly in line with that seen in 2014, driven by new media campaigns, exploitation of the Groups data asset and further investments made during 2014 in the core technology underpinning the Groups key channels.
Cash flows for the second and third years assume revenue growth of approximately 10% per annum in the Money and Travel segments, with a higher rate of growth in the Home Services segment, and a lower rate of growth in the Insurance segment.
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with revenues.
Cash flows after three years assume no growth.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% 2013: 13.5% has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services segments.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macro-economic environment.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.

Intangible assets continued As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment.
Therefore the cash flows estimated for these segments include all of the Groups forecast revenues and an allocation of the Groups forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous years.
In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows, which has been calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Groups assets exceeds their carrying value by 656m 2013: 444m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment 2013: same.
At an asset category level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
In relation to the spend on technology related assets, management believe that the expenditure incurred will generate future economic benefits for the Group.
They consider that the assets are not yet sufficiently mature to assess their carrying amount at anything other than the carrying value shown in the financial statements, being cost less accumulated depreciation which is charged to write off the assets over a three year period.

com The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cashflows using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2014, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2015.
The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business.
The forecast assumes an improvement during 2015, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation.
Cash flows for the first three years assume an average 10% per annum increase in revenue, with costs expected to grow at around 10% per annum.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% 2013: 16.2% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by 51m 2013: 24m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
The discount rate would need to increase to 28% 2013: 22% with all other assumptions held constant, to give a value in use of MSEs assets equal to the carrying value.
Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash flows of 9.0m 2013: 4.0m with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use equal to the carrying value.

As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, there is an element of subjectivity in calculating a revenue accrual as a result of estimating the number of successful applications on the providers website in the period between the last date of billing and the latest provider data being made available.
This revenue accrual can typically represent approximately one months revenue.
The accrued revenue is estimated by considering the volume of clicks that have passed from the Groups websites through to provider websites in the period, the historic conversion of such clicks into completed product purchases, and contracted revenue per transaction.
From historical experience and post year end confirmation, the Group expects any differences between the amounts accrued at year end and those amounts subsequently billed to be not materially different.
At 31 December 2014, trade receivables are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts of 213,000 2013: 122,000, which represents a judgement made by management of which receivables balances are unlikely to be recovered taking into consideration the ageing of the debt, evidence of poor payment history or financial position of a particular debtor.

Fair values The Groups financial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different from their carrying value.
The valuation method for the Groups financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risks, are set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000 000 Unsecured bank loan facilities with a maturity date of 30 September 2016 amount used 30,000 60,000 amount unused 30,000 10,000 During the year, a net repayment of 30,000,000 was made against the banking facility.
