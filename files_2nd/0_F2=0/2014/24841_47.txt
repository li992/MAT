Related Party Transactions The Investment Adviser to the Company and the Operator of a limited partnership through which the Consolidated Group holds its investments is InfraRed Capital Partners Limited IRCP.
IRCPs appointment as Investment Adviser is governed by an Investment Advisory Agreement which may be terminated by either party giving one years written notice.
The appointment may also be terminated if IRCPs appointment as Operator is terminated.
The Investment Adviser is entitled to a fee of 0.1 million per annum disclosed within investment fees in Note 6 2013: 0.1 million, payable half-yearly in arrears and which is subject to review, from time to time, by the Company.
Related Party Transactions continued IRCP has been appointed as the Operator of Infrastructure Investments Limited Partnership by the General Partner of the Partnership, Infrastructure Investments General Partner Limited, a sister subsidiary of IRCP.
The Operator and the General Partner may each terminate the appointment of the Operator by either party giving one years written notice.
Either the Operator or the General Partner may terminate the appointment of the Operator by written notice if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
The General Partners appointment does not have a fixed term, however if IRCP ceases to be the Operator, the Company has the option to buy the entire share capital of the General Partner and IRCP Group has the option to sell the entire share capital of the General Partner to the Company, in both cases for nominal consideration.
The Directors consider the value of the option to be insignificant.
In the year to 31 March 2014, in aggregate IRCP and the General Partner were entitled to fees and or profit share equal to: i 1.1 per cent per annum of the adjusted gross asset value of all investments of the Consolidated Group that are not in either their construction or rampup phases up to 750 million, 1.0 per cent per annum for the incremental value in excess of 750 million up to 1,500 million and 0.9 per cent for the incremental value in excess of 1,500 million: ii 1.5 per cent per annum of investments of the Consolidated Group that are in either their construction or ramp-up phases, excluding investments acquired with the acquisition of the initial portfolio the ramp-up phase of an investment means the period following completion of a projects construction phase during which it is building up to be fully operational with full service provision : and iii 1.0 per cent of the value of new portfolio investments, that were not sourced from entities, funds or holdings managed by the IRCP Group.
In March 2014 the Company announced that from 1 April 2014, IRCP and the General Partner will in aggregate be entitled to fees and or profit share equal to: i 1.1 per cent per annum of the adjusted gross asset value of all investments of the Consolidated Group up to 750 million, 1.0 per cent per annum for the incremental value in excess of 750 million up to 1,500 million, 0.9 per cent for the incremental value in excess of 1,500 million up to 2,250 million and 0.8 per cent for the incremental value in excess of 2,250 million.
The Consolidated Group has therefore ceased to pay the differentiated and higher annual management fee for assets in construction previously 1.5% p. a., so that the fee payable will be the same for all investments, regardless of whether they are operational, in rampup or under construction.
The total Operator fees charged to the Consolidated Income Statement was 14.9 million 2013: 11.2 million of which 7.8 million remained payable at year end 2013: 5.9 million.
The total charge for new portfolio investments disclosed within investment fees in Note 6 was 2.2 million 2013: 1.7 million of which 0.5 million remained payable at year end 2013: 1.0 million.
