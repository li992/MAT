19 Share-based payments Fidessa has share plans whereby employees are granted awards over ordinary shares subject to the vesting of their awards in accordance with the terms of each plan.
The PSP, DABP and MSPP were approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Each plan was approved by 99% of the votes cast and no votes were withheld.
The MSPP and, in the UK, the award of matching shares under the SIP were implemented in 2012 and are relevant to the majority of employees.
The first award under the DABP was made in 2012 and the first award under the PSP was made in 2014.
These plans replaced the CSOP, EGRIP and SBP from which the last awards were in 2010.
Performance Share Plan PSP This is structured as a grant of conditional shares with a zero exercise price.
The maximum for an employee in any year are awards over shares with a total market value of 500,000.
The vesting period is four years from the date of grant.
The awards vest based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, which requires the cumulative four year adjusted basic earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying the annual growth rates in the table below to the base earnings per share year preceding date of grant.
At the lower threshold, 25% of an award vests with a straight-line scale to 100% vesting at the higher threshold.
