Segmental Information This note is presented according to the management structure and internal reporting that Serco has put in place for 2015 as a result of actions from the Corporate Renewal Programme and the Strategy Review.
The former segments, as reported in 2014 to the Board, is provided in note 42.
The UK Central Government division is now a separate unit which brings together Sercos work for the UK Central Government: it also brings together all Transport operations, including those for devolved authorities that were previously included in the UK and Europe Local and Regional Government division.
The UK and Europe Local and Regional Government division now incorporates public sector BPO operations previously included in the Global Services division, together with Citizen Services previously included in the Central Government division: all public sector BPO operations are therefore now brought together in this division.
The AMEAA region is now reported as two separate divisions AsPac the Asia Pacific region, consisting principally of Sercos operations in Australia and New Zealand and the Middle East.
Americas remains as a distinct regional division.
The Global Services division now consists of BPO operations only in the private sector.
The Group has simplified its reporting by ending the sharing of Income Statement reporting of certain contracts between two segments.
This shared reporting of contracts occurred predominantly between the AsPac and UK segments, with these contracts now being solely reported within the segment that delivers the contract to the end customer.
Going forward, eliminating the shared Income Statement reporting of such contracts will increase the transparency and clarity of our segmental performance reporting.
The prior year comparative segmental information has been restated to reflect these changes.
