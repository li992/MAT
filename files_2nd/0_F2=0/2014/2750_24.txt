Maturity analysis All of the Companys financial liabilities have a maturity of less than one year 2013: less than one year.
7.6 Investments in Subsidiaries Accounting policy The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is based on the discounted future net cash flows of oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period.
For exploration assets, estimated discounted cash flows are risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price based on the forward curve and long-term oil price of US$90 per boe 2013: long-term oil price of US$90 per boe, escalation for prices and costs of 2.5%, and a discount rate of 10% 2013: 2.5% and 10% respectively.
Full details on the assumptions used for valuing oil and gas assets can be found in section 2.
