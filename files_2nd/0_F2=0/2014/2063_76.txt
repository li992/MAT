24 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS In the year ended 31 December 2014, a number of the Groups UK employees were members of the BG Pension Scheme BGPS, a defined benefit registered pension plan established under trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The BGPS is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the closure of the scheme.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis ofwhich the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the returns on the BGPSs assets, areexpected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
In common with all workplace pension schemes in the UK, the BGPS is subject to regulation by The Pensions Regulator.
The Trustee is responsible for overall management and governance of the BGPS, including compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations.
The Trustee also has responsibility for investment of the BGPSs assets, following consultation with the Group.
The BGPS closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013 and all active members became deferred pensioners with pensions calculated based on salaries up until the point of closure for such active members.
These deferred pensions are generally revalued in line with movements inthe Retail Prices Index.
Certain benefits relating to individual transfers-in and purchases of additional pensionable service by employees retain alink to pensionable salary post-closure.
The closure of the scheme to future accruals resulted in a curtailment gain of $154m, recognised in the 2013 income statement see note 4, page 105.
The last full independent actuarial valuation of the BGPS for funding purposes showed that the aggregate market value of the plan assets at 31March 2014 was 1 540m, representing 97% of the accrued liabilities.
The next full funding valuation is expected to be performed with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
As part of the funding agreement in respect of the 2011 actuarial valuation and the closure of the BGPS to future accrual of benefits, the Group and the Trustee established a Pension Funding Partnership PFP to address the deficit and to provide greater securityto the Trustee.
In December 2013, the Group acquired an interest in the PFP for 110m.
It also contributed 350m to the BGPS and the Trustee used this to purchase itsinterest in the PFP.
The PFP has an interest in loans secured on four of the Groups LNG ships, the proceeds from which the PFP will use to make annual distributions of 33m to the BGPS for 15 years and to pay a capital sum in 2028 of 172m which will be used, if necessary, to fund any deficit inthe BGPS at that time, measured on a self-sufficiency funding basis.
In December 2014, BG Group entered into an agreement for the sale oftwoof these LNG ships for proceeds of $460 million.
Consequently, the majority of the proceeds from this sale will be utilised to support the funding of the BGPS.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the PFP are not required to be, andhave not been, filed at Companies House.
For scheme funding purposes, the Trustees interest in the PFP is treated as an asset which reduces the BGPS actuarial funding deficit.
However, thePFP is not a plan asset under IAS 19 for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and therefore does not reduce the deficiton an IAS 19 accounting basis.
The Group is exposed to a number of risks relating to the BGPS.
For example, additional contributions may be required if the life expectancy ofthemembers increases or if investments underperform, compared with the assumptions adopted at the last valuation of the BGPS.
The BGPS holds a diversified investment portfolio see table on page 129, primarily comprising quoted investments, spread across five investment managers.
The portfolio remains weighted towards growth assets, with the benchmark allocation to these assets maintained at 60% during the year.
As at 31 December 2014, the BGPS held unquoted assets valued at $4m 2013: $3m through its absolute return investment in the Lansdowne Developed Markets Fund.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS provides benefits broadly in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This defined benefit plan is anunfunded, non-registered arrangement.
The BGSBS was closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013, the same date as benefit accrual ceased in the BGPS.
BG GROUP | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 128 24 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED The Group has a small number of defined benefit plans outside the UK which are not material in Group terms.
Independent actuaries reported on the financial position of the BGPS and the BGSBS as at 31 December 2014 in accordance with the requirements ofIAS 19.
The fair value of plan assets, the present value of plan liabilities and the net balance sheet liability were as follows: as at 31 December 2014 2013 $m $m Fair value of plan assets 2 004 1 927 Present value of liabilities 2 262 2 095 Net balance sheet liability 258 168 The following table shows the movements in the defined benefit obligation DBO, the fair values on plan assets and the net defined benefit obligation in the period, separately identifying the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income: 2014 2013 $m $m Defined Fair values Net defined Defined Fair values Net defined benefit on plan benefit benefit on plan benefit obligation assets obligation obligation assets obligation At 1 January 2 095 1 927 168 1 886 1 598 288 Pension cost credit to income statement: Current service cost 63 63 Past service cost 15 15 Curtailment gain 154 154 Net interest 92 85 7 83 72 11 Subtotal recognised in the income statement: 77 85 8 8 72 80 Remeasurement gains losses in other comprehensive income: Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest 119 119 158 158 Actuarial changes arising from changes in financial assumptions 225 225 210 210 Actuarial changes arising from changes in demographic assumptions 75 75 Experience adjustments 18 18 4 4 Currency translation adjustments 124 116 8 55 47 8 Subtotal recognised in Other Comprehensive Income: 158 3 155 261 205 56 Benefits paid 68 68 45 45 Contributions by employees 1 1 Contributions by employer 57 57 96 96 At 31 December 2 262 2 004 258 2 095 1 927 168 Also recognised in the consolidated income statement was a $73m charge 2013: $60m in relation to defined contribution schemes within continuing operations and $nil 2013: $1m within discontinued operations.
As at 31 December 2014, $2 187m of the DBO relates to the funded BGPS 2013: $2 021m and $75m relates to the unfunded BGSBS 2013: $74m.
The weighted average duration of the DBO as at 31 December 2014 is 22 years.
As at 31 December 2014, $1 554m of the DBO relates to deferred pensioners and $708m relates to pensions in payment.
a The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following significant assumptions : 2014 2013 % % b Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.1 3.4 Discount rate 3.7 4.5 a Due to the closure of the BGPS to future accrual of benefits on 31 December 2013 the future increase in earnings is no longer considered a significant assumption.
b Rate of increase of the majority of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
The assumptions set out in the table above are those applicable to Pounds Sterling, being the currency in which the plans are denominated.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BGPS and BGSBS was reduced by 0.1% to 3.6%, the DBO would increase by $49m.
A 0.1% increase inthe inflation rate would have a similar impact on the DBO.
BG GROUP | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 129 24 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED In determining the DBO as at 31 December 2014, mortality assumptions are based on the Self Administered Pension Schemes SAPS S2 series light tables with a 98% multiplier for males and a 91% multiplier for females issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to each members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMIs core projection model 2013 version, with a long-term rate of improvement of the projected mortality rates of 1.5% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in 10 years time are as follows: Life expectancy of pensioners years as at 31 December 2014 2013 2014 2024 2013 2023 Male age 60 28.8 30.0 28.3 29.0 Male age 65 23.9 24.9 23.6 24.2 Female age 60 30.6 31.8 29.4 30.2 Female age 65 25.6 26.8 24.6 25.4 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the DBO inrespect of the BGPS and BGSBS would increase by $61m.
