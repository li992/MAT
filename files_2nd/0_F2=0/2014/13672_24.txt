Basis of preparation This note explains how these Royal Mail plc Group the Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared, including details of the incorporation of Royal Mail plc the Company, specific items, the adjustment to the comparative year relating to the transfer of Post Office Limited POL to Royal Mail Holdings plc on 1 April 2012, and the adjustment for the 53rd week in 2012-13.
Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs The consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board on 6June 2014 and the balance sheet as at 30 March 2014 was signed on behalf of the Directors by Moya Greene and Matthew Lester.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2014 2013 53weeks ended 31March 2013.
Basis of preparation and accounting The incorporation of Royal Mail Limited on 6 September 2013, subsequently re-registered as Royal Mail plc the Company on 19September 2013, has resulted in the Company becoming the immediate and ultimate parent of Royal Mail Group Limited see note 10 for further details.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore presented for Royal Mail plc and its subsidiaries, whereas the 2012-13 Annual Report and Special Purpose Financial Statements Annual Report and Prospectus in relation to the Initial Public Offering of Royal Mail plc, dated 27September 2013 the Prospectus were in respect of consolidated Royal Mail Group Limited.
Accordingly, all references to the 2012-13 Annual Report and Prospectus in this document relate to the consolidated Royal Mail Group Limited entity.
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom UK and the financial statements are produced in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable IFRSs.
The UK is the Companys country of domicile.
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates, and all values are rounded to the nearest whole million except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historic cost basis, except for pension assets and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fairvalue.
The results of POL have been consolidated and disclosed as a discontinued operation in the income statement for the period 26 March 2012 up to 1 April 2012, at which point POL was transferred to Royal Mail Holdings plc subsequently renamed Postal Services Holding Company Limited.
Presentation of results The Groups significant accounting policies can be found after the notes to these Group financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs i. e. on a Reported basis.
The income statement and cash flow statement also include non-GAAP adjustments in respect of the following: Specific items The Group previously disclosed items that in managements judgement needed to be shown separately by virtue of their nature as exceptional items.
There are, however, other items of income expense, after operating profit after transformation costs that management now discloses separately, which do not ordinarily meet the definition of exceptional items e. g. finance income on the sale of pension escrow gilts, net pension interest and elements of taxation.
The Group has decided, therefore, not to continue using the exceptional items definition and instead to refer tosuch items of income expense as specific items.
This new definition has been introduced on the basis that the financial results excluding these specific items are consistent with how financial and operational performance is measured by management in providing a meaningful analysis of the Groups trading results and cash flows.
These specific items may not be comparable with similarly-termed measures used by other companies.
Items which are classified as specific are: RMPP Royal Mail RM section see note 8 amendment credit, transaction-related costs, Employee Free Shares costs, certain costs not associated with the transformation of the operational network, historical employment costs, potential industrial diseases claims costs, certain property impairments, all profits from disposals of property and associate undertakings, net pension interest, the gain created on the sale of pension escrow investments, plus the related taxation effects of these items.
Taxation specific items include the impact of the pension transfer pursuant to the Postal Services Act 2011 and the impact of changes in taxation law.
Impact of 53rd week in 2013 The 2012-13 comparative year was a 53 week year and, to provide meaningful comparisons of revenues and costs, the income statement also includes comparative results on an Adjusted 52 week basis.
The adjustment eliminates the 53rd weeks revenue and incremental operating costs associated with that revenue.
GLS reports results for a 52 week year ending 31 March.
No adjustment has therefore been made for GLS.
Transfer of Post Office Limited POL The 2012-13 comparative Reported results in these financial statements relate to the 53 week year ended 31 March 2013 and include the full consolidated results of the Group, including the Groups former subsidiary, POL, for the period 26 March 2012 to 31 March 2012.
POL wassubsequently transferred to Royal Mail Holdings plc on 1 April 2012.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued The 2012-13 comparative Adjusted results in the income statement exclude POL, and are consistent with those presented in the Prospectus, with an adjustment to eliminate the 53rd weeks revenue and costs 37 million profit impact see above and page F66 in the Prospectus.
In excluding POL from these comparative results, costs incurred by the Group relating to the transfer of POL 20 million IT separation costs and 12 million loss on transfer of properties were deemed, for the purpose of providing Royal Mail Group excluding POL financial information, to be external, third party costs and were taken directly to the income statement.
On a Reported basis, these 32 million costs of POL separation have been treated, as required by IFRSs, as transactions with the parent at the time Royal Mail Holdings plc and taken directly through equity included in Loss on transfer of subsidiary to parent Company discontinued operation in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, not through the income statement.
Consequently, the Reported profit for the period from continuing operations is 32 million higher than that in the Adjusted results, in addition to the 37 million higher profit impact of the 53rd week as explained above.
The comparative information in the consolidated statement of cash flows also includes non-GAAP disclosures which exclude the cash position of POL up to the date of its transfer to Royal Mail Holdings plc.
The Directors believe that this presentation provides meaningful comparisons of cash flows and is consistent with how the cash flow statement was presented in the 2012-13 Annual Report and the Prospectus.
Other than the discontinued operation disclosure in the income statement and the Reported cash flows in the cash flow statement, on the basis of materiality, no other disclosures e. g. segment reporting in respect of POL have been made in these financial statements, for the period that itwas still part of the Group.
Merger transaction of Royal Mail plc and Royal Mail Group Limited As part of the Group reorganisation prior to the Initial Public Offering of shares, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Royal Mail Group Limited through issuance of its shares to the then parent Company, Royal Mail Holdings plc subsequently renamed Postal Services Holding Company Limited.
As there were no changes to the shareholder group at the time of this transaction and Royal Mail plc is not a business, this transaction did not classify as a business combination as defined under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The consolidated financial statements ofRoyal Mail plc have therefore been prepared as a continuation of the existing Group.
Going concern The Groups business activities, strategy and performance are outlined on pages 2 to 37.
In assessing the going concern status of the Group, the Directors are required to look forward by a minimum of 12 months from the end of the reporting year, 30 March 2014, to ensure that there is sufficient headroom determined by available cash and cash equivalents plus available unrestricted unused committed facilities to enable the Group to pay its creditors as they fall due.
Notes 5 and 16 of these financial statements provide details of the Groups current loan structure and level of borrowings at 30 March 2014.
The Group also has finance lease obligations of 342 million at 30 March 2014 as shown in note 28 to the financial statements.
Letters of Credit of 112 million have been provided by the Group in support of certain leasing and insurance obligations.
However, as these are currently uncollateralised, they are not included as part of reported net debt.
Further details are provided in the Financial review on page 27.
The Directors have undertaken a review of, and expect to continue to review, the Groups cash headroom over a longer timeframe than the minimum requirement, under various downside scenarios.
The Directors have concluded from their review that, under the various downside scenarios, sufficient cash headroom exists for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Segment information The Groups revenue, certain costs and profit before financing and taxation are segmented in this note, aligned with how the business is managed.

Segment information continued The Group is structured on a geographic business unit basis and these business units report into the Chief Executives Committee and the Royal Mail plc Board.
Each of these units has discrete revenue, costs, profit, cash flows, assets and people.
Therefore, full and complete financial information is prepared and reviewed on a regular basis and compared with both historical and budget forecast information as part of a rigorous performance management process.
In addition to providing segmental disclosures for profit after taxation, consistent with the requirements of accounting standards and how the Group is managed, the information below also includes details of free cash flow and EBITDA before transformation costs.
The majority of inter-segment revenue relates to the provision of facilities management and catering services to UKPIL.
Trading between UKPIL and GLS is not material.
Transfer prices between the segments are set on a basis of charges reached through commercial negotiation with the respective business units that form part of the segments.

2 The taxation credit shown in specific items for 2012-13 reflects the benefit of UK taxation attributes including prior year taxation losses and deferred capital allowances not previously recognised as deferred taxation assets.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that the Group is expected to have future taxable profits and therefore obtain a real taxation saving from future taxation deductions.
Following the Postal Services Act 2011 and the transfer of almost all of the RMPPs historic pension liabilities and pension assets, expectations of future profitability increased and it became appropriate to recognise a net deferred taxation asset in the UK.
In addition to this one-off material deferred taxation credit, the Group also reported a one-off benefit from the utilisation of prior year taxation losses in 2012-13.

As finance leases are currently at a similar interest rate to loans, the impact of finance leases on the blended interest rate is not material.
Under the previous HM Government facilities, the equivalent blended interest rate was 8.8 per cent.

GLS pays taxation in a number of territories, with the majority of its profits in the period to 30 March 2014 earned in territories where the taxation rate is above the UK statutory taxation rate.
Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, are not at this stage able to recognise taxation credits on losses made during the period and this contributes to GLS having a higher effective taxation rate for the period than the UK business.
Current taxation Substantially all of the current taxation due for the Group for the period is in respect of GLS.
UK taxable profits in 2013-14 are almost fully covered by a combination of brought forward losses, capital allowance claims and a statutory deduction in respect of shares allocated to employees under the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved Employee Free Shares Offer.
Owing to the above items and the RMPP RM section amendment credit, which does not give rise to a current taxation charge, the current taxation rate for the Group is two per cent.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 85 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Taxation continued Deferred taxation The UK deferred taxation liability is a net amount comprising a number of taxation assets and liabilities which will reverse in future periods.
The UK position has changed from a net deferred taxation asset at 31 March 2013 to a net deferred taxation liability at 30 March 2014, primarily due to the effects of the Pensions Reform in the year.
The pension surplus created as a result of the Pensions Reform gives rise to a deferred taxation liability that is expected to reverse over a much longer period than the other deferred taxation assets and liabilities.
The RMPP RM section amendment credit of 1,350 million, included in profit before taxation, generates the majority of the deferred taxation charge in the income statement, whilst the decrease in the pension surplus due to actuarial revaluation gives rise to a deferred taxation credit of 117 million inthe consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
A new UK deferred taxation liability arises in 2013-14 in relation to the HMRC-approved Employee Free Shares Offer.
As an HMRC-approved share incentive plan, a full taxation deduction is given for the value of the shares in the period in which they are first allocated to employees, whereas the accounting charge accrues over the life of the scheme.
To the extent that the taxation deduction exceeds UK taxable profits in the period, the taxation losses carried forward are increased.
The deferred taxation balances within GLS arise in various jurisdictions, with reversal at varying times and rates and so balances in different jurisdictions are not offset against one another.
Under the Postal Services Act 2011, UK trading losses which arose due to employers pension contributions paid which were unused at 31March 2013 are extinguished.
Losses and deferred taxation assets carried forward are stated above, net of the extinguished amount.
At 30 March 2014, the Group had unrecognised deferred taxation assets of 63 million 2013 66 million comprising 63 million 2013 54million relating to taxation losses, mainly in GLS, that are available for offset and nil 2013 12 million relating to other temporary differences.
The Group has capital losses carried forward, the taxation effect of which is 5 million 2013 4 million and temporary differences relating to capital losses of 61 million 2013 73 million.
The Group has rolled over capital gains of 43 million 2013 53 million : no taxation liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which the gains have been rolled be sold at their residual value, as it is anticipated that acapital loss would arise.
In the 2012 Autumn Statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the main rate of corporation taxation would be 21 per cent forthe year commencing 1 April 2014 and in the March 2013 Budget, he announced that the rate would be further reduced to 20 per cent with effect from 1 April 2015.
Both of these rate changes were included in the Finance Act 2013, which was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
In accordance with accounting standards, the effect of these rate reductions on deferred tax balances has been reflected in these accounts.
A net UKdeferred taxation liability is recognised and measured at the future rates, dependent on when temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Non-GAAP analysis of taxation charge credit unaudited Below, we present current and deferred taxation between the reported, specific and excluding specific items columns on a 52 week basis only.
Thebreak out of taxation between current and deferred taxation between the specific and excluding specific items columns requires estimation and assumptions and is non-GAAP information.
Management believes that this provides additional information on movements relating to one-off items and the movements relating to the trading results which the excluding specific items column represents.

Following the Postal Services Act 2011 and the transfer of the historic pension deficit, expectations of future profitability increased and it became appropriate to recognise a net deferred taxation asset in the UK.
In 2013-14, the current and deferred taxation amounts shown in the excluding specific items column are based on an assumption of what the taxation charge and allocation would have been, excluding the taxation impact of specific items.
For example, excluding the taxation consequences of the specific items in 2013-14, we would have utilised brought forward losses against taxable profits arising, to the extent available.

Employee benefits pensions At 30March 2014, a pension asset of 1,723 million has been recognised compared with 825 million at 31March 2013.
This increase mainly reflects the impact of the Pensions Reform as explained further in this note.

It represents the cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll of the increase over the year in the defined benefit obligation due to members earning one more year of pension benefits.
It is calculated in accordance with IAS 19 and is based on market yields high quality corporate bonds and inflation at the beginning of the Companys reporting year.
2 This is the employer contribution rate which forms part of the payroll expense and is paid into the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP RM section.
The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding valuation, usually every three years.
These actuarial valuations are required to be carried out on assumptions determined by the Trustee and agreed by Royal Mail.

Employee benefits pensions continued UK Defined Contribution Scheme The Group operates the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan, which was launched in April 2009 and is open to employees who joined the Company from 31March 2008 following closure of the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP to new members.
UK Defined Benefit schemes Royal Mail Group Limited had one of the largest defined benefit pension schemes in the UK based on membership and assets, called the RMPP.
On 1April 2012 one week into the 2012-13 reporting year after the granting of State Aid approval by the European Commission to HM Government on 21March 2012 almost all of the historic pension liabilities and pension assets of RMPP, built up until 31March 2012, were transferred to a new HM Government pension scheme, the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme RMSPS.
On this date, RMPP was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Limited and POL each responsible for their own sections from 1April 2012 onwards.
The transfer left the Royal Mail section of the RMPP RM section fully funded on an actuarial basis.
This means that, using long-term actuarial assumptions agreed at that date, it was predicted the Company would have to make no further cash deficit correction payments.
Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP The RMPP RM section is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds.
RMPP RM section includes sections A, B and C, each with different terms and conditions: Section A is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined before 1December 1971: Section B is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1December 1971 and before 1April 1987 or for members of Section A who chose to receive Section B benefits: and Section C is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1April 1987 and before 1April 2008.
Benefits provided are based on career salary blocks for years service, revalued annually.
Following conclusion of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the regular future service contribution rate for RMPP RM section, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, remained at 17.1 per cent 2013 17.1 per cent.
Following the State Aid clearance granted on 21March 2012, and the subsequent transfer of almost all of the RMPP assets and liabilities to HM Government on 1April 2012, no RMPP RM section cash deficit correction payment was made during the year.
The Group expects to contribute around 400 million to the RMPP RM section in respect of normal cash service costs in 2014-15.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP The Group also contributes to a smaller defined benefit scheme for executives, Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP which closed in December 2012 to future accrual.
The 2012-13 contributions were made at 35.9 per cent until 31December 2012.
The Company and the Trustee have reached agreement over the March 2012 actuarial valuation.
As the plan is closed to future accrual, there will be no regular future service contributions.
The Company is required to continue to make deficit correction payments of 10 million per annum until at least the date on which the 2018 valuation is completed no later than 30September 2018 as part of a funding agreement with the Trustee.
Deficit correction payments in 2013-14 were 10 million 2013 28 million including a special one-off payment of 19 million.
On 25March 2013, the Group placed 20 million into a money market fund investment established to provide security to RMSEPP, as part of a funding agreement with the RMSEPP Trustee.
This is treated as an investment in the Groups balance sheet.
A liability of 1 million 2013 1 million has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director.
Pensions Reform In June 2013, the Company began a consultation with RMPP RM section members on a proposal to ensure the RMPP RM section could remain open to future accrual, subject to certain conditions, at least until the conclusion of the next periodic review in March 2018.
Subsequently, on 26September 2013, the Company agreed with the RMPP Trustee to implement a Pensions Reform with effect from 1April 2014.
Under the Pensions Reform, basic pay elements of members pensionable pay after subtraction of the Lower Earnings Deduction for Section C members will increase by RPI up to five per cent each year regardless of whether employees actual basic pay increases by more or less, subject to potential additional increases to take account of certain increments or progressions within pay groups.
The agreed changes due to the Pensions Reform are considered to be a plan amendment which meets the IAS 19 definition of a past service cost, and as such 1,350 million has been recognised in the income statement of the Group for the year ended 30March 2014.

Employee benefits pensions continued Accounting and actuarial surplus deficit position RMPP RM section and RMSEPP Accounting IAS 19 Actuarial cash funding At 30March At 31March At 31March At 31March 2014 2013 2014 2013 Reported Reported Reported Reported m m m m Fair value of schemes assets see b below 3,833 3,343 3,873 3,343 Present value of schemes liabilities 2,097 2,513 2,451 3,505 Surplus deficit in schemes pre IFRIC 14 1,736 830 1,422 162 IFRIC 14 adjustment 13 5 n a n a Surplus deficit 1,723 825 1,422 162 There is no element of the present value of the schemes liabilities above that arises from schemes that are wholly unfunded.
The surplus in RMSEPP is assumed to be available as a refund as per IFRIC 14 and, as such, is shown net of withholding taxation.
The surplus in RMPP RM section is assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
Therefore, no IFRIC 14 adjustment is required.
The Directors do not believe that the current excess of pension scheme assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will result in an excess of pension assets on a funding basis.
However, the Directors are required to account for the pension scheme based on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRSs.
The actuarial cash funding surplus of 1,422 million 2013 deficit of 162 million allows the RMPP RM section to remain open for the benefit of the members at least until March 2018, subject to certain conditions as part of the Pensions Reform agreement, without requiring either the Company or individuals to make unaffordable increases to their cash contributions.
The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, gains losses and surplus deficit in the RMPP RM section and RMSEPP defined benefit schemes.
IAS 19 Accounting a Major long-term assumptions RMPP RM section and RMSEPP The major assumptions used to calculate the accounting position of the pension schemes were as follows: At 30March At 31March 2014 2013 Reported Reported % p. a.
Retail Price Index RPI 3.4 3.3 Consumer Price Index CPI 2.4 2.3 Discount rate nominal 4.5 4.8 3 real nominal less RPI 1.1 1.5 4 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries RPI-0.1% RPI 1% 5 CPI RPI Rate of increase for deferred pensions RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP Rate of increase for deferred pensions all other members CPI CPI Rate of pension increases RMPP RM section Sections A B CPI CPI 4 Rate of pension increases RMPP RM section Section C RPI-0.1% RPI-0.1% 5 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP CPI RPI 4 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP all other members RPI-0.1% RPI-0.1% Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old male RMPP RM section member 29 27 years 29 26 years Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old female RMPP RM section member 32 30 years 32 29 years 3 The real discount rate used reflects the long duration of the RMPP RM section scheme of around 28 years.
4 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members who joined RMPP on or after April 1987 and RMSEPP all other members, is capped at five per cent which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption.
5 This rate of increase is set by reference to CPI, following a High Court ruling on 11June 2013.
Mortality The mortality assumptions for RMPP RM section are based on the latest Self Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S1 mortality tables with appropriate scaling factors 106 per cent for male pensioners and 101 per cent for female pensioners.
Future improvements are based on the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum.

Employee benefits pensions continued Sensitivity analysis for RMPP RM section liabilities The RMPP RM section liabilities are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
The potential impact of the largest sensitivities on the RMPP RMsection liabilities is shown in the table below.
Potential increase in liabilities Key assumption change m Additional one year of life expectancy 50 Increase in inflation rate both RPI and CPI simultaneously of 0.1% p. a.
50 Decrease in discount rate of 0.1% p. a.
50 Increase in CPI assumption assuming RPI kept constant of 0.1% p. a.
15 This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that assesses the impact on the defined benefit obligation, resulting from reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year.
Changes opposite to those in the table e. g. an increase in discount rate would have the opposite effect on liabilities.
The average duration of the RMPP RM section obligation is 28 years 2013 28 years.

There were no open equity derivatives within this portfolio at 30March 2014 at 31March 2013 nil.
Included within the pension assets are 2.0 billion 2013 1.4 billion of HM Government Bonds.
The schemes assets do not include property occupied by the Group, the Groups own shares, or assets used by the Group.
Risk exposure and investment strategy The investment strategy of the RMPP Trustee aims to safeguard the assets of the scheme and to provide, together with contributions, the financial resource from which benefits are paid.
Investment is inevitably exposed to risks.
The investment risks inherent in the investment markets are partially mitigated by pursuing a widely diversified approach across asset classes and investment managers.
The RMPP RM section uses derivatives such as swaps and futures to reduce risks whilst maintaining expected investment returns.
The RMPP Trustee recognises that there is a natural conflict between improving the potential for positive return and limiting the potential for poor return.
The RMPP Trustee has specified objectives for the investment policy that balance these requirements.
The RMPP Trustee has elected to use interest rate and inflation rate swaps derivatives to deliver the investment strategy whilst managing risk.
These derivatives are recorded at market value within the table above and are commonly used by pension funds.
The interest rate and inflation rate swaps are used to hedge the exposure to movements in interest rates and inflation which are key long-term assumptions used to estimate future pension liabilities.
The economic exposure of these swaps full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 30March 2014 is 3.8 billion March 2013 1.5 billion.
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP RM section benefits when they become due.

Notional earnings per share This note explains the calculation of the Groups earnings per share.
The calculation for both reporting years is based on the 1,000,000,000 shares that were issued in September 2013 and which were subsequently listed on the London Stock Exchange in October 2013.
It is therefore deemed to be notional earnings per share as the shares were not in existence for the whole of the reporting years.

Organisation structure and share capital changes This note explains the incorporation of Royal Mail plc and the subsequent changes in share capital following the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange on 15October 2013.
A new company, Royal Mail Limited, was incorporated on 6September 2013 with share capital of 100 Ordinary Shares of 1.50 each total 150 issued to Royal Mail Holdings plc.
Royal Mail Holdings plc was renamed Postal Services Holding Company plc on 11September 2013 and was subsequently renamed Postal Services Holding Company Limited PSH on 12December 2013.
On 12September 2013, the special share in Royal Mail Group Limited, held by HM Government, was redeemed at par value of 1.
Subsequently, also on 12September 2013, share capital of 999,999,900 Ordinary Shares of 1.50 each total 1,499,999,850 was issued by Royal Mail Limited to PSH in consideration for the transfer from PSH of the entire issued share capital of Royal Mail Group Limited 50,0011.00shares.
Following this transfer, and therefore as at 12September 2013, the issued share capital of Royal Mail Limited comprised 1,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares of 1.50 each total 1,500,000,000.
On 17September 2013, Royal Mail Limited approved a reduction of capital by way of solvency statement to cancel 1.49 from each issued Ordinary Share of 1.50.
This reduction of capital was registered on 18September 2013, and reduced share capital from 1,500 million to 10 million and increased distributable reserves by 1,490 million.
Following this reduction, and therefore as at 18September 2013, the issued share capital of Royal Mail Limited comprised 1,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares of 0.01 each total 10,000,000.
On 19September 2013, Royal Mail Limited was re-registered as Royal Mail plc.
Royal Mail plc subsequently listed on the premium segment of the official list and the main market of the London Stock Exchange on 15October 2013.
Share-based payment This note provides details about the Free Shares allocated to employees, including the associated accounting charge to the Groups income statement under IFRS 2, and the number of shares held in the Share Incentive Plan SIP at the end of the reporting year.
Details of shares awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are also included.
Employee Free Shares Ordinary Shares representing ten per cent of the value of the Company were granted free of charge to eligible employees on 15October 2013, the date of the Initial Public Offering.
These Free Shares are held on behalf of employees in an HM Revenue and Customs HMRCapproved SIP administered by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited Equiniti, and it was expected that each eligible full-time employee would receive a total of 725 free shares at the date of the Initial Public Offering.
However, under HMRC rules at the time of flotation, employees can only be given a maximum of 3,000 worth of free shares in any taxation year.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11.
Share-based payment continued Employee Free Shares continued The initial market value of the award was measured at the closing mid-price of the Companys shares on 15October 2013 489 pence per share.
This valued an eligible full-time employees award at 3,545.25, in excess of the 3,000 maximum.
Accordingly, 613 shares were awarded to each eligible full-time employee as their 2013 SIP allocation.
The Company allocated a further 116 shares 729 in total see below to eligible full-time employees on 9April 2014 as a 2014 SIP allocation, subject to them remaining employees of Royal Mail Group Limited.
The 729 total shares awarded to eligible full-time employees comprises the 725 initial, expected allocation of shares and an additional four shares resulting from the reallocation of shares forfeited by certain employees who left the Group.
Part-time eligible employees have been allocated a pro-rata number of shares.
All allocated shares will be equity-settled.
The fair value of the award of Free Shares is 490 million, which will be charged to the income statement on a straight line basis, adjusted for good leavers, over the period of vesting three years for the 2013 SIP and four years for the 2014 SIP, in each case from the award date.
Acharge to the Group income statement of 94 million including 3 million National Insurance has been made for the year ended 30March 2014 for both SIP allocations as they were granted as one award.
The Free Shares are held in a Trust funded by Royal Mail and may only be distributed to, or for the benefit of, eligible employees.
The Trust is under the control of the Company and is operating for its benefit.
At March 2014 the Trust has been included in these consolidated financial statements.
A reconciliation of the Ordinary Shares held in the SIP at 30March 2014 is shown below.
Number of shares Initial shares award on 15October 2013 84,415,327 Shares transferred out of SIP good leavers 809,247 Remaining shares to be allocated 15,744,673 Total shares remaining in SIP at 30March 2014 99,350,753 Award of shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP As a result of the flotation in October 2013, and as permitted under the rules of the LTIP, the award granted to the Executive Directors and Senior Leadership Population in 2013 was converted from a cash award into an award of a total of around 2.2 million shares, based on a volume weighted average price of 529.14 pence.
These shares are not part of the SIP explained above and will be acquired separately by the Company from the market.
The performance conditions applying to this award will be measured in 2015-16.
The award will be accounted for as cash-settled, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.

Subsequent notes in this section provide more detailed disclosures on specific financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are shown in the table below.

The main purposes of these financial instruments are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments, such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations and are not disclosed further in this section.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, which create derivative assets and liabilities: principally commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the commodity, interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and finances.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial assets and liabilities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, each of which is summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates arises from the Groups loans, leases and interest bearing financial assets.
The drawn HM Government loans were at a fixed rate from the dates they were originally drawn until they were repaid at the Companys listing date.
The drawings under the Syndicated bank loan facilities are 600million 2013 nil but interest rates on 150 million of Term LoanA have been fixed over the life of the loan facility by entering into interest rate swaps.
The combined average maturity date is 2017 2013 the drawn HM Government loans had an average maturity date of 2019.
The finance lease obligations of 342 million are all at a fixed rate 2013 305million, all at fixed rate.
The total interest bearing financial assets of the Group excluding the non-current investments of 395million 2013 336million, which consist of the fixed and floating rate cash and cash equivalent investments, plus the current financial asset investments, are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with average maturity three days 2013 average maturity nine days.
Theseshort-dated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.
The Groups policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate financial instruments, combined with external hedging of interest rate risk, as appropriate, to keep a high percentage of its net debt fixed.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, and various purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency all of these exposures are in UKPIL.
GLS reporting currency is the Euro and most of its revenues and profits are Euro based.
There is some exposure to non-Euro currencies, principally in emerging European markets.
These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury.
Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts.
Hedging will not normally be considered for exposures of less than 1 million and hedging is normally confined to 80 per cent of the forecast exposure where forecast cash flows are highly probable.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14.
Financial assets and liabilities summary and management of financial risk continued Foreign currency risk translational risk The Groups functional currency is the pound Sterling.
GLS functional currency is the Euro.
GLS Euro profits are converted at the average exchange rate for the year, which can result in reported growth or decline which does not relate to underlying performance.
GLS balance sheet is converted at year end rates, and movements related to foreign currency translation are taken to equity.
UKPILs obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights SDRs a basket of currencies comprised of US Dollar, Japanese Yen, Sterling and Euro.
Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which is subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis.
UKPILs obligations to settle conveyance charges in US Dollar have been hedged to April 2015.
UKPIL has two hedge programmes one of which was completed during the reporting year covering obligations to settle Euro invoices on automation projects.
The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries mainly GLS.
However, it does hedge the transactional exposure created by inter-company loans with these subsidiaries and uses the translational exposure arising from GLS Euro profits to offset with other transactional exposures.
Commodity price risk UKPIL is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 130 million litres of fuel per year, and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services.
The Groups fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets.
The strategy uses over-the-counter derivative products in both US Dollar commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rate to manage these exposures.
In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas.
The Groups risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets.
These exposures are managed by locking into fixed rate price contracts with suppliers and using over-the-counter derivative products.
As the GLS business model works using subcontractors, responsible for purchasing their own fuel, GLS has no direct exposure to diesel costs.
The only other significant commodity exposure within GLS is power, which is fragmented across its European bases.
In view of the other highly hedged positions in Royal Mail, the Group takes the view that the unhedged exposure arising from the commodities in GLS does not add significant risk to the Group.
Credit risk UKPIL considers that a fair and equitable credit policy is in operation for all its account customers.
The level of credit granted is based on a customers risk profile assessed by an independent credit referencing agent.
The credit policy is applied rigidly within the regulated products area so as to ensure that UKPIL is not in breach of compliance legislation.
Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products is based on commercial factors, which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk.
UKPIL has a dedicated credit management team, which sets and monitors credit limits, and takes corrective action as and when appropriate.
The level of bad debt incurred for the whole Group is 0.1 per cent 2013 0.1 per cent of turnover.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalent investments, loans and receivables financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Group invests trades only with high-quality financial institutions.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
GLS operates a decentralised credit management model whereby each country is responsible for managing the credit risk associated with their customers.
Where appropriate, external credit checks are performed for new and existing customers, taking into account the customer profile, expected volume of business and consequent risk to the Company.
Liquidity risk The Groups primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows.
Typical short-term investments include money market funds and term deposits with approved counterparties.
Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure continuity of funding.
The unused facilities for the Group of 800 million expire in 2018 2013 900 million expiring in 2014.
Capital management The Group aims to maintain debt and equity levels consistent with an investment grade credit profile.
The Group intends to pursue a progressive dividend policy having regard to the normalised earnings progression of the Group.
Sensitivity As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the Group has no material exposure to operating profit risk from interest rate risk, exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 2013 nil.
The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS net assets into Sterling on consolidation.
The impact of a five per cent strengthening of Sterling would have been to reduce the Group net assets by 34 million 2013 31 million.

Financial assets and liabilities additional analysis This note provides an analysis of the pound Sterling carrying values of the financial assets and liabilities held in various foreign currencies, along with details of interest rates, interest rate risk and maturity timescales.
Table 1 shows all the financial assets and liabilities in detail and on a net basis.
Table 2 shows the net amount by currency.
Table 3 shows the respective assets liabilities by whether they are fixed, floating or non-interest bearing.
Table 4 shows the effective interest rate and maturity analysed as fixed rate, floating rate and non-interest bearing.
Carrying amounts and fair values Trade receivables, payables, prepayments, accruals and client payables have been omitted from this analysis on the basis that carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Pension scheme assets and liabilities are also excluded.
Fair values have been calculated using current market prices forward exchange rates commodity prices and discounted using appropriate discount rates.
There are no material differences between the fair value transaction price of all financial instruments at initial recognition and the fair value calculated using these valuation techniques.
The fair value of the HM Government loans non-current is nil at 30March 2014 2013 HM Government loans 1,165 million.
The fair value of total Obligations under finance leases is 341 million 2013 308 million.

Hedging programmes Information regarding the various hedging programmes in place to mitigate volatility in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates is provided below.
The hedging programmes use a number of financial derivative products to manage volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange.
If these hedges are in the money, i. e. hedged rates are better than the current market rate, then a derivative asset is recognised, and if they are out of the money a derivative liability is recognised.
Full disclosures are provided in this note even though the balance sheet amounts are not material in the context of the Groups total assets and liabilities.
The purpose of the Groups hedging programmes is to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates thereby providing certainty for planning.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Accounting rules require the Company to choose whether to designate cash flow hedge programmes or not subject to various tests.
The impact of not designating a cash flow hedge programme is that all gains or losses on the derivatives in the programme have to be taken immediately to the income statement and cannot be deferred into equity.
The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous reporting years: Hedging activities i The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases.
ii The jet fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast jet fuel usage.
iii The air conveyance hedge programme uses US Dollar forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.
iv Two capital programmes one of which completed during 2013-14 use Euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from Sterling Euro exchange rates for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.
v The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices.
vi The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices.
vii The interest rate hedge programme uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the exposure arising from interest rates on borrowings under the Syndicated bank loan facilities viii The UKPIL overseas postal operations hedge programme uses US Dollar and Japanese Yen forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from the US Dollar Sterling and Japanese Yen Sterling exchange rates elements of the forecast future net purchases of delivery services in SDRs from overseas postal operators.
This hedge programme covers the exposure up until the purchases are incurred and recognised on the balance sheet.
The Group had undesignated cash flow hedge programmes for the transactional exposure created by inter-company loans with GLS and the exposure of UKPIL to overseas postal operator liabilities for the period after the purchases have been incurred and recognised on the balance sheet until the time when they are settled.
The derivative balances of these programmes are not material.
Commodity price hedging The Groups normal operating activities result in the consumption of fuel both diesel and jet, electricity and gas.
The prices of these commodities can be volatile so the Group enters into price swap contracts to lock future purchases at an agreed volume into a known price.
For diesel fuel and jet fuel these price swaps are sometimes entered into on the US Dollar price for the commodity based upon available market prices, in which case the Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to lock into a combined Sterling price for the commodity.
The following table shows the commodity, risk and the percentage of the expected consumption hedged.
The Group hedges the cost of the underlying commodity and any irrecoverable VAT that is incurred on this cost.
It does not hedge any fuel duty.
The exposures shown in the following table exclude the costs of fuel duty and are based upon the hedges in place combined with market prices at the balance sheet date for the unhedged amounts.
Fuel duty and the associated VAT adds an additional cost of c. 100 million to diesel costs each reporting year.
Total fuel costs for 2014-15 are estimated to be 185 million.

The remaining net exposure is hedged with external forward foreign currency contracts.
For existing currency liabilities, the underlying exposures e. g. the foreign postal administration liabilities and the derivatives are both revalued to current market prices at the balance sheet date, meaning that no net gains or losses arise in the income statement.
For forecast future currency exposures, the derivatives are revalued at the balance sheet date and effective movements in value are deferred into equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
The following table shows for each hedge programme, the risk and the percentage hedged of the next 12 months exposure: Percentage of next 12 months exposure that has been hedged At 30March At 31March 2014 2013 Hedge programme Risk Reported Reported Air conveyance US$ exchange rate movements 94% 92% Capital programmes exchange rate movements 100% 95% Overseas postal operator SDR exchange rate movements 59% 17% GLS inter-company loan exchange rate movements 100% 100% The next 12 months exposure is calculated as the combination of the cost of settling liabilities during the next 12 months and the cost of revaluing unsettled liabilities at the end of 12 months.
As highlighted in note 14, the Company does not hedge the translational exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries, mainly GLS.
Derivative values At any point in time, the derivatives in these cash flow hedge programmes are either in the money which means the hedged rates are better than current market rates or out of the money which means the hedged rates are worse than current market rates.
The gains in the money and losses out of the money as at the balance sheet date are deferred into equity where the hedge is effective and an associated financial asset or financial liability is created in the balance sheet.
The financial asset liability is released when the derivative matures.
The amounts deferred into equity are released when the hedged transaction occurs.
The following tables show the derivative contracts entered into at 30March 2014 and 31March 2013 and the associated derivative assets and liabilities.

There are timing differences between the maturity of the derivatives and the maturity of the underlying hedged transaction.
For example, diesel derivatives that hedge the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2013 mature in April 2013.
Hence at 31March 2013, the balance sheet includes the market value of these derivatives but the cumulative gains and losses on these derivatives have been released from the hedge reserve to the income statement to match the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2013.
Therefore there are differences between derivative balances shown above and the balance on the hedging reserve.

Specific items The specific items provisions of 87 million at 30March 2014 2013 87 million include 62 million 2013 67 million for potential industrial diseases claims relating to both current and former employees of the Group.
Royal Mail Groups liability in respect of former employees arose in 2010 as a result of a Court of Appeal judgement that held the Group liable for diseases claims brought by individuals who were employed in the General Post Office telecommunications division and whose employment ceased prior to October 1981.

The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted.
3 million of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2014-15.
The remaining 25 million 2013 20 million mainly relates to IT systems costs associated with Post Office Limited separation, of which 12 million is expected to be utilised in 2014-15, with the remainder expected to be utilised in the following year.
An additional 7 million is in respect of a German property tax liability of 4 million, expected to be utilised in 2014-15, and employers National Insurance associated with the award of Employee Free Shares of 3 million, expected to be utilised within three to five years.
Other provisions charged as operating costs Other provisions of 45 million 2013 54 million mainly comprise onerous lease obligations, decommissioning costs and estimated exposures resulting from legal claims incurred in the normal course of business.
The majority of Other provision amounts are expected to be utilised in 2014-15, with 3 million onerous lease obligations and decommissioning costs expected to be utilised within two to three years, 2 million within three to five years and a further 12 million over a period greater than five years.

In line with the Groups accounting policy seeaccounting policies, this goodwill has been reviewed for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
The carrying value of GLS, excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities, is 492 million 2013 487 million at 30 March 2014 and the operating profit before transformation costs items is 108 million 2013 101 million for the period note 2.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Goodwill continued The disposal of business relates to the sale of G3 Worldwide Mail N. V. Spring, an associate company, on 2 April 2013.
The carrying value of GLS 492 million represents a multiple of 4.6 2013 4.8 of operating profit before transformation costs.
The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review i. e. the fair value less costs of disposal, has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 6.6.
On this basis, the net realisable value has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value.
The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 47 per cent to 3.5 to reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.
Intangible assets Intangible assets, mainly software, are recorded in much the same way as our physical assets such as property and vehicles, but with shorter useful lives over which they are amortised three to six years.
