ii US insurance operations The short-term fluctuations in investment returns for US insurance operations comprise amounts, net of related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs, in respect of the following items: 2014 m 2013 m note a Net equity hedge result 1,574 255 note b Other than equity-related derivatives 391 531 note c Debt securities 47 42 Equity-type investments: actual less longer-term return 16 89 Other items 17 30 Total 1,103 625 The short-term fluctuations in investment returns shown in the table above are stated net of a credit for the related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs of 653 million 2013: credit of 228 million.
Notes a Net equity hedge result This result comprises the net effect of: The accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities: Fair value movements on free-standing equity derivatives: Fee assessments and claim payments in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related changes to DAC amortisation.
Movements in the accounting values of the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities comprise those for: The Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit GMDB and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB for life guarantees which are valued under the US GAAP insurance measurement basis applied for IFRS in a way that substantially does not recognise the effect of equity market and interest rate changes.
These represent the majority of the guarantees offered by Jackson: and GMWB not for life embedded derivative liabilities which are required to be fair valued.
Fair value movements on these liabilities include the effects of changes to levels of equity markets, implied volatility and interest rates.
The free-standing equity derivatives are held to manage equity exposures of the variable annuity and fixed index annuity guarantees.
The net equity hedge result therefore includes significant accounting mismatches and other factors that detract from the presentation of an economic result caused by: The variable annuity and fixed annuity business guarantees being only partially fair valued under grandfathered GAAP: The interest rate exposure being managed through the other than equity-related derivative programme explained in note b below: and Jacksons management of its economic exposures for a number of other factors that are treated differently in the accounting frameworks, such as future fees and assumed volatility levels.
b Other than equity-related derivatives The fluctuations for this item comprise the net effect of: Fair value movements on free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives: Accounting effects of the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit GMIB and its reinsurance: and Related changes to DAC amortisation.
The free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives, are held to manage interest rate exposures and durations within the general account and the variable annuity and fixed index annuity guarantees described in note a above.
The GMIB liability is valued using the US GAAP measurement basis applied for IFRS reporting in a way that substantially does not recognise the effects of market movements.
Reinsurance arrangements are in place so as to essentially fully insulate Jackson from the GMIB exposure.
Notwithstanding that the liability is essentially fully reinsured, as the reinsurance asset is net settled it is deemed a derivative under IAS 39 which requires fair valuation.
The fluctuations for this item therefore include significant accounting mismatches caused by: The fair value movements booked in the income statement on the derivative programme being in respect of the management of interest rate exposures of the variable and fixed index annuity business, as well as the fixed annuity business guarantees and durations within the general account: Fair value movements on Jacksons debt securities of the general account being booked in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement: and The mixed measurement model that applies for the GMIB and its reinsurance.

Realised gains and losses are recorded in the income statement with normalised returns included in operating profit with variations from year to year included in the short-term fluctuations category.
The risk margin reserve charge for longer-term credit-related losses included in operating profit based on longer-term investment returns of Jackson for 2014 is based on an average annual risk margin reserve of 24 basis points 2013: 25 basis points on average book values of US$54.5 billion 2013: US$54.4 billion as shown below: 2014 2013 Average Average book Annual book Annual value RMR expectedloss value RMR expectedloss Moodysratingcategory orequivalentunder  US$m % US$m m US$m % US$m m A3 or higher 27,912 0.12 34 21 27,557 0.11 32 20 Baa1, 2 or 3 24,714 0.25 62 38 24,430 0.25 62 40 Ba1, 2 or 3 1,390 1.23 17 10 1,521 1.18 18 11 B1, 2 or 3 385 3.04 12 7 530 2.80 15 9 Below B3 92 3.70 4 2 317 2.32 7 5 Total 54,493 0.24 129 78 54,355 0.25 134 85 Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs see below 25 15 25 16 Risk margin reserve charge to operating profit for longer-term credit related losses 104 63 109 69 Consistent with the basis of measurement of insurance assets and liabilities for Jacksons IFRS results, the charges and credits to operating profits based on longer-term investment returns are partially offset by related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
In addition to the accounting for realised gains and losses described above for Jackson general account debt securities, included within the statement of other comprehensive income is a pre-tax credit for unrealised gains on debt securities classified as available-for-sale net of related change in amortisation of deferred acquisition costs of 869 million 2013: net unrealised losses of 1,591 million.
Temporary market value movements do not reflect defaults or impairments.
Additional details of the movement in the value of the Jackson portfolio are included in note C3.3 b. iii UK insurance operations The positive short-term fluctuations in investment returns for UK insurance operations of 464 million 2013: negative 254 million include net unrealised movements on fixed income assets supporting the capital of the shareholder-backed annuity business, reflecting the fall in bond yields since the end of 2013. iv Other Short-term fluctuations in investment returns of other operations, were negative 113 million 2013: negative 27 million representing unrealised value movements on investments and foreign exchange items.
v Default losses The Group did not experience any default losses on its shareholder-backed debt securities portfolio in 2014 or 2013.
146 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements B:  B1:  B1.3  Operatingsegments The Groups operating segments, determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, are as follows: Insurance operations Asset management operations Asia Eastspring Investments US Jackson US broker-dealer and asset management including Curian UK M&G including Prudential Capital The Groups operating segments are also its reportable segments for the purposes of internal management reporting with the exception of Prudential Capital PruCap which has been incorporated into the M&G operating segment for the purposes of segment reporting.
Performancemeasure The performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Company is IFRS operating profit attributable to shareholders based on longer-term investment returns, as described below.
This measurement basis distinguishes operating profit based on long-term investment returns from other constituents of the total profit as follows: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: Gain on sale of the Groups stake in PruHealth and PruProtect businesses in 2014 as explained in note D1: Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business.
This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012: Loss attaching to the held for sale Japan life business.
See note D1 for further details: and The costs associated with the domestication of the Hong Kong branch which became effective on 1 January 2014.
Segment results that are reported to the Group Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items are mainly in relation to the Group Head Office and the Asia Regional Head Office.
: a General principles i UK style with-profits business The operating profit based on longer-term returns reflects the statutory transfer gross of attributable tax.
Value movements in the underlying assets of the with-profits funds do not affect directly the determination of operating profit.
ii Unit-linked business The policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in both the unit liabilities and the backing assets.
iii US variable annuity and fixed index annuity business This business has guarantee liabilities which are measured on a combination of fair value and other, US GAAP derived, principles.
These liabilities are subject to an extensive derivative programme to manage equity and, with those of the general account, interest rate exposures.
The principles for determination of the operating profit and short-term fluctuations are necessarily bespoke, as discussed in section c below.
iv Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions Under IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between territories depending upon the nature of the grandfathered measurement basis.
In general, in those instances where the liabilities are particularly sensitive to routine changes in market conditions, the accounting basis is such that the impact of market movements on the assets and liabilities is broadly equivalent in the income statement, and operating profit based on longer-term investments returns is not distorted.
In these circumstances, there is no need for the movement in the liability to be bifurcated between the elements that relate to longer-term market conditions and short-term effects.
However, some types of business movements in liabilities do require bifurcation to ensure that at the net level ie after allocated investment return and change for policyholder benefits the operating result reflects longer-term market returns.
Examples of where such bifurcation is necessary are in Hong Kong and for UK shareholder-backed annuity business, as explained in sections b i and d i, respectively.
Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 147 v Other shareholder-financed business The measurement of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns reflects the particular features of long-term insurance business where assets and liabilities are held for the long-term and for which the accounting basis for insurance liabilities under current IFRS is not generally conducive to demonstrating trends in underlying performance of life businesses exclusive of the effects of short-term fluctuations in market conditions.
In determining the profit on this basis, the following key elements are applied to the results of the Groups shareholder-financed operations.
Except in the case of assets backing liabilities which are directly matched such as linked business or closely correlated with value movements as discussed below operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for shareholder-financed business is determined on the basis of expected longer-term investment returns.
Debt, equity-type securities and loans Longer-term investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the period interest dividend income and for both debt and equity-type securities longer-term capital returns.
In principle, for debt securities and loans, the longer-term capital returns comprise two elements: Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.
The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the operating result is reflected in short-term fluctuations in investment returns: and The amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses to operating results based on longer-term investment returns to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.
At 31 December 2014, the level of unamortised interest-related realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group was a net gain of 467 million 2013: 461 million.
Equity type securities For equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations.
Equity-type securities held for shareholder-financed operations other than the UK annuity business, unit-linked and US variable annuity are of significance for the US and Asia insurance operations.
Different rates apply to different categories of equity-type securities.
Derivative value movements Generally, derivative value movements are excluded from operating results based on longer-term investment returns unless those derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in operating profit.
The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit arises in Jackson, as discussed below in section c. b Asia insurance operations i Business where policyholder liabilities are sensitive to market conditions For certain Asia non-participating business, for example in Hong Kong, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term.
For these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the operating results should reflect the asset share feature, rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis also applied for IFRS basis was used.
For certain other types of non-participating business, longer-term interest rates are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining operating results.
ii Other Asia shareholder-financed business Debt securities For this business the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for these operations are being amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve charge.
148 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements B:  B1:  Equity-type securities For Asia insurance operations, excluding assets of the Japan life held for sale business, investments in equity securities held for nonlinked shareholder-financed operations amounted to 932 million as at 31 December 2014 2013: 571 million.
The rates of return applied in the years 2014 and 2013 ranged from 2.73 per cent to 13.75 per cent with the rates applied varying by territory.
These rates are determined after consideration by the Groups in-house economists of long-term expected real government bond returns, equity risk premium and long-term inflation.
These rates are broadly stable from period to period but may be different between countries reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each territory.
The assumptions are for returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions.
The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations.
The longer-term investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures accounted for using the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.
c US Insurance operations i Separate account business For such business, the policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the asset value movements.
Accordingly, the operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflect the current period value movements in unit liabilities and the backing assets.
ii US variable and fixed index annuity business The following value movements for Jacksons variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
See note B1.2 note ii : Fair value movements for equity-based derivatives: Fair value movements for embedded derivatives for Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit not for life and fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit reinsurance see below : Movements in accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for life and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liabilities, for which, under the grandfathered US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jacksons insurance assets and liabilities, the measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current period market movements: Fee assessments and claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities: and Related amortisation of deferred acquisition costs for each of the above items.
Embedded derivatives for variable annuity guarantee features The Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit liability, which is essentially fully reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claims limit, is accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 944-80 Financial Services Insurance Separate Accounts formerly SOP 03-1 under IFRS using grandfathered US GAAP.
As the corresponding reinsurance asset is net settled, it is considered to be a derivative under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement, and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value.
As the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit is economically reinsured the mark to market element of the reinsurance asset is included as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
iii Other derivative value movements The principal example of non-equity based derivatives for example interest rate swaps and swaptions whose value movements are excluded from operating profit arises in Jackson.
Non-equity based derivatives are primarily held by Jackson as part of a broadly-based hedging programme for features of Jacksons bond portfolio for which value movements are booked in the statement of comprehensive income rather than the income statement, product liabilities for which US GAAP accounting as grandfathered under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged, and the interest rate exposure attaching to equity-based embedded derivatives.
iv Other US shareholder-financed business Debt securities Jackson is the shareholder-backed operation for which the distinction between impairment losses and interest-related realised gains and losses is in practice relevant to a significant extent.
Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations NRSRO or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC developed by external third parties such as PIMCO or BlackRock Solutions to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business.
Debt securities held to back separate account and reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge.
Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses, for Jackson are shown in note B1.2.
Financial statements B: Earnings performance Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 149 Equity-type securities As at 31 December 2014, the equity-type securities for US insurance non-separate account operations amounted to 1,094 million 2013: 1,118 million.
For these operations, the longer-term rates of return for income and capital applied in 2014 and 2013, which reflect the combination of the average risk free rates over the period and appropriate risk premiums are as follows: 2014 2013 Equity-type securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds 6.2% to 6.7% 5.7% to 6.8% Other equity-type securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds 8.2% to 8.7% 7.7% to 9.0% d UK Insurance operations i Shareholder-backed annuity business For this business, policyholder liabilities are determined by reference to current interest rates.
The value movements of the assets covering liabilities are closely correlated with the related change in liabilities.
Accordingly, asset value movements are recorded within the operating results based on longer-term investment returns.
Policyholder liabilities include a margin for credit risk.
Variations between actual and best estimate expected impairments are recorded as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
The operating results based on longer-term investment returns reflects the impact of value movements on policyholder liabilities for annuity business in PRIL and the PAC non-profit sub-fund after adjustments to allocate the following elements of the movement to the category of short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The impact on credit risk provisioning of actual upgrades and downgrades during the period: Credit experience compared to assumptions: and Short-term value movements on assets backing the capital of the business.
Credit experience reflects the impact of defaults and other similar experience, such as asset exchanges arising from debt restructuring by issuers that include effectively an element of permanent impairment of the security held.
Positive or negative experience compared to assumptions is included within short-term fluctuations in investment returns without further adjustment.
The effects of other changes to credit risk provisioning are included in the operating result, as is the net effect of changes to the valuation rate of interest due to portfolio rebalancing to align more closely with management benchmark.
ii Non-linked shareholder-financed business For debt securities backing non-linked shareholder-financed business of the UK insurance operations other than the annuity business the realised gains and losses are principally interest related.
e Fund management and other non-insurance businesses For these businesses, the particular features applicable for life assurance noted above do not apply.
For these businesses it is inappropriate to include returns in the operating result on the basis described above.
Instead, it is appropriate to generally include realised gains and losses in the operating result with temporary unrealised gains and losses being included in short-term fluctuations.
In some instances, it may also be appropriate to amortise realised gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments to operating results over a time period that reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements.
