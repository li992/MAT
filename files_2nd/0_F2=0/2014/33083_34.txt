If a firm other than the audit firm were to undertake this work then they would have to spend a significant amount of additional time becoming familiar with those entities.

Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
The market value of investment and development property at 31 December 2014 includes 74.4 million 31 December 2013 29.3 million in respect of property considered to be developments.
These are accounted for as investment property and are valued using the same methodology as other investment property.
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset.

co. uk Accounts Notes to the accounts continued 19 Investment and development property continued Valuation process It is the Groups policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development property at both 30 June and 31 December.
The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data along with asset specific business plans.
The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations see valuation methodology below.
These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and reviewed with the Groups asset management team and Directors.
The Group engages a number of independent valuation experts to undertake the Groups property valuations.
A summary of the valuers and the value of property assets they have been engaged to value is given below: Re-presented 2014 2013 m m DTZ 4,623.5 4,100.5 Cushman & Wakefield 2,200.0 1,900.0 CBRE 1,248.1 1,188.6 Jones Lang LaSalle 143.1 Others 10.0 6.9 8,081.6 7,339.1 In addition to the above, investment properties in the Groups joint ventures were valued by Knight Frank, Jones Lang LaSalle and DTZ.
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the valuation output.
Valuation methodology The fair value of the Groups investment and development property as at 31 December 2014 was determined by independent external valuers at that date.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the majority of the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.
The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
Annual property income as disclosed in the table below reflects current annualised gross income.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the Glossary.
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants.
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield in isolation, would result in a significant change in the value of investment and development property.
A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value of 874 million 31 December 2013 718 million re-presented, while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total market value of 718 million 31 December 2013 611 million re-presented.

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties.
Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income, and obligations for expenses, in respect of their beneficial interest in the property.
The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property.
This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee.
Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.

The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in note 35.
The market value of assets secured as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2014 is 8,818.6 million.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property where a credit facility secured on that property is in place.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
The Company had non-current borrowings of 230.0 million at 31 December 2014 consisting of a revolving credit facility expiring in 2019 2013 285.0 million.
This debt is floating rate, secured and its fair value is equal to book value.

co. uk Accounts Notes to the accounts continued 33 Convertible bonds 2.5 per cent convertible bonds the 2.5 per cent bonds On 4 October 2012 Intu Jersey Limited the Issuer issued 300.0 million 2.5 per cent Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due 2018 at par all of which remain outstanding at 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2014 the exchange price was 3.5759 per ordinary share.
The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations including payments in respect of the 2.5 per cent bonds and the obligations of the Company, as Guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company.
Subject to certain conditions, the 2.5 per cent bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or at the Companys election any combination of ordinary shares and cash.
The 2.5 per cent bonds can be converted at any time from 14 November 2012 up to the 20th dealing day before the maturity date.
The initial exchange price was 4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 100,000 nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds.
Under the terms of the 2.5 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted upon certain events including the rights issue on 22 April 2014 and the payment of dividends by the Company.
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Companys option subject to the Companys ordinary share price having traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the 2.5 per cent bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the 2.5per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the changes in fair value of financial instruments line.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of the 2.5 per cent bonds was 325.6 million 2013 312.8 million, with the change in fair value reflected in note13.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During the year interest of 7.5 million 2013 7.5 million in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs.
In the Companys balance sheet the bondholder option is held at its fair value of 25.6 million on a derivative financial instrument.
3.75 per cent convertible bonds the 3.75 per cent bonds In 2011 the Company issued 154.3 million, 3.75 per cent perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, with a conversion price of 4.00per ordinary share, in connection with the acquisition of intu Trafford Centre.
These were accounted for as equity at their fair value on issue which totalled 143.7 million.
Following the rights issue on 22 April 2014, the conversion price was adjusted to 3.64 per ordinary share.
On 2 July 2014 a conversion notice was issued for all the bonds resulting in 42,394,779 new ordinary shares being issued.
During the year interest of 2.9 million 2013 5.8 million has been recognised on these bonds directly in equity.
This is deducted in arriving at earnings per share see note 17.
34 Operating leases The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.

co. uk Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information Accounts 35 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 40 to 46.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Re-presented Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2014 2014 2013 2013 m m m m 1 Borrowings 2,738.4 1,448.6 2,292.8 1,561.9 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 943.9 943.9 1,207.4 1,207.4 Net borrowings profile 3,682.3 504.7 3,500.2 354.5 Interest rate protection 87.9% 90.8% 1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and excludes the Metrocentre compound financial instruments and finance leases.
At 31 December 2014 they include the 230.0 million 2013 - 285.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility which incurs interest at a variable rate.
Excluding the revolving credit facility borrowing interest rate protection is 93.1 per cent 2013 98.1per cent.
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 2.24 per cent 2013 2.71 per cent.
Unallocated and forward starting swaps are excluded from the above calculation.
The nominal value of these swaps is 746.7 million of which 125.0 million are forward starting.
Their fair value of 242.5 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 83.6 million 2013 73.7 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 90.2 million 2013 78.7 million in the fair value of derivatives.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to ensure the Groups net exposure to foreign currency is less than 10 per cent of the Groups equity attributable to owners of the Company.
At 31 December 2014 the Groups exposure amounted to 6.4 per cent of equity attributable to owners of the Company 31 December 2013 7.6 per cent.

The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 26.5 million 2013 24.2 million to equity attributable to owners of the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 31.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years.
As at 31 December 2014, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of eight years 2013 eight years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by re borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December2014 is 3.4 million 2013 4.0 million.
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Re-presented Group 2014 2013 m m Up to three months 22.5 13.6 Three to six months 2.1 2.4 Trade receivables 24.6 16.0 At 31 December 2014 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling 7.1 million 2013 6.1 million.
The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and hybrid financial instruments.
The Group aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover.
The Groups stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 4050 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 1.60x.
At 31 December 2014 the debt to asset ratio remains within the preferred range and the interest cover ratio continues to be above the preferred level.
As the Groups debt is sometimes secured on joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share of joint ventures.
A reconciliation from the relevant amounts as presented to those including the Groups share of joint ventures is presented in the Other information section.
