Financial risk management Essentras activities expose the business to a number of key financial risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Essentras system of internal control and financial risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Essentra has a centralised treasury function to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury function is subject to periodic independent reviews by the Group Assurance department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Treasury Committee.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographical presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Essentras financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Essentra has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Essentra manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Essentras exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
Essentra monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
As at 31 December 2014, gross trade receivables were 151.8m 2013: 130.7m of which 25.1m 2013: 19.4m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2014 2013 m m Up to 3 months 25.1 19.4 As at 31 December 2014, trade receivables of 6.3m 2013: 5.7m were provided for as they were considered to be impaired.
The ageing of the impaired receivables provided for is as follows: 2014 2013 m m Up to 3 months 1.6 2.1 Over 3 months 4.7 3.6 6.3 5.7 105 ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | WWW.
Financial risk management continued The movement in the provision for impaired receivables is as follows: 2014 2013 m m Beginning of year 5.7 4.9 Impaired receivables acquired 0.5 1.5 Impairment loss recognised 2.8 0.6 Release in the year 1.6 0.4 Utilisation 1.1 0.9 End of year 6.3 5.7 Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Essentra monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Essentra by classifying derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | WWW.
COM a Currency risk Essentra publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Essentras net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
Essentras US dollar denominated assets were approximately 48% 2013: 45% hedged by the US dollar denominated borrowings.
At 31 December 2014, Essentra did not have any euro denominated borrowings as these were repaid with the proceeds from the share placing during the year.
At 31 December 2013, Essentras euro denominated assets were 82% hedged by its euro denominated borrowings.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Essentras transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is limited.
However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months.
Essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are transferred either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.

Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk During 2014, Essentras strategy was to ensure with a reasonable degree of certainty that at least 50% of the overall net finance expense is protected against material adverse movements in interest rates using fixed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps and caps.
With effect from 1 January 2015, Essentra implemented a revised policy, which is to ensure that at least 30% of the total debt with maturities of more than one year is protected with fixed interest rates or approved interest rate derivatives.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Essentras interest rate derivatives.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had no significant floating rate debt and therefore has no significant sensitivity to interest rate movements.
There is no impact on amounts recorded directly in other comprehensive income or equity.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Essentra, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
On 1 July 2014, Essentra plc refinanced its bank facilities, and replaced the existing 330m sterling and euro-denominated five-year revolving credit facilities with a new 390m five-year facility at more competitive terms.
Essentras objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Essentra is mostly funded by two series of US$80m US Private Placement Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated 5-year revolving credit facilities of 262m and 160m from its bankers.
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have maturities of seven and ten years and the revolving credit facilities mature in July 2019.
At 31 December 2014 the available bank facilities totalled 387.0m 2013: 322.0m of which nil 2013: 153.3m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
During the year, Essentra issued a total of 23,659,761 new ordinary shares of 25p each at a price of 713.5p per share, raising gross proceeds of 168.8m, to fund the acquisition of the Specialist Packaging Division of Clondalkin Group see note 23.
During 2013, Essentra issued a total of 21,142,613 new ordinary shares of 25p each at a price of 675p per share, raising gross proceeds of 142.7m, to fund the acquisition of Contego.
Amounts drawn by Essentra on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Essentras available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2014 2013 m m Expiring after two years 387.0 168.7 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.

Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
These are determined to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The only financial instrument with fair value determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, which is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is the deferred contingent consideration of 5.8m relating to the acquisition of Mesan Kilit A. S. 2013: 6.2m relating to the acquisitions of Ulinco Components and Mesan Kilit A.
The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration is estimated based on an assessment of the likely outcome of the acquired business financial performance.
There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
During the year, a fair value gain of 0.6m 2013: fair value gain of 0.8m in respect of financial instruments at level 3 fair value hierarchy was recognised within exceptional items see note 3, and nil 2013: 0.4m was settled in cash.
No other fair value gains or losses were recorded in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes.
The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 101.9m 2013: 95.5m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes at 31 December 2014 is 111.3m 2013: 105.7m.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate their fair values at the reporting date.

Essentra sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Essentra manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Essentra may return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Essentra monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2014, Essentras strategy, which was unchanged from 2013, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 31 December 2014 was low due to the inclusion of proceeds from the issue of 23,659,761 shares during 2014, to fund the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD which was completed on 30 January 2015.

Income tax expense in the UK is 4.6m 2013: 0.7m.
The UK corporate tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% on 1 April 2014 and a further reduction in the rate to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 has been enacted.
The impact of these enacted changes on deferred tax is not material.

The weighted average useful economic lives of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year were 15.0 years and 10.7 years 2013: 15.2 years and 14.4 years respectively.
Essentra tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units as appropriate.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units, being the operating segments, as follows: Goodwill 2014 2013 Operating segment m m Component & Protection Solutions 69.2 55.2 Porous Technologies 25.6 24.5 Packaging & Securing Solutions 110.6 109.7 Other Extrusion 6.4 6.8 211.8 196.2 Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below: Customer relationships and other intangible assets 2014 2013 Business Operating segment m m Components Businesses of former Moss and Skiffy Component & Protection Solutions 14.2 16.1 Components Businesses of former Richco Component & Protection Solutions 33.9 34.6 Components Business of former Reid Supply Component & Protection Solutions 8.3 8.9 Components Business of former Mesan Component & Protection Solutions 16.9 18.8 Components Abric Component & Protection Solutions 10.4 Porous St Charles Porous Technologies 4.8 5.3 Porous Chicopee Porous Technologies 13.8 14.1 Packaging Packaging & Securing Solutions 3.2 3.7 Speciality Tapes Packaging & Securing Solutions 13.4 14.0 Healthcare Packaging & Securing Solutions 69.1 78.4 Multiple businesses Multiple segments 6.6 6.6 194.6 200.5 The tests are based on the following assumptions: Cash flows for the next two years are based upon the Groups annual Plan.
The key assumptions in the cash flow projections for the Groups annual Plan are the revenue growth and operating margin for each division.
Operating margin was primarily based on the levels achieved in 2014, which are disclosed in note 2, adjusted by targets set for revenue expansion and cost control and reduction for each individual division within the Plan period Cash flows beyond the Plan period are based on year twos Plan cash flows with growth rates specific to each business which range from nil to 3% 2013: nil to 3% The estimated cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon Essentras estimated post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.3% 2013: 8.6% adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for each group of cash generating units to which significant goodwill is allocated are as follows: 16.7% 2013: 16.0% for Component & Protection Solutions, 13.1% 2013: 12.5% for Porous Technologies, 11.7% 2013: 11.2% for Packaging & Securing Solutions and 11.7% 2013: 11.2% for Other Any impairment losses identified as a result of the analysis are recognised in profit or loss.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash flows by up to 70%, reducing terminal growth rates by up to 4 percentage points or increasing pre-tax discount rates by up to 150 basis points.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite significantly lower post-tax operating cash flows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the value in use of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying value.

Derivatives continued Fair value derivatives protect the Group from currency risk exposure from changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a previously unrecognised firm commitment to buy or sell assets at a fixed price.
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
Of the balance at 31 December 2014, 2.9m relates to a cash flow hedge on the consideration for the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD, which completed on 30 January 2015 see note 23.
The other cash flow hedges relate to usual trading transactions in foreign currencies, and the related cash flows are expected to occur within nine months.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
Essentra had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.

Employee benefits Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The Group also has a number of other post-employment obligations in certain countries, some of which are required under local law.
The defined benefit plans are administered by boards of trustees and the assets are held independently from Essentra.
The boards of trustees comprise member nominated trustees, employer nominated trustees and independent advisory trustees.
The articles of the plans prohibit a majority on the boards to be established by either the member or employer nominated trustees.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2012 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
The principal European defined benefit schemes entitle remaining members to a pension calculated on 1.25% or 2% of their capped final pensionable pay multiplied by the number of pensionable years of service.
Some members have historical entitlements to accrual rates of 1.67%-1.9% and 3% for certain tranches of their service.
The principal US defined benefit schemes entitle certain participating employees to annuity benefits equal to 50% of final average pensionable salary, reduced for years of service less than 30, and other participating employees to annuity benefits equal to $49 per month for each year of service.
The amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Amounts expensed against operating profit Defined contribution schemes 4.9 3.2 Defined benefit schemes service cost 2.2 2.4 Defined benefit schemes settlement gain 1.4 Other post-employment obligations 0.5 Total operating expense 6.2 5.6 Amounts included as finance income expense Net interest on defined benefit scheme assets note 4 1.2 0.8 Net interest on defined benefit scheme liabilities note 4 0.6 0.9 Net finance income expense 0.6 0.1 Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income Return on defined benefit scheme assets excluding amounts in net finance income 16.7 10.8 Impact of changes in assumptions and experience to the present value of defined benefit scheme liabilities 32.5 0.4 Remeasurement of defined benefit schemes 15.8 11.2 During the year, an offer to settle the pension obligations was made by the US board of trustees to deferred members of the US pension schemes.
A settlement gain has been recognised in profit or loss relating to those members who accepted the offer.
Employee benefits continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: 2014 2013 Europe US Europe US 1 Increase in salaries pre-2010 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 1 Increase in salaries post-2010 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 1 Increase in pensions at RPI capped at 5% 3.00% n a 3.30% n a at CPI capped at 5% 2.10% n a 2.40% n a at CPI minimum 3%, capped at 5% 3.20% n a 3.30% n a at CPI capped at 2.5% 1.70% n a 1.90% n a Discount rate 3.70% 4.00% 4.50% 4.90% Inflation rate 2.60% n a 2.90% n a 1 For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement.
For service after April 2010, pension is linked to salary at April 2010 with annual increases capped at 3% Due to the timescale covered, the assumptions applied may not be borne out in practice.
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit obligations at the year end are: 2014 2013 Europe US Europe US Male retiring today at age 65 22.4 21.6 22.3 19.3 Female retiring today at age 65 24.7 23.8 24.7 21.1 Male retiring in 20 years at age 65 24.3 23.3 24.2 19.3 Female retiring in 20 years at age 65 26.6 25.5 26.5 21.1 The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustees investment policies.
The allocation of assets is arrived at taking into consideration current market conditions and trends, the size of potential returns relative to investment risk and the extent to which asset realisation needs to match liability maturity.
There are risks underlying these considerations.
If asset returns fall below the returns required for scheme assets to match the present value of scheme liabilities, a scheme deficit results.
Persistent deficits represent an obligation the Group has to settle through increased cash contributions.
If asset maturities are not properly matched with liability maturities, there is also the risk that the Group could be required to make unplanned short-term cash contributions to resolve resulting liquidity issues.
Scheme assets are invested by the trustees in asset classes and markets that are considered to be reasonably liquid, so this matching and liquidity risk is considered to be sufficiently mitigated.

Acquisitions 2014 acquisitions: Abric On 16 December 2014, Essentra acquired 100% of the share capital of the major operating subsidiaries of Abric Berhad Abric.
Abric is a global manufacturer and distributor of security sealing products and solutions for use in a diverse range of growing end-markets including healthcare, manufacturing, energy, retail, transportation and automotive, and is reported under the Component & Protection Solutions division.
The acquisition of Abric expanded the product range and customer base of the Component Distribution businesses and extended the divisions geographical presence primarily in Asia Pacific.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Essentra.
Due to the timing of the transaction, the fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The Groups revenue and operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2014 are currently being assessed, and therefore it is impracticable to disclose this information as at the date of these financial statements.
Related acquisition expenses of 1.5m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
A summary of the acquisition of Abric is detailed below: Fair value of assets liabilities acquired m Property, plant and equipment 4.2 Inventories 3.0 Receivables 3.3 Cash and cash equivalents 1.8 Deferred tax 2.5 Payables 2.8 Borrowings 3.8 3.2 Customer relationships 10.4 Goodwill 11.9 Consideration 25.5 Satisfied by: Initial cash consideration 25.3 Deferred consideration 0.2 Cash consideration 25.3 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 1.8 Net cash flow in respect of the acquisition 23.5 Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables and payables were all reassessed to their fair value.
The gross contractual amount receivable of the receivables was 3.7m.
Goodwill represents the expected operating synergies and financial synergies, and the value of an assembled workforce.
Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of recognising customer relationships and other intangible assets and the tax effect of the fair value adjustments above.

Acquisitions continued 2014 acquisitions: Kelvindale On 12 May 2014, Essentra acquired 100% of the share capital of Kelvindale Products Pty Limited Kelvindale for 2.6m net of cash acquired.
Kelvindale is a manufacturer and distributor of an extensive range of plastic protection and finishing products, and is reported under Component & Protection Solutions.
The acquisition provides a compelling entry point for the Group into the Australian market.
The amounts of assets and liabilities acquired were not material.
Relevant previous acquisitions During 2014, Essentra reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of Contego Healthcare Limited Contego which was acquired on 30 April 2013, and made changes to certain accruals, property, plant and equipment, and deferred tax assets.
The impact on goodwill is an increase of 1.7m.
In addition, Essentra reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of Dakota and Mesan, which were also acquired in 2013.
In respect of the acquisition of Dakota, some changes were made to certain accruals and adjustments to the fair value of receivables and inventories.
These adjustments were insignificant individually and in aggregate.
2015 acquisitions: Clondalkin On 30 January 2015, Essentra acquired the entire Specialist Packaging Division of Clondalkin Group Clondalkin SPD from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus.
Clondalkin is a global provider of speciality secondary packaging solutions for the pharmaceutical and health & personal care industries.
With 24 facilities in North America and Europe, the acquisition of Clondalkin SPD significantly enhances Essentras existing geographic presence in healthcare packaging and, through leveraging the combined footprint of both businesses, will allow the Group to further exploit both existing, and attractive new growth opportunities.
Clondalkin SPDs product portfolio of folding carton, product literature and labels is complementary to the Groups current packaging and authentication capabilities, therefore broadening the range and innovation offered to customers.
Due to the timing of the transaction, the purchase price allocations and fair value adjustments are in progress at the time of this report.
The consideration of 309.4m was funded in part by a placing of 23,659,761 new ordinary shares, and the balance is funded from existing bank facilities.
Related acquisition expenses of 5.3m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
Transactions with related parties During 2014, the Filters business in Jordan was disposed of to the minority shareholder who was also a director of the business, for a consideration of US$50,000.
A loss on disposal of 0.4m arose from the transaction.
Other than this transaction and the compensation of key management note 6, Essentra has not entered into any material transactions with related parties during 2014.
On 3 July 2013, Essentra acquired a further 14.545% of the share capital of Filthai Company Limited Filthai from the minority shareholders for a cash consideration of 1.9m.
Other than the acquisition of further shares in Filthai and the compensation of key management, Essentra did not enter into any material transactions with related parties during the prior year.

The principal subsidiary undertakings of Essentra plc are listed in note 10 to the Essentra plc company financial statements.
Adjusted measures Management reviews the adjusted operating profit and operating cash flow as measures of the performance of the business.
Adjusted operating profit is stated before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items which are considered not relevant to measuring the performance of the business.
Operating cash flow is adjusted operating profit before depreciation, share option expense and other non-cash items, less working capital movements and net capital expenditure as shown below: 2014 2013 m m Operating profit 108.8 97.0 Intangible amortisation 17.5 14.2 Exceptional operating items 16.2 19.2 Adjusted operating profit 142.5 130.4 Depreciation 27.2 26.7 Share option expense 6.8 5.1 Other non-cash items 11.0 6.0 Working capital movements 25.4 5.3 Net capital expenditure 33.1 43.7 Operating cash inflow 107.0 107.2 28.
