Amounts shown in respect of long-term insurance contracts represent estimated undiscounted cash flows for the Groups life assurance contracts.
In determining the projected payments, account has been taken of the contract features, in particular that the amount and timing of the contractual payments reflect either surrender, death or contract maturity.
In addition, the undiscounted amounts shown include the expected payments based on assumed future investment returns on assets backing insurance and investment contract liabilities.
The projected cash flows exclude the unallocated divisible surplus of with-profits funds see below.
All linked contracts and almost all non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts the earliest contractual maturity is therefore at the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.
Although we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, the total liability for linked and non-linked investment contracts is shown in the less than one year column above.
Amounts shown in respect of general insurance contracts are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, including for those classes of business for which discounted provisions are held, see Financial statements IFRS Note 41 Insurance liabilities.
The timing of cash flows reflects a best estimate of when claims will be settled.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.
Includes obligations for repayment of collateral received under stock lending arrangements and derivative transactions amounting to 5,577 million.
When subordinated debt is undated or loan notes perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years.
Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 72 million.
Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated using fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.
The unallocated divisible surplus represents the excess of assets over liabilities, including policyholder asset share liabilities in the UK, which reflect the amount payable under the realistic Peak 2 reporting regime of the Prudential Regulatory Authority.
Although accounted for as a liability, as permitted by IFRS 4, there is currently no expected payment date for the unallocated divisible surplus.
Provisions include pension obligations, which have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above, due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future cash flows.
The Group operates both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution pension schemes, full details of which are provided in IFRS Financial Statements Note 49 Pension obligations.
We have a contractual obligation to fund these schemes.
However, the amount and timing of the Groups cash contributions to these schemes is uncertain and will be affected by factors such as future investment returns and demographic changes.
Our cash funding of defined contribution schemes is based on percentages of salary.
Our cash contribution to defined benefit schemes is agreed in advance with scheme trustees.
The Company and trustees have agreed to a long-term funding plan where contributions, together with anticipated growth on scheme investments are expected to eliminate the funding deficits over time.
Contributions to these and the other schemes are regularly reviewed in light of changes in expectations of investment returns and other assumptions.
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 20 years in the main UK scheme, 19 years in the RAC scheme, 20 years in the Irish scheme and 12 years in the Canadian scheme.
