Further aspects of the groups financial performance in 2013 14 are outlined below.
Corporate Costs Corporate costs increased in the year from 24.8 million to 33.3 million which represents just over 1.1% of sales.
The principal reasons for this increase were higher performance related bonus and share-based payments and the need for additional resources to support the continuing growth in the business: corporate costs in 2012 13 were lower than in previous years as the group failed to meet its in-year performance targets.
Going forward, as we continue to grow, we expect that corporate costs will average just over 1% of sales.
Operating Profit The operating profit for the year increased by 17% to 448.2 million.
Underlying operating profit increased by 13% to 468.9 million which in 2013 14 excluded the amortisation of acquired intangibles of 20.7 million.
