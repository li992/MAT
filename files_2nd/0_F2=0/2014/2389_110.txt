Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, including an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next five years is agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
The minimum funding requirement therefore represents seven years of future contributions, which amounted to $4,720 million at 31 December 2014.
There are no such minimum funding requirements after this seven-year period, and the obligation is taken into account in the determination of the amount of any pension plan surplus recognized on the balance sheet.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2014.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2011, and a valuation as at 31 December 2014 is currently under way.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
