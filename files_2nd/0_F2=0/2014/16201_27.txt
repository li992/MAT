In order to assess whether tax claims should be provided for in the Financial Statements management has assessed all such claims in the context of the tax laws of the countries in which it operates.
Management has applied judgement in assessing the likely outcome of the tax claims and has estimated the financial impact based on external tax and legal advice and prior experience of such claims.

On completion of the Ugandan farm down in 2012, Tullow recognised $341.3 million of discounted contingent consideration due from Total and CNOOC as a non-current receivable.
The amount of contingent consideration recoverable is dependent on the timing of the receipt of certain project approvals.
Delays in receipt of the project approvals will result in a decrease on a straight-line basis of the amount recoverable.
During 2014 management has reassessed the likely date of receipt of the project approvals and has revised their best estimate that the approvals will be received in late 2016.
Management has exercised judgement in determining what event would trigger receipt of the contingent consideration and when this will occur.
Due to the contractual clauses associated with the contingent consideration a change to the estimated date of receipt of project approvals to late 2016 reduces the amount receivable to zero, triggering an income statement charge of $370 million which has been classified as a loss on disposal.

com 133 Financial Statements NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 Note 6.
Taxation on loss profit on ordinary activities continued The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $1,642.1 million 2013: $1,783.0 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised $72.0 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2013: $52.0 million : this is disclosed net of a deferred tax liability in respect of capitalised interest.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $21.2 million 2013: $24.5 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income During 2014 $91.0 million 2013: $0.1 million, credit of tax has been recognised through other comprehensive income of which $89.5 million 2013: $nil is current and $1.5m 2013: $0.1 million, credit is deferred tax relating to gains on cash flow hedges arising in the year.

Acquisitions of subsidiaries On 11 December 2012 Tullow announced that it had acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Spring Energy Norway AS Spring.
The acquisition of Spring added a portfolio of 28 offshore licences across Norways continental shelf in the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas.
The acquisition enables the Group to rapidly build a strong platform for future growth in Norway.
The transaction had an effective date of 1 September 2012 but completed on 22 January 2013 and this is therefore the acquisition date.

The following table summarises the techniques used to arrive at fair value and certain key assumptions.
Category Valuation technique Key inputs & assumptions 1 Goodwill n a n a 2 Intangible exploration and $ boe of risked $ boe of risked resources evaluation assets resources 2 Property, plant and equipment Discounted cash flow 2P reserves, forward oil curve, 10% discount rate Inventory Historical cost Historical cost of all inventory lower than NRV 3 Provisions Present value 4% discount rate, 2% inflation, operator cost estimate 4 Contingent consideration Discounted cash flow $ bbl of risked resources, 8% discount rate 5 All other items Carrying value The carrying value is equal to fair value 1.
The total purchase consideration equals the aggregate of the pre-tax fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Spring.
Given the nature of the oil and gas regime in Norway, the fair value of the business acquired has been determined based on the purchase price which is net of tax attributes.
As a consequence, the goodwill balance solely results from the requirement on an acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Further details regarding the key inputs and assumptions on the valuation of intangible exploration and evaluation assets and property, plant and equipment are disclosed in notes 11, 12 and 13.
Provisions represent the present value of decommissioning costs $18.6 million which are expected to be incurred up to 2025 and a $10.0 million liability on development of the PL407 licence.
The contingent consideration represents the fair value of a contingent amount payable to the previous owners of Spring.
The payable is calculated as $0.5 bbl to $1.0 bbl of recoverable resources recognised by four operated wells expected to be drilled in 2013 and 2014 and is capped at $300 million.
All other items includes other non-current assets, trade receivables, other current assets, current tax assets, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, other financial liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.
Other current financial liabilities at 31 December and at the acquisition date relate to Springs Exploration Finance Facility, which provides funding for 74% of Norwegian exploration costs secured against the exploration tax refund on exploration expenditure of 78%.

Delays in receipt of the project approvals would result in a decrease on a straight-line basis of the amount recoverable.
It is no longer probable that the project approvals will be received before the recoverable amount reduces to zero and as such the full balance of $370.1 million has been written off.
During 2014 the Group has made a payment of $36.6 million in respect of certain indemnities granted on the farm-down of Tullows interest in Uganda.
In 2014 the Group completed the disposal of Brage Norway and the farm-down of Schooner and Ketch UK for net cash consideration of $8.4 million and $38.1 million respectively.
Goodwill 2014 2013 $m $m At 1 January 350.5 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 9 350.5 Impairment 132.8 217.7 350.5 At 31 December Related deferred tax at 31 December 99.1 285.8 118.6 64.7 Total net asset impact after tax The Groups goodwill arose from acquisition of Spring Energy in 2013 note 9 and is allocated to the group of cashgenerating units CGUs that represent the assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The goodwill balance solely results from the requirement on an acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
As a result, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the related deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition are included in the group of CGUs.
The above table details the net impact of goodwill and the related deferred tax on the CGU.
The decrease in the related deferred tax from 2013 relates to the write-off of assets in 2014 on which the deferred tax arose at acquisition.
In assessing goodwill for impairment the Group has compared the carrying value of goodwill and the carrying value of the related group of CGUs with the recoverable amounts relating to those CGUs.
The carrying value of goodwill and the carrying value of the related group of CGUs was $419.8 million and the recoverable amount of the CGUs was $287.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $132.8 million.
The impairment was driven by a reduction in recoverable reserves and resources and a reduction in the dollar per boe value of assets reflecting reduced global oil prices.
Key assumptions The valuation techniques, methodology, inputs and assumptions used for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing performed as at 31 December 2014 are the same as those used as part of the IFRS 3 fair value allocation detailed in note 9.
Further details of how those key assumptions were calculated are summarised below: Recoverable reserves and resources Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice annually and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated 136 Tullow Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Accounts 136 Tullow Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Dollar per boe of risk resources For exploration prospects a dollar per boe $ boe valuation methodology was used, whereby value was ascribed to prospects based on an internal estimate of risked resources multiplied by a $ boe figure representing a likely sales case.
The $ boe was risked to reflect the proximity to existing infrastructure, subsurface risks and the likelihood of development from a recognised valuation of $2 boe for Norwegian North Sea prospects.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions As discussed above the principal assumptions are recoverable reserves and resources and the estimated dollar per boe of risk resources.
An average 100 mmboe reduction in risked resources, would result in a further impairment of $62.2 million.
An average $0.25 boe reduction in the estimated dollar per boe of risk resources would result in a further impairment of $112.4 million.

Assets classified as held for sale In September 2014, Tullow signed an agreement to sell its operated and non-operated interests in the L12 L15 area in the Netherlands along with non-operated interests in blocks Q4 and Q5 to AU Energy, a subsidiary of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.
This transaction is expected to complete early in 2015.
On 11 October 2013, Tullow signed a Sale and Purchase SPA agreement with Ocean Pakistan Limited, a part of the Hashoo Group, for the sale of Tullows 100% owned Pakistan subsidiary, Tullow Pakistan Developments Limited.
The SPA expired in 2014 and as a result the associated assets have been declassified as held for sale.
The Q&L Blocks are included in the Europe, South America and Asia segment.
The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale are as follows: Netherlands Pakistan Netherlands Pakistan 2014 2014 2013 2013 $m $m $m $m Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 40.4 25.2 Property, plant and equipment 95.2 Trade and other receivables 0.5 Other current assets 1.5 Cash and cash equivalents 16.0 Total assets classified as held for sale 135.6 43.2 Trade and other payables 17.7 Provisions 13.6 0.5 Total liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale 13.6 18.2 122.0 25.0 Net assets of disposal group Exploration write-back write-off recorded 5.1 5.1 Note 20.

Short-term borrowings and term loans are secured by fixed and floating charges over the oil and gas assets of the Group.
The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 7 November 2019, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
During the year the Company issued certain letters of credit under bilateral arrangements which released additional debt capacity under the facility.
In April 2014 the Company refinanced the $500 million Revolving credit facility, increasing commitments to $750 million and extending maturity until April 2017.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
Both the Reserves Based Lending credit facility and the Revolving Credit facility are subject to a financial leverage ratio.
The ratio, defined as net borrowings to EBITDAX, is calculated as of 30 June and 31 December each year.
In June 2014 the Company also refinanced the NOK 2,000 million Revolving Norwegian Exploration Finance facility, increasing commitments to NOK 3,000 million and extending availability until December 2017.
The facility is used to finance certain exploration activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf which are eligible for a tax refund.
The facility is available for drawings until 31 December 2017 and its final maturity date is either the date the 2017 tax reimbursement claims are received or 31 December 2018, whichever is the earlier.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at NIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2014, the headroom under the three facilities amounted to $2,263 million: $1,513 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $750 million under the Revolving credit facility.
At the end of December 2013, the headroom under the three facilities amounted to $2,403 million: $1,903 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $500 million under the Revolving credit facility.
In April 2014 the Company completed an offering of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due 2022.
As with the Companys November 2013 offering of $650 million of 6% senior notes due in 2020, interest on the notes is payable semi-annually.
All notes, whose net proceeds were used to repay certain existing indebtedness under the Companys credit facilities but not cancel commitments under such facilities, are senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Companys subsidiaries.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.
com 141 Financial Statements NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 Note 21.
Borrowings continued The movement from 2013 is attributable to higher external borrowings during 2014, principally as a result of the Groups $2,353.4 million capital expenditure, partially offset by operating cash flows.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group is exposed to a variety of risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering its underlying oil and gas businesses.
The Group holds a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as well as a portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of derivative financial instruments derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the senior notes, the Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The fair value of the senior notes, as determined using market values at 31 December 2014 was $1,101.3 million 2013: $665.0 million.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
No financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The following provides an analysis of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2013: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
142 Tullow Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Accounts 142 Tullow Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commodity price risk The Group uses a number of derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Dated Brent, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, daily field production performance.
Income statement hedge summary Net losses from commodity derivative settlements during the period, included in the income statement, were $14.5 million 2013: $56.0 million note 2.
Derivative fair value movements during the year which have been recognised in the income statement were as follows: 2014 2013 $m $m Profit loss on hedging instruments: Cash flow hedges Gas derivatives Time value 0.9 0.2 0.9 0.2 Oil derivatives Ineffectiveness 0.1 Time value 49.9 20.0 49.9 19.9 50.8 19.7 Total net profit loss for the year in the income statement Hedge reserve summary The hedge reserve represents the portion of deferred gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed to be effective cash flow hedges.

Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR and Norwegian NIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises senior notes, bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Group hedges its floating interest rate exposure www.

Financial instruments continued on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2014 is an asset of $0.4 million 2013: $2.3 million asset.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the table below.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2014 and 2013 was as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 2014 Fixed rate Floating rate 2014 2013 Fixed rate Floating rate 2013 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 216.6 1,600.0 1,522.4 2,905.8 258.2 1,000.0 927.2 1,669.0 Euro 16.8 16.8 14.8 14.8 Sterling 20.6 164.6 144.0 24.0 174.8 150.8 Other 65.0 134.9 69.9 55.9 159.4 103.5 319.0 1,600.0 1,821.9 3,102.9 352.9 1,000.0 1,261.4 1,908.5 Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Credit risk The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The primary credit exposures for the Group are its receivables generated by the marketing of crude oil.
These exposures are managed at the corporate level.
The Groups crude sales are predominantly made to international oil market participants including the oil majors, trading houses and refineries.
Counterparty evaluations are conducted utilising international credit rating agency and financial assessment.
Where considered appropriate security in the form of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance is employed to mitigate the risks.
The Group generally enters into derivative agreements with banks who are lenders under the Reserves Based Lending credit facility.
Security is provided under the facility agreement which mitigates non-performance risk.
The Group does not have other significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, current tax assets and other current assets, as at 31 December 2014 was $2,126.1 million 2013: $1,908.7 million.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also mainly denominated in Sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are often managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives.
There were no material foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2014 year-end 2013: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2014, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $54.3 million in non-US dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents 2013: $37.3 million and 106.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2013: 106.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $110.4 million 2013: net liabilities of $137.5 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk using both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capacity and flexibility of the Group.
The Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible changes as described above, show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have significant financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.

A review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist in 2014 which has been used for the purposes of the 2014 Financial Statements.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Decommissioning cost estimates have been inflated to the date of decommissioning at 2% and discounted back to the year end at 3%.
Other provisions include a liability acquired through the acquisition of Spring note 9 which is contingent in terms of timing and amount on the development of the PL407 licence in Norway.
Other provisions also include the contingent consideration in respect of the Spring acquisition note 9.
The amount recorded as at 31 December 2013 was $131.2 million and subsequent information provided through drilling results during 2014 has resulted in a reduction of the provision by $88.8 million note 12.
This was offset by an increase in other provisions of $6.7 million.
The unwind of other provisions is recorded against the intangible asset they relate to.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

The size of awards depends on both annual performance measures and Total Shareholder Return TSR over a period of up to three years.
There are no post-grant performance conditions.
No dividends are paid over the vesting period, however an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the TIP shares during the vesting period if they were real shares, will also be payable on exercise of the award.
No dividends are paid over the vesting period.

The 2010 SOP was replaced by the ESAP for grants from 2014.
During 2013 phantom options were granted under the 2010 SOP to replace certain options granted under the 2000 ESOS that lapsed as a result of performance conditions not being satisfied.
These replacement phantom options provide a cash bonus equivalent to the gain that could be made from a share option being granted over a notional number of shares with a notional exercise price.
Phantom options have also been granted under the 2010 SOP and the 2000 ESOS in situations where the grant of share options was not practicable.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had exercise prices of 157p to 1530p 2013: 103p to 1530p and remaining contractual lives between 5 months and 9 years.
The weighted average remaining contractual life is 5.9 years.
UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs These are all-employee plans set up in the UK and Ireland, to enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the SIP trustees to buy Tullow shares Partnership Shares at the end of each three-month accumulation period.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
Under the UK SIP, Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value when it is awarded.
Under the UK SIP: i Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of their market values at the start of the accumulation period and the purchase date which is treated as a three-month share option for IFRS 2 purposes and therefore results in an accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the three years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
Under the Irish SIP: i Partnership Shares are bought at the market value at the purchase date which does not result in any accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the two years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.

Subsequent events In January 2015, Tullow announced the results of the Ngamia-6 and Amosing-3 appraisal wells.
Ngamia-6 was drilled to a final depth of 2,480 metres encountering up to 135 metres of net oil pay.
The Amosing-3 well in Block 10BB continued the successful appraisal of the Amosing oil field.
The well successfully encountered over 107 metres of net oil pay in good quality reservoir sands.
The well reached a final depth of 2,403 metres and has been suspended for use in future appraisal and development activities.
In January 2015, Tullow also announced completion of the Epir-1 exploration well located in block 10BB in the North Kerio Basin.
Whilst not a discovery, the well encountered oil and wet gas shows over a 100 metre interval of non-reservoir quality rocks, demonstrating a working petroleum system in this lacustrine sub-basin.
