For options issued in, and subsequent to, 2011, the fair value was based upon the Monte-Carlo simulation of the performance of the Companys share price against the ATSR conditions specified in the award, using the assumptions included above.
Expected volatility for each Company was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the individual Companys share price over the 3 years from the date of grant.
Retention Awards and Starter Awards The fair value was based upon the share price on the date of grant.
Performance Awards For awards issued from 2009 onwards, the fair value was based on the share price on the date of grant as the performance conditions were market based.
ESPP scheme The fair value of the ESPP is based on the maximum cash value that each participant is eligible to accrue under the scheme rules.
Share Option Charges The Group recognised total expenses of $22,612,000 2013: $29,650,000: 2012: $24,480,000 related to equitysettled share-based payment transactions.
Modication of equity-settled share-based payment charges During the period, certain share options and share awards which had been granted as equity settled share-based payments were modied so that they would instead be settled by a cash payment.
Under IFRS 2, where a cash payment is to be made to settle an equity settled share-based payment, this should be treated as a repurchase of equity instruments.
Accordingly, $1,813,000 has been deducted from the share-based payment reserve, reecting the fair value of the cash liability on the modication date.
