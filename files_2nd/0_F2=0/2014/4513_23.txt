Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Group has two business units, Currency and Solutions.
Currency is a single operating unit.
Solutions consists of three operating units: Cash Processing Solutions, Security Products and Identity Systems.
The Board, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker, monitors the performance of the Group at an operating unit level and there are therefore four reportable segments.
The principal financial information reviewed by the Board, is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis.
The Groups segments are: Currency Provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and banknote security components Solutions Cash Processing Solutions primarily focused on the production of large banknote sorters and authentication machines for central banks, complementing the Currency business Security Products produces security documents, including authentication labels, brand licensing products, government documents, cheques and postage stamps Identity Systems involved in the provision of passport, ePassport, national ID and eID, driving licence and voter registration schemes Inter-segmental transactions are carried out on an arms length basis and eliminated upon consolidation.

This brings the cumulative exceptional charges taken in respect of the Improvement Plan to a total of 35.2m.
In addition, 1.1m of charges were incurred in connection with the preparation of bids for the supply of products or services under multi year arrangements, 2.2m of charges with regard to the resolution of an overseas historic indirect tax liability, 1.0m of legal and professional fees incurred in relation to an aborted acquisition and 14.2m in relation to tangible and intangible asset impairments.
These costs were partly offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets in the year of 4.5m.
The net cash cost of exceptional items in the year was 4.0m.
Following a detailed review of the individual cash generating units within the CPS business and the performance of the business as a whole, impairment charges of 14.2m 7.4m: development intangibles, 3.2m: goodwill intangibles and 3.6m: tangible assets have been recognised.
This is a consequence of lower expectations of future trading performance, informed by the poor trading result reported in the current financial year.
These lower expectations, and hence lower forecast cash inflows, reflect the benefit of the targeted breakeven plan for 2014 15 but also recognise the continuing challenging environment for CPS.

5 Taxation The tax expense included in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, including adjustments in respect of prior periods, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, not deductible for tax purposes, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities, they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle a liability simultaneously.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of the dilutive effect of share options.

Assets in the course of construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives of 50 years.
Other leasehold interests are depreciated over the lesser of the unexpired period of the lease and 50 years.
The Groups policy is to write off the cost or valuation of all other plant and equipment evenly over their estimated remaining useful life at rates which vary between 4 per cent and 50 per cent per annum.
The principal annual rate of depreciation used is 10 per cent on plant and machinery and on fixtures and fittings.
No depreciation is provided for assets in the course of construction.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end, taking into account commercial and technical obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, provision being made where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the Groups share of the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
At the date of acquisition, the goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment or when there are indications of impairment.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill, and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is presented in investments in associates.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 27 March 2004 the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, are capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over the shorter of their useful economic life or their licence period at rates which vary between three and five years.
Expenditure incurred in the development of products or enhancements to existing product ranges is capitalised as an intangible asset only when the future economic benefits expected to arise are deemed probable and the costs can be reliably measured.
Development costs not meeting these criteria are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which vary between 5 and 10 years, once the product or enhancement is available for use.
Product research costs are written off as incurred.
Distribution rights are capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses and are amortised over their useful economic lives as determined by the life of the products to which they relate.

If any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
In addition, goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.
Impairment tests are performed for all Cash Generating Units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated at the balance sheet date or whenever there is indication of impairment.
For all other intangible assets, an impairment test is performed whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, the latter being the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use and, in the case of goodwill, is not subsequently reversed.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For other intangible assets, at each balance sheet date an assessment is made to determine whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or has decreased.
Where such an indication exists, an impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the assets carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs identified according to business segment and country of operation.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2014 2013 m m Currency 4.3 4.3 Cash Processing Solutions CPS 3.5 4.3 7.8 The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and CPS on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
As a result of the worsening trading performance of the CPS operation reported in 2013 14, in addition to the annual review of the intangible goodwill, the value of the CPS CGU as a whole has been tested for impairment.
Following this review, impairment charges of 14.2m were recorded with respect to the CPS operation.
Of the total charge, 3.2m related to goodwill, 7.4m to development intangible assets and 3.6m was allocated to property, plant and equipment across the CPS business.
The estimates of recoverable amounts are based on value in use calculations which utilise cash flow projections covering a five year period using the latest projections approved by management plus a terminal value.
Cash flows beyond the period covered by the projections have been held constant.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Currency: The volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i Expectations in respect of economic growth and the banknote circulation policies of central banks ii The Groups knowledge of its customer base, gained through its long standing relationships with them b CPS: Unit sales of medium and large sorters and the extent of maintenance service income generated from these sales are based on a combination of orders on hand, past experience and expectations of future demand The pre-tax discount rate used for Currency was 13 per cent 2012 13: 13 per cent and for Cash Processing Solutions was 10 per cent 2012 13: 13 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital, the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations and the level of risk inherent in the forward projections.
The Directors do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that would result in a different conclusion being reached with regards to the impairment of the CPS CGU, or the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of the Currency CGU.

Cost is determined on a weighted average cost basis and comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs, including direct labour and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity that have been incurred in bringing those inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.

The Group also reversed provisions of 2.0m 2012 13: 2.5m, being provisions against inventory that was subsequently utilised or sold.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2014 2013 m m Balance at beginning of year 4.5 4.7 Impairment losses recognised 0.9 1.9 Impairment losses reversed 2.0 2.1 Balance at end of year 3.4 4.5 Amounts can go past due before collection in situations where the customer may have raised queries over contractual compliance.
Such issues arise in the normal course of business and are routinely addressed to the satisfaction of the customer.
The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historic payment behaviour and analysis of customer credit risk, including underlying customers credit ratings if they are available.
fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 83 Notes to the accounts continued 12 Financial risk Financial risk management Overview The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk.
The Groups financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups risk management policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Groups treasury department is responsible for the management of these financial risks faced by the Group.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
Group treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities where due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents.
The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Groups planning process.
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings is shown below in the reporting of financial risk section together with associated fair values.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The Group uses a range of derivative instruments, including forward contracts and swaps to hedge its risk to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates with the objective of controlling market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes.
a Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Groups policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated in overseas subsidiaries.
b Interest rate risk All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of net debt above 50m on a continuing basis, floating to fixed interest rate swaps have been used to fix the interest rate on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups forecast average levels of net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.
Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 84 Strategic report Directors report Accounts 12 Financial risk continued Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The gain or loss on subsequent fair value measurement is recognised in the income statement unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement.
However, if the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts accumulated in equity on the hedging instrument are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, for forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Fair value hedges For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in net income.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative or, for non-derivatives, the foreign currency component of its carrying value, are recognised in net income.
Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Any unrealised gains or losses on such separated derivatives are reported in the income statement.

The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values.
Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject to management estimates.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves in effect at the balance sheet date.
fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 85 Notes to the accounts continued 12 Financial risk continued Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Determination of fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities Non-derivative financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest, are recognised in profit or loss.
Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Non-derivative financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Included within the Groups net debt are cash and cash equivalent balances that are not readily available for use by the Group.
These balances are not significant, and are not readily available due to restrictions within some of the countries in which we operate.
Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Boards view, summarise best whether the Groups objectives regarding equity management are being met.
The Groups earnings and dividends per share and relative rates of growth illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed.
Both measures are disclosed and discussed within the strategic report and notes 6 and 7.
The Groups objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share.
fide La Rues dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy.
The dividend per share objective is monitored against the target of a full year dividend cover of 1.75 times underlying earnings.
The proposed total dividend for the year is covered 1.45 times.
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial position, capital requirements, general business conditions, cash flows, net debt levels and share buyback plans.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.

fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 93 Notes to the accounts continued 19 Share based payments The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled option schemes.
For equity settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the numbers of shares that are actually expected to vest, taking into account non-market vesting conditions including service conditions.
Vesting conditions, other than non-market based conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability for options outstanding and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
At 29 March 2014, the Group has a number of share based payment plans, which are described below.
These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, which means that IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of employee share based payments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 and cash settled awards outstanding at 1 January 2005.
The compensation cost and related liability that have been recognised for the Groups share based plans are set out in the table below: Expense recognised for the year Liability at end of year 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Annual Bonus Plan 0.5 0.7 Deferred Bonus and Matching Share Plan 1.0 Performance Share Plan 1.4 3.6 Recruitment Share Award 0.1 0.1 Retention Share Award 0.1 0.1 Savings Related Share Option Scheme 0.6 0.3 US Employee Share Purchase Plan 0.5 3.8 The fair value of share options is estimated at the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model.

This rate is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.

The assets of the Groups plans are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
The major schemes are defined benefit pension funds with assets held separately from the Group.
The major defined benefit pension funds are based in the UK and are now closed to future accrual, with all members being deferred members or pensioners.
The cost of providing benefits under each scheme is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating costs in the Group income statement.
The interest income on the plan assets of funded defined benefit pension schemes and the imputed interest on pension scheme liabilities are disclosed as retirement benefit obligation net finance expense respectively in the income statement.
Return on plan assets excluding interest income on the assets, changes in the retirement benefit obligation due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, as determined by actuarial valuations carried out at the balance sheet date.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.

The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation for the UK plan are based on tables issued by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
At 29 March 2014 mortality assumptions were based on the SAPS All lives tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI model, CMI 2011 and a long term rate of 1.0 per cent per annum.
This assumption is unchanged from that used as at 30 March 2013.
The resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2014 2013 Aged 65 retiring immediately current pensioner Male 22.2 22.2 Female 24.6 24.5 Aged 50 retiring in 17 years future pensioner Male 21.5 23.2 Female 23.9 25.7 The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the following main risks: Mortality risk an increase in the life expectancy of members will increase the liabilities of the schemes.
The mortality assumptions are reviewed regularly, and are considered appropriate.
Interest rate risk A decrease in bond yields will increase the liabilities of the scheme.
Liability driven investment strategies are used to hedge part of this risk.
Investment risk The pension schemes invest in a range of assets to mitigate the risk of any single asset class, and align growth and returns to the long term funding objectives.
The investment strategy is reviewed regularly to ensure it continues to be appropriate.
Inflation risk The liabilities of the scheme are linked to inflation.
An increase in inflation will result in an increase in liabilities.
There are caps in place for UK scheme benefits to mitigate the risk of extreme increases in inflation.
Any increase in the retirement benefit obligation could lead to additional funding obligations in future years.
The Group has agreed deficit funding to the scheme of 17.5m for 2014 15, rising by 4 per cent per annum until 2022.
The table below provides the sensitivity of the liability in the scheme to changes in various assumptions: Assumption change Approximate impact on liability 0.25% decrease in discount rate Increase in liability of c38m 0.25% increase in RPI inflation rate Increase in liability of c28m Increasing the underpin from 1% to 1.5% pa Increase in liability of c25m Increasing life expectancy by one year Increase in liability of c13m fide La Rue Annual Report 2014 98 Strategic report Directors report Accounts 22 Retirement benefit obligations continued The largest defined benefit pension plan operated by the Group is in the UK.

The Group provides guarantees and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business.
In the event that a guarantee or bond is called, provision may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an assessment of its recoverability.
In July 2010 the Board commissioned an investigation by external lawyers into issues that had been brought to its attention internally.
The investigation, which was completed in October 2010, found nothing of substance to support the matters raised other than in respect of some paper production issues where it was found that a small number of the many detailed specification parameters of some paper had fallen marginally short of specification.
It was also established that certain paper specification test certificates had been deliberately falsified.
The Board reported the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, who are considering the matter, and has implemented a number of measures arising from the findings of the investigation.
Provision has been made in prior years for the costs associated with the paper production issues identified at this stage including the write off of trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation, production and rectification of these matters.
Provision has not been made for the potential cost of resolutions or for potential fines from regulatory authorities.
The nature and extent of these resolutions will be the subject of ongoing discussions, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present.
The timing, response and outcome of the consideration by the authorities of the reported findings of the investigation is also uncertain and the financial consequences, if any, cannot be estimated reliably at present.
