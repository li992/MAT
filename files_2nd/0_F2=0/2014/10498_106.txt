Key assumptions The recoverable amounts of the Groups cash-generating units are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions inthe value-in-use calculations are: Cash flow forecasts which are derived from the budgets most recently approved by the Boards covering the three-year period to 31December 2017.
Sales volumes, sales prices and variable input cost assumptions in the budget period are derived from a combination of economic forecasts for the regions in which the Group operates, industry forecasts for individual product lines, internal management projections, historical performance and announced industry capacity changes.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management projections taking into consideration industry forecasts and growth rates in the regions in which the Group operates.
In general, such growth rates are assumed to be zero, but for Consumer Packaging, a growth rate of 2% is applied for each of the following five years beyond the budget period and zero thereafter into perpetuity.
Capital expenditure forecasts are based on historical experience and include expenditure necessary to maintain the projected cash flows from operations at current operating levels.
The pre tax discount rate is derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
In determining the discount rate applicable to each cash-generating unit, adjustments are made to reflect the impacts of country risk and tax.
Sensitivity analyses Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
Sensitivity analyses of reasonably possible changes in the underlying assumptions included: 1% increase in discount rate: 0% growth rate assumed in Consumer Packaging: and 5% decrease in cash flows.
None of these downside sensitivity analyses indicated the need for an impairment.
