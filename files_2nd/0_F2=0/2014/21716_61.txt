Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2014 11 DISCOUNT MANAGEMENT PROVISION continued If such continuation vote is not passed, the Directors will be required to formulate redemption proposals to be put to the Shareholders of that class offering to redeem their Ordinary Shares at the relevant published NAV on the NAV Calculation Date immediately preceding such redemption less the costs of all such redemptions.
However, where one or more such resolutions in respect of the same period is are not passed and the class es of Ordinary Shares involved represent 75 per cent, or more of the Companys net assets attributable to all Ordinary Shares at the last NAV Calculation Date on or immediately preceding the date of the latest continuation resolution being defeated, the Directors may first at their discretion put forward alternative proposals to all Shareholders to offer to repurchase their shares or to reorganise, reconstruct or wind up the Company.
If, however, such alternative proposals are not passed by the necessary majority of shareholders of the relevant class, the Directors must proceed to offer to redeem the relevant class es of Ordinary Shares on the terms described above.
Where following redemption of any class of Ordinary Shares under the discount management provision, the number of Ordinary Shares of that class remaining in issue represent less than 25 per cent, of the Ordinary Shares of that class in issue immediately before such redemption or the listing for such class of Ordinary Shares on the Official List is withdrawn or threatened to be withdrawn or the Directors determine that the conditions for the continued listing of that class are not or they believe will not be met, then the Company may redeem the remaining issued Ordinary Shares of that class within three months of such determination at a redemption price equal to the NAV of the Ordinary Shares of that class on the NAV Calculation Date selected by the Directors for such purpose less the costs or such redemption.
On 27 June 2014 the Company announced the proposed closure of the Euro Class.
The Board advised that given the small size and lack of liquidity of the Euro Class it would be offering Euro Class shareholders the opportunity to convert into US Dollar or Sterling Shares and then seeking consent to cancel the listing on the official list of the UK Listing Authority of the Euro Class and to redeem all of the Euro Class shares then in issue.
The Company issued a Circular dated 4 August 2014 to its shareholders, inviting them to vote on the proposed closure of the Euro Class.
On 27 August 2014 at an Extraordinary General Meeting and Euro Class meeting, 97.98% of the voting shareholders voted in favour of the closure of the Euro Class.
As a result the remaining Euro Class shares were redeemed on 1 October 2014 and the Euro Class shares were cancelled from the London Stock Exchange effective 2 October 2014.
