Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings or cross-currency swaps in the relevant foreign currency.
