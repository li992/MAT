Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.9 Retirement bene ts obligations We operate a number of fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution pension plans for our employees.
The Groups largest fide ned bene t scheme is the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF in the UK.
We agreed a new funding agreement with the Trustees of the CWSF in May 2014.
Accounting policy detailed in note 5.1.
1 Retirement bene ts obligations The Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.
These schemes include both fide ned bene t schemes, where retirement bene ts are based on employees remuneration and length of service, and fide ned contribution schemes, where retirement bene ts re ect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Contributions to the fide ned bene t schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund Cable & Wireless Communications operates the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF.
This plan provides fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution arrangements for current and former employees of the Group.
The CWSF has been closed to new fide ned bene t members since 1998.
Regulatory framework and governance The assets of the CWSF are held in trustee-administered funds governed by UK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees.
Responsibility for the governance of the CWSF, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the Board of Trustees who must consult with the Group on such matters.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent Trustee in accordance with the CWSFs governing documents.
The weighted average duration of the total expected bene t payments from the CWSF is 15 years, and the weighted average duration of the expected uninsured bene t payments from the CWSF is 21 years.
Funding arrangements The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the CWSF was carried out by independent actuaries Towers Watson Limited as at 31 March 2010.
The March 2010 actuarial valuation showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to meet the future bene t accrual was 38.4% of pensionable earnings 33.4% employers and 5.0% employees.
This contribution rate will be reviewed when the next triennial valuation is nalised.
The terms of the CWSF Trust Deed also allow the Trustees or the Company to call for a valuation at any time.
Cable & Wireless Communications paid a total contribution of US$2 million in 2013 14 2012 13 US$2 million to the CWSF.
A fide cit recovery funding plan was also agreed with the Trustees during March 2011 as part of the March 2010 actuarial valuation with the aim that the fide cit would be eliminated by April 2016.
The payments under this agreement will be: July 2014 30 million US$50 million : April 2015 31 million US$51 million : and April 2016 33 million US$54 million.
As at 31 March 2014, the March 2013 actuarial valuation was ongoing.
Subsequent to the year end in May 2014, the Group reached agreement with the Trustees on the valuation which showed a funding fide cit of 109 million as at 31 March 2013.
The agreed payments for 2014 to 2016 will remain as agreed following the March 2010 valuation.
Payments in 2017, 2018 and 2019 will be based on the outcome of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016 and will be in the range of 0-23 million each year as necessary to fund the scheme by April 2019.
No adjustment has been made to these accounts to re ect this post balance sheet event.
The best estimate of contributions to the CWSF for 2014 15 is US$53 million for employer contributions, which includes the July 2014 funding payment agreed with the Trustees.
Minimum funding requirement The fide cit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees of the CWSF as part of the March 2010 actuarial valuation, which was applicable at 31 March 2014, constitutes a minimal funding requirement.
An adjustment to the fide cit in the CWSF to account for the minimum funding requirement has been calculated in accordance with IFRIC 14 The limits on a fide ned bene t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
The adjustment to the fide cit, which is recorded in other comprehensive income, was US$22 million as at 31 March 2014 2012 13 US$29 million.
120 Cable & Wireless Communications Asset-liability matching During 2008, the CWSF Trustees agreed an insurance buy-in of the UK pensioner liabilities with Prudential Insurance.
The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the CWSF under which Prudential Insurance assumed responsibility for the bene ts payable to the CWSFs UK pensioners.
In December 2011, a further 233 pensioners, having commenced with pensions in payment since the original annuity, were brought within the bulk annuity policy.
These pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the CWSF.
Approximately 71% of the liabilities 2012 13 73% in the CWSF are matched by the annuity policy asset which reduces the funding risk for the Group.
UK unfunded pension arrangements The Group operates unfunded fide ned bene t arrangements in the UK.
These primarily relate to pension provisions for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap.
The arrangements are governed by individual trust deeds.
One arrangement incorporates a covenant requiring the Group to hold security against the value of the liabilities.
The security is in the form of UK Government gilts which are held separately as available for sale assets note 4.4.
The weighted average duration of the expected bene t payments from the unfunded arrangements is 15 years.
Overseas schemes The Group operates other fide ned bene t pension schemes in Jamaica and Barbados.
The schemes are closed to new entrants and the Jamaican scheme is also closed to future accrual.
The schemes are governed by local pension laws and regulations.
The Jamaican scheme owns an insurance policy which matches in full the value of the fide ned bene t liabilities.
When fide ned bene t funds have an IAS 19 surplus, they are recorded at the lower of that surplus and the future economic bene ts available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions.
Any adjustment to the surplus net of interest is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The eff ect of these adjustments, described as asset ceiling adjustments, were US$22 million as at 31 March 2014 31 March 2013 US$15 million and relate to the Groups fide ned bene t arrangements in Jamaica.
The maximum economic bene t was determined by reference to the reductions in future contributions available to the Group.
The best estimate of contributions to the overseas schemes for 2014 15 is US$2 million for employer contributions and US$2 million for employee contributions.
IAS 19 Employee bene ts valuation Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and other schemes The IAS 19 valuations of the major fide ned bene t pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated to 31 March 2014 by quali ed independent actuaries.
Lane, Clark & Peacock LLP prepared the valuation for the CWSF and the UK unfunded arrangements.
Towers Watson Limited reviewed the IAS 19 valuations prepared for all remaining schemes.
The main financial assumptions applied in the valuations and an analysis of schemes assets are as follows: 31 March 2014 31 March 2013 Overseas Overseas CWSF UK unfunded schemes CWSF UK unfunded schemes assumption assumption assumption assumption assumption assumption % % % % % % Signi cant actuarial assumptions: RPI in ation assumption 3.3 3.3 4.4 3.3 3.3 5.0 Discount rate 4.3 4.3 8.7 4.2 4.2 8.9 Discount rate CWSF uninsured liability 4.4 4.5 Other related actuarial assumptions: CPI in ation assumption 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Salary increases 3.8 5.4 3.8 5.3 Pension increases 2.1-3.2 2.7 2.1-3.2 2.7 Increases to pensions are primarily linked to RPI in ation before and aft er retirement.

The assumptions shown above for other schemes represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes.
The assumptions regarding current mortality rates in retirement for the CWSF and UK unfunded schemes were set having regard to the actual experience of the CWSFs pensioners and dependants over the six years ended 31 December 2012.
In addition, allowance was made for future mortality improvements in line with the 2012 CMI core projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.
These are the mortality rates used for calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The mortality rates used for the gure in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2014 are updated from those which were used for calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners aged 60 are as follows: On On On 31 March 31 March 31 March 2014 2024 2034 years years years CWSF and UK unfunded: Male pensioners and dependants 28.6 29.8 31.1 Female pensioners 28.1 29.3 30.6 Female dependants 31.2 32.2 33.5 Risks Through its fide ned bene t pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most signi cant of which are detailed below.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be signi cantly in uenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or fide cit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group, principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by quali ed actuaries and investment advisors: Investment returns: The Groups net balance sheet, and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes: Longevity: The cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements: and In ation rate risk: In the UK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to in ation, and higher in ation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the CWSFs population and all of the Jamaican schemes liabilities through the purchase of insurance policies, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
Remaining investment risks in the CWSF have also been mitigated to some extent by diversi cation of the return-seeking assets.
122 Cable & Wireless Communications In addition, the fide ned bene t obligation as measured under IAS 19 is linked to yields on AA rated corporate bonds, however the majority of the Groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a diff erent manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.

The impact on the net liability is signi cantly reduced for the CWSF scheme as a result of the annuity policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the signi cantly higher impact on the fide ned bene t obligation.
The methods used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
Using the projected unit method for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

2 Restatement for IAS 19 Employee bene ts 2011 The Group adopted IAS 19 Employee bene ts 2011 on 1 April 2013 and as required by the standard applied it retrospectively by restating comparative numbers for 2012 13.
The revisions made to IAS 19 Employee bene ts 2011 requires net interest expense income to be calculated as the product of the net fide ned liability asset, including any minimum funding liability or asset ceiling, and the discount rate as determined at the beginning of the year.
The eff ect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets.
In addition, actual administration expenses incurred by the plans are recognised through the income statement.
As a result, the Group recorded a net increase in operating expense and a reduction in pro t for the year and EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2014 of US$10 million 2012 13 US$8 million.
Corresponding movements in actuarial gains losses have been recognised in other comprehensive income.
There is no impact on total comprehensive income for the year.
This has had a negative impact on continuing EPS of US0.4 cents 2012 13 US0.4 cents.
There is no impact on the balance sheet in either year.
