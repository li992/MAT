a. UK schemes: benefits, governance, cash flow obligations and investments The Group operates three main defined benefit Final Salary pension schemes in the UK which are all closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The schemes are the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme comprising the Group, Motors, Normand and Cash sections, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
Cash is a defined benefit Cash Balance scheme which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
Benefit structure Final Salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash Balance schemes like the Inchcape Cash Pension scheme allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
Governance Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits are paid to members from separate funds administered by Independent Trustees who are appointed by the Group.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interest of the members, and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
Scheme specific cash obligation investment detail Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme Group and Motors closed schemes The latest actuarial valuations for these sections were carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years and that a small surplus existed on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.5m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and no further review is scheduled until April 2016.
The investment strategy is to hold 65% of bonds which hedge inflation and interest rate risk, with the remaining 35% held in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
Investment performance in excess of that assumed in the valuation is captured by increasing the proportion of hedging assets.
Normand Pension Scheme closed scheme Prior to merger into the Inchcape Motors Pensions Scheme, an actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2014 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 20 years and that the scheme was approximately 90% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.4m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and improving the funding ratio.
The investment strategy is to hold 60% in growth assets and 40% in matching assets.
The Normand Scheme was merged into the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme on a sectionalised basis by a deed dated 30 September 2014.
In accordance with requirements the next actuarial valuation is scheduled to take place before 30 September 2015.
Inchcape Cash Pension Scheme This scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013.
An interim valuation was carried out at 5 April 2013 which determined that the scheme was considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
The Group contributes 0.2m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2016.
The investment strategy is to be 60% invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
The remaining 40% is to be allocated to absolute return bonds.
com 101 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is subject to most UK regulations.
It is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 13 years and that the scheme was approximately 92% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.5m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and no further review is scheduled until April 2015.
Investments are held in a balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
TKM Group Pension Scheme closed scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities is approximately 12 years and that the scheme is considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
No cash contributions are required by the Group and the next review is scheduled for April 2016.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy with a swap overlay in place to fully hedge inflation and interest rate risks.
Approximately 15% of the assets are invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 5.6m 2013 6.3m.
There are no outstanding contributions to the defined contribution schemes at the year end 2013 nil.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 23.8 years 2013 23.7 years for current pensioners and 25.6 years 2013 25.5 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.

com 105 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
e. Risk management Asset volatility Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold approximately 70% of assets as defensive assets gilts, bonds, swaps which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Group reduces the level of investment risk by investing more in government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations, and approximately 50% of the Groups total inflation risk is hedged through holding inflation-linked assets such as gilts and swaps.
Life expectancy The plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The trustees of the scheme hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
f. Sensitivity analysis The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligation United Kingdom 2014 2013 % % Discount rate -0.25% 4.2 4.0 Discount rate 0.25% -3.9 -3.8 Inflation -0.25% -3.4 -3.4 Inflation 0.25% 3.6 3.6 Mortality -1 year 3.3 3.3 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
g. Expected future cash flows The Group has agreed to pay approximately 1.8m 2013 1.6m to its defined benefit plans in 2015.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

110 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 110 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs or group of CGUs hereafter collectively referred to as CGU groups that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination.
These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
Unless otherwise stated, the Group evaluates goodwill in CGU groupings at a country operation level, e. g. UK Retail, Australia Retail.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: 2014 2013 m m United Kingdom 262.1 262.1 Emerging Markets 79.6 202.1 South Asia 19.7 19.4 Australasia 41.2 42.3 402.6 525.9 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2014.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
The growth rates used vary between 2% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 13% and reflect long-term country risk.
com 111 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Intangible assets continued The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those reporting segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Long-term Discount rate growth rate United Kingdom 10% 2% Emerging Markets 10% to 13% 5% South Asia 10% 2% Australasia 11% 2% Impairment Given the geopolitical uncertainty in the Russian market, the Group has reassessed its short and medium-term forecasts and recognised an impairment charge of 47.4m in 2014.
The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation for Russia was 12.5% 2013: 11.6% and the long-term growth rate was 4.5% 2013: 5.0%.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long-term growth rates.
In addition, the value in use calculation of our business in Russia is particularly sensitive to a change in longterm Vehicle gross margin assumptions.
With the exception of the Groups businesses in Russia and Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the other CGU groups.
The Groups goodwill in the Emerging Markets segment at 31 December 2014 is allocated as follows: Impairment Net book Cost provision value m m m Russia 104.6 47.4 57.2 Latvia 40.9 40.9 Lithuania 20.2 20.2 Other 2.4 0.2 2.2 At 31 December 2014 168.1 88.5 79.6 The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill in Russia and determined that an impairment charge of 47.4m is required.
In determining the impairment charge, the Directors have assumed an increase in Vehicle gross margin to 7.4% in 2019.
The remaining carrying value of goodwill in Russia is 57.2m.
A further 0.5% reduction in our gross margin assumption for 2019 would result in a further impairment charge of 20m.
Similarly, a further 0.5% reduction in long-term growth rate or a 0.5% increase in discount rate would result in a further impairment charge of 9m or 11m respectively.
In light of the sensitivity of the value in use calculations for Russia to changes in key assumptions, the Directors intend to revisit these calculations at the half year.
The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 23%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom to approximately 12% of the carrying value.

The key territory holding the losses is the UK.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The vast majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost.
There are a small number of territories that do not qualify for this treatment but the annual profits for these territories are self assessed for UK current tax each year and hence no deferred tax accrues.
If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate effect, a tax charge of 1.9m 2013 3.5m would be payable.
As the overseas reserves are anticipated to be repatriated within 12 months, the provision has been made to current tax.
The 7.3m 2013 11.4m net deferred tax liability for other timing differences consists of a 20.3m 2013 28.4m liability in respect of the net book value of tangible fixed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations and a net 13.0m 2013 17.0m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base.

com 123 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable netting arrangements or similar agreements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities if the amounts relate to the same transaction and are in the same currency.
If the parties subject to the agreement do not elect to settle on a net basis, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
However, each party to the netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of a default of the other party.
c. Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
d. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2014, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on bank borrowings, supplier related finance and cash balances as at 31 December 2014 with all other variables held constant.

Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units functional currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group, these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australasia, which purchases vehicles and parts in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39, hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2014 Yen 10% Yen -10% 2013 Yen 10% 0.5 Yen -10% 0.5 f. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 368.9m 2013 290.3m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.
g. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Refer to the Strategic Report on page 36 for discussion of liquidity risks to the Group.

Fair value measurement In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2014 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 102.6 102.6 106.2 106.2 Available for sale financial assets 1.4 1.4 9.7 9.7 1.4 102.6 104.0 9.7 106.2 115.9 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 29.9 29.9 41.4 41.4 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2014.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swap 100.1 89.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts 2.5 16.4 29.9 41.4 102.6 106.2 29.9 41.4 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounted to a gain of 1.5m 2013 gain of 2.3m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to a gain of nil 2013 nil.
com 127 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2013 15 months.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2014 was 746.0m 2013 760.4m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2014 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 15 months of the end of the reporting period 2013 15 months.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2014, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m, which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps, the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays GBP LIBOR 85bps and GBP LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after the debt reduction in 2009 to offset the non-required portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap, the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives GBP LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Capital management The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2014 2013 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 112.2 149.6 Net debt to EBITDA times n a n a Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a n a Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings.
Calculated as net debt earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Calculated as net debt market capitalisation as at 31 December.
