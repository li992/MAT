Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine Sabinas, a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million.
In addition, a per ounce cash payment of US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013 is payable to Peoles.
The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2014 was US$5.05 per ounce 2013: US$5 per ounce.
Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver.
If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.
The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate.
Changes in the contracts fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement.
In the year ended 31 December 2014 total proceeds received in cash were US$58.7 million 2013: US$63.8 million of which, US$8.1 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2013 2013: US$11.0 million.
Cash received in respect of the year of US$50.6 million 2013: US$52.8 million corresponds to 4.1 million ounces of payable silver 2013: 3.5 million ounces.
As at 31 December 2014, a further US$6.9 million 2013: US$8.1 million of cash corresponding to 638,681 ounces of silver is due 2013: 560,465 ounces.
The most significant drivers of the US$77.1 million unrealised gain taken to income statement 2013: US$54.0 million loss were the updating of assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract.
The most significant of these were an increase of the Sabinas mine silver reserves, the decrease of the reference discount rate LIBOR and the difference between the payments already received in 2014 and payments estimated in the valuation model as of 31 December 2013.
These were partially offset by a decrease in the forward price of silver which was lower than the previous year.
