GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 119 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of post-employment obligations note 24, derivative and other financial instruments notes 4b and 20, taxation note 6, provisions note 21 and impairment of non-current assets note 11.
Details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.
2 Segmental analysis The Groups reportable segments have been determined based on reports reviewed by the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive.
The operating activities of the Group are largely structured according to the markets served: aerospace, automotive and the land systems markets.
Automotive is managed according to product groups: driveline and powder metallurgy.
Reportable segments derive their sales from the manufacture of products and sale of service.
Revenue from inter segment trading and royalties is not significant.

Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given in the business review.
Significant judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

f Changes in UK tax rate A reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% took effect from April 2014 which gives rise to an effective rate of 21.5% for the year.
A further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015 has been substantively enacted.
UK temporary differences are measured at the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
g Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
The most recent High Court judgement in the case was published in December 2014.
Although the judgement was broadly positive, it is anticipated that HMRC will appeal at least some of the technical points decided.
GKN have historically received payments from HMRC in respect of the case, which have been recognised as received.
The continuing complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised and in particular which points HMRC may seek to appeal means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty.

c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
134 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Consistent with previous years all goodwill was tested for impairment.
An impairment charge of 69 million has been recorded in respect of 3 CGUs: 2 in Aerospace and 1 in Land Systems of 65 million and the carrying value of an investment balance of 4 million in Other Businesses.
An impairment charge in Engine Products East, North America Aerospace of 33 million follows a downturn in the market and loss of business during the year.
The charge only comprises goodwill.
The remaining recoverable amount of 59 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 12% 2013: 12%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 3 million.
An impairment charge in Special Products Europe Aerospace of 6 million follows a reduction in sales for a key product.
The remaining recoverable amount of 6 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 9% 2013: 11%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows but a 5% change in this assumption would not have impacted the impairment charge.
An impairment charge in Wheels and Structures Europe Land Systems of 26 million follows a significant downturn in the market during the year and loss of future orders.
The charge comprises goodwill of 18 million and property, plant and equipment of 8 million.
The remaining recoverable amount of 17 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 12% 2013: 13%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 2 million.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates One CGU within the Group, Power Management Devices Land Systems, has been assessed for impairment using an estimation of fair value less costs of disposal based on a multiple of EBITDA and recent comparable market prices.
Due to market conditions in the year value in use was not considered to be a representative assessment for impairment testing.
The relevant assets of Power Management Devices have been assessed against fair value less costs of disposal.
The assessment used an assumed EBITDA taking into account past performance, and a market based multiple following a review of comparable companies within a peer group.
Sensitivity analysis on this CGU is provided below.
All other CGUs recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of certain CGUs within the Groups Aerospace business, value in use was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGUs programmes.
In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
Ineach case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and civil programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of maintaining capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Aerospace: UK 9% 2013: 11%, Europe 8% 2013: 11% and North America 12% 2013: 12% Driveline: North and South America 14%-25% 2013: 13%-24%, Europe 9%-12% 2013: 12%-14% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 10%-20% 2013: 10%-19% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 10% 2013: 12% and North America 14% 2013: 13% Land Systems: Europe 9%-12% 2013: 11%-14% and North America 14% 2013: 13% GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 135 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Impairment testing continued Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: Aerospace: UK 3% 2013: 3%, Europe 2% 2013: 3% and North America 3% 2013: 3% Driveline: North and South America 3%-6% 2013: 3%-8%, Europe 2%-4% 2013: 2%-7% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-10% 2013: 2%-10% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 2% 2013: 4% and North America 3% 2013: 3% Land Systems: Europe 2%-4% 2013: 2%-4% and North America 3% 2013: 3% Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
At 31 December 2014, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of one CGU within the Groups Aerospace operations using value in use and one CGU within the Groups Land Systems operations using fair value less costs of disposal exceeded their carrying value by 199million and 23 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cashflow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

For other amounts, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2014.
Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
19 Financial risk management The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the effects of financial risk on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments include: forward foreign currency contracts, which are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business and cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge cash flows on the Groups debt.
Further information is provided in the treasury management section of the Strategic Report.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
On 3 September 2014 the Group entered a series of cross currency interest rate swap instruments with its relationship banks which in substance convert the 2019 and 2022 sterling bonds into US dollars $951 million and Euros 284 million.
These derivative instruments have been designated as net investment hedges of US dollar and Euro net assets.
The Groups reporting currency for its consolidated financial statements is sterling.
Changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of results and net assets of operations outside of the UK.
The Groups largest exposures are the Euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 1 million and 4million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact on operating profit: Trading profit: Payables Derivative and financial Intra-group receivables instruments funding m m m Euro 0.2 1.2 2.8 US dollar 0.5 22.9 2.0 The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant.
The sensitivity is a fair value change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occurred at 31 December 2014.
The Group intends to hold all such derivatives to maturity.
The analysis of other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
At 31 December 2014, 96% 2013: 96% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2014, 174 million 2013: 31 million was in bank deposits, 3 million of which was on deposit with banks on the Isle of Man 2013: 3 million.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Operational As tier-one suppliers to aerospace, automotive and land systems original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In Land Systems there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customers ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
At 31 December the largest 5 trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows: 2014 2013 % % Aerospace 74 69 Driveline 57 54 Powder Metallurgy 24 21 Land Systems 24 23 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 1,199 million 2013: 1,156 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long term credit rating, normally at least Aor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 35 million 2013: 28 million, however, the Group is not exposed to mark to market risk for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2014 as all counterparties were in a liability position 2013: 11million exposure to a single bank.

d Capital risk management The Group defines capital as total equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Groups two external banking covenants require an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more and net debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries of 3 times or less measured at 30 June and 31 December.
The ratios at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were as follows: 2014 2013 m m EBITDA 864 866 Net interest payable and receivable excluding borrowing costs capitalised 73 73 EBITDA to net interest payable and receivable ratio 11.8 times 11.9 times 2014 2013 m m Net debt 624 732 EBITDA 864 866 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.7 times 0.8 times The Group monitors these ratios on a rolling basis and they are part of the budgeting and forecasting processes.
e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities under a revolving credit facility total 800 million which expires in 2019.
There were no drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2014.
In addition the Groups European Investment Bank unsecured facility 80 million is repayable in five equal annual instalments of 16 million commencing in June 2015.
Committed facilities are provided through 14 banks.
The Group also maintains 98 million of uncommitted facilities, provided by 4 banks.
There were no drawings against these facilities at 31December 2014.

The maturity analysis for derivative financial instruments in 2014 includes cross currency interest rate swaps taken out in the year.
f Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial results.
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described in their relevant notes: Forward currency contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives, see note 20: Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash, short term bank deposits and other financial assets, see note 18: Fair value less costs of disposal for impairment testing of one CGU, see note 11: Bonds included within other borrowings, see note 18: and Fair values of trade receivables and payables, short term investments and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturity of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The discounted contingent element of deferred and contingent consideration of 6 million 2013: 6 million is categorised as a Level 3 fair value measurement, see note 17. h Hedge accounting The Group entered into a series of cross currency interest rate swaps during the year to better align its foreign currency income receipts in US dollars and Euros with its debt.
The cross currency interest rate swaps have been designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups US dollar and Euro net assets.
The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps at 31 December 2014 was a liability of 26 million 2013: nil.

After consideration of sensitivity analysis, amounts stated represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Contract provisions The Group has a small number of onerous contracts and a non-beneficial lease arrangement, primarily arising on business combinations and contractual dispute matters.
Onerous contracts relate to customer programmes where the unavoidable costs of delivering product are in excess of contracted sales prices.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 7 million in 2016 and 44 million from 2017.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 13 million in 2016 and 9 million from 2017.
Claims and litigation Claims provisions are held in the Groups captive insurance company and amount to 9 million 2013: 8million.

Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts of 3 million 2013: 5 million are provided.

In addition, in the USA and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits.
The Groups post-employment plans in the UK, USA and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 97% of plan liabilities.
The Groups post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements.
The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee administered funds.
The German and other European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets.
The USA includes a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, whilst Japan also operates a funded pension plan.
The Groups defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement.
In the UK and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the USA pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, whilst the USA schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2014.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit credit method.
a Defined benefit schemes significant judgements, assumptions and estimates Key assumptions: UK GKN1 GKN2 Americas Europe ROW % % % % % 2014 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service n a 4.05 4.10 n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.05 3.05 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service 3.25 3.55 3.80 3.90 1.90 0.80 Inflation assumption past future service 3.05 3.05 3.10 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long term 5.5 5.5 7.0 5.0 n a n a 2013 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a 4.30 n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.25 3.30 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate 4.20 4.50 4.80 3.50 1.25 Inflation assumption 3.25 3.30 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long term 5.5 5.5 7.5 5.0 n a n a The assumptions table above specifies separate assumptions for past and future service in relation to the UK pension scheme.
This represents a change in approach, whereby a different, future service set of assumptions will be used to determine the service cost for the following year.
There is no impact on the 2014 reported numbers as a result of this change.
This approach reflects evolving market practice and is based on the premise that active members of the scheme are younger and have, on average, longer remaining life expectancy than an average scheme member.
Given that yield curves typically rise over time, this longer duration implies a higher discount rate for the active sub-set of members which has been set at 3.80%, as at 31 December 2014.
The UK schemes each use a duration specific discount rate derived from the Mercer pension discount yield curve, which is based on corporate bonds with two or more AA-ratings.
The European discount rate was calculated with reference to Aon Hewitts German discount rate yield curve.
For the USA, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup intermediate pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate AA 10 years index and the Towers Watson Rate:LINK benchmark.
150 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, are as follows: United Kingdom The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN1 and GKN2 use S1NA year of birth mortality tables with CMI 2013 improvements and a 1.25% p. a. long term improvement trend.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN1 a male aged 65 lives for a further 21.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 23.8 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.5 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.7 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.1 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.6 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 27.1 years from age 65.
Overseas In the USA, RP-2014 tables have been used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used.
In the USA, the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 21.6 years female 23.8 years whilst in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.6 years female 22.8 years.
The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 23.2 years once attaining 65 years female 25.7 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.5 years female 25.5 years.
These assumptions are based on the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions longevity: 1 year on the defined benefit obligations as at 31 December 2014 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities m m m m Discount rate 1% 472 39 89 3 Discount rate -1% 601 48 115 2 Rate of inflation 1% 523 75 Rate of inflation -1% 408 63 Life expectancy 1 year 110 8 21 Life expectancy -1 year 109 8 19 Health cost trend 1% 2 2 Health cost trend -1% 2 1 The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in different assumptions.
In addition, these sensitivities relate only to potential movement in the defined benefit obligations.
The assets, including derivatives held by the schemes, have been designed to mitigate the impact of these movements to some extent, such that the movements in the defined benefit obligations shown above would, in practice be partly offset by movements in asset valuations.
However, the above sensitivities are shown to illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to key actuarial assumptions.
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and have not changed compared to the previous period.
Judgements and estimates USA Lump Sum settlements During 2014 the Group undertook a voluntary lump sum programme in the USA, whereby deferred members of its USA pension schemes were offered the no-obligation opportunity to exchange their future pension rights for a cash lump sum.
A settlement credit 8 million has been recognised in relation to this programme which is based on the differential between the actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes 32 million and the cash lump sum amounts 24 million.
The 8 million has been recorded within trading profit of Aerospace 3 million, Driveline 3 million and Powder Metallurgy 2 million.
Buy In During the year, a bulk annuity pensioner buy-in was transacted in relation to the UK pension scheme, GKN 1, as a result of which a proportion of GKN 1 liabilities are now fully insured.
The transaction involved a payment to Rothesay Life of 123 million, made from GKN 1s assets.
The bulk annuity covers 110 million of pensioner liabilities valued on an IAS 19 accounting basis, as at 31 December 2014.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 24 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes significant judgements, assumptions and estimates continued Pension partnership interest On 31 March 2010, the Group entered into a pension partnership arrangement with the Trustee of the UK pension scheme, which entitled the UK pension scheme to a distribution of 30 million per annum for 20 years, subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances.
The accounting and disclosure for this arrangement changed during 2013 following amendments to the pension partnership agreement which resulted in the income interest no longer meeting the criteria for recognition as an IAS 19 plan asset.
This increased the Groups reported post-employment obligation deficit by an amount of 342 million and eliminated the non-controlling interest of 332 million which was previously recognised in equity.
The remaining difference of 10 million was recognised in equity within retained earnings, as it represented a transaction with equity holders.
During the year the Group has paid 30 million 2013: combined amount of 30 million to the two UK pension schemes through the pension partnership and this is included within the amount of contributions benefits paid.
In 2013 10 million was paid before the partnership agreement was amended and was treated as a distribution from the pension partnership, whilst 20 million was treated as a contribution benefit paid.

Both UK pension schemes had a funding valuation as at 5 April 2013 and during the year final agreement on recovery plans with the scheme trustees was reached.
The Groups UK pension funding deficit is lower than the equivalent UK accounting deficit.
This has resulted in additional UK deficit recovery payments of 10 million per year which commenced in 2014 and the potential for further additional payments commencing in 2016, contingent upon asset performance.
In addition the Group also agreed, during the year, to pay 2 million per year for 4 years to UK scheme, GKN1, to cover a funding requirement arising from a 123 million bulk annuity purchase.
The combined contribution for deficit funding and future accrual expected to be paid by the Group during 2015 to the UK schemes is 47million.

c Defined benefit scheme risk factors Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The Groups focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than balance sheet volatility in its own right.
For funded schemes cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are performed on a different basis from accounting valuations.
Asset volatility: Plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields although the discount rate methodology differs for accounting and funding purposes.
If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase a plan deficit.
GKNs various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to out-perform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short term volatility.
As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of increased matching assets bonds and similar.
In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means of managing pension funding requirements, given the long term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility.
154 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Changes in bond yields: A decrease in bond yields will typically increase plan liabilities and vice-versa, although this will be offset partially by an increase in the value of bonds held in the asset portfolios of the various plans.
The effect of changes in bond yields is more pronounced in unfunded schemes where there is no potential for an offsetting movement in asset values.
Inflation risk: As UK and some European pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities, although caps are in place to protect against unusually high levels of inflation.
The UK asset portfolio includes some inflation linked bonds to provide an element of protection against this risk, whilst additional protection is provided by inflation derivatives.
Member longevity: As the Groups post-employment obligations are generally to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life expectancy will generally result in an increase in plan liabilities and vice versa.
d Defined benefit schemes demographic factors Weighted average duration is a measurement technique designed to represent the estimated average time to payment of all cash-flows arising as a result of defined benefit obligations i. e. pension payments and similar.
The weighted average duration years of the defined benefit obligations in the UK, USA and Germany are as follows: 2014 2013 UK GKN 1 11 11 GKN 2 17 17 USA 13 13 Germany 16 16 Defined benefit obligations are classified into those representing active members of a scheme or plan i. e. those who are currently employed by the Group, deferred members i. e. those who have accrued benefit entitlements, but who are no longer employed by the Group and are not yet drawing a pension and pensioner members who are currently in receipt of a pension.
Additional information regarding the average age, number of members and value of the defined benefit obligation in each of these categories for the UK, USA and Germany are given below: Active Deferred Pensioner Value Value Value Age Number m Age Number m Age Number m UK GKN 1 53 7,094 109 78 19,814 808 GKN 2 46 5,757 730 52 7,090 745 72 6,805 971 USA 53 2,685 110 56 1,396 39 74 4,417 168 Germany 51 2,571 247 56 883 44 71 2,966 252 Within the UK, there are two pension schemes referred to as GKN1 and GKN2.
GKN1 is a mature scheme, comprised primarily of pensioner members, which is already at peak annual cash outflow benefit payments : whilst GKN2 is less mature, with a larger active and deferred population.
Benefit payments from GKN2 are forecast to continue to rise until the mid 2030s, when they will peak, before beginning to decline.
