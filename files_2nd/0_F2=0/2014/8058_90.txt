Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently held at amortized cost, less provision for impairment.
If there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the full amount of the receivable, a provision is recognized on the balance sheet.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that a debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the present value of the related estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original interest rate.
