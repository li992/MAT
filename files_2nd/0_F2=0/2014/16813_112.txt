Under the terms of these bank facilities, lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to cancel their commitment 30 days from the date of notification of a change of control of the Company and have outstanding advances repaid on the last day of the current interest period.
The facility agreements provide for certain structural changes that do not affect the obligations of the Company to be specifically excluded from the definition of a change of control.
This is in addition to the rights of lenders to cancel their commitment if the Company has committed an event of default.
The terms and conditions of the drawn facilities in the Groups Italian, German, Turkish and Romanian operations 1,560 million in aggregate and the undrawn facilities in the Groups UK and Irish operations totalling 450 million are similar to those of the US dollar and euro revolving credit facilities.
Further information on these facilities can be found in note 22 Liquidity and capital resources.
Liquidity and capital resources This section includes an analysis of net debt, which we use to manage capital, and committed borrowing facilities.
Net debt Net debt was 13.7 billion at 31 March 2014 and includes liabilities for amounts payable under the domination agreement in relation to Kabel Deutschland 1.4 billion and deferred spectrum licence costs in India 1.5 billion.
This decreased by 11.7 billion in the year as the proceeds from the disposal of the US sub-group including our interest in Verizon Wireless, positive free cash flow and favourable foreign exchange movements more than offset the impact of the acquisition of Kabel Deutschland, payments for licences and spectrum, equity shareholder dividends, the return of value and share buybacks.
Net debt represented 23.5% of our market capitalisation at 31 March 2014 compared to 27.8% at 31 March 2013.
Average net debt at month end accounting dates over the 12 month period ended 31 March 2014 was 22.9 billion and ranged between net debt of 30.4 billion and a net surplus of funds of 2.7 billion.
