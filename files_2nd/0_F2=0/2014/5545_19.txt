Notes to the Accounts at 30 September 2014 1.
General information The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board on 17 November 2014.
Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in England.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Presentation of Financial Statements Statement of compliance These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Basis of preparation The financial information for the year ended 30 September 2014 has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 3 and are presented in pounds sterling.
Amounts are shown in millions, unless stated otherwise.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc and its subsidiaries.
Consolidated financial statements are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Result of the Parent Company The directors have taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish the Parent Company individual Income Statement and related notes.
Going concern The Groups business activities, including a description of its financial position, cash flows, debt and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Strategic Report on the inside front cover and then pages 02 to 25, along with a summary of factors likely to affect the Groups future development and performance.
Further details on the Groups financial instruments and risks can be found in note 24 of the accounts on pages 100 to 108.
The directors have made enquiries into the adequacy of the Parent Company and Groups financial resources, including a review of the budgets and medium-term financial plans, which includes a review of cash flow forecasts, financial covenant calculations and the ability to meet any refinancing requirements, and have a reasonable expectation that the Parent Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are explained further in notes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13.
New standards and interpretations adopted During the year the Group and the Parent Company have adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments: Amendment to IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements Clarification of the requirements for comparative information IAS 19: Employee Benefits revised Amendments to IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting Clarifying interim reporting and segment information for total assets Amendments to IAS 36: Impairment of Assets Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets 74 74 Ent Enter erpr prise Inns plc ise Inns plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts Accounts www www.

Presentation of Financial Statements continued IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement is applicable for the first time for the year ending 30 September 2014 and on a prospective basis only.
Under IFRS 13, the Group is required to assess the value of its licensed land and buildings on the basis of the highest and best use on which that asset could be realised, such a use being physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
For those assets held as part of the Groups on-going estate, the directors consider that the highest and best use basis of valuation continues to predominantly be as a public house principally due to the legal restrictions imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of use given those restrictions and the Groups business model.
When the necessary requirements have been met in respect of assets identified for disposal and revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the highest and best use for a market participant may reflect an alternative use for the asset.
The adoption of IFRS 13 has not had a material impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements of the Group however there are significant additional disclosure requirements.
For further information regarding the impact of adoption of this standard please see note 17.
The adoption of IAS 19 revised has not had a material impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements of the Group in the current or the prior year, but has resulted in minor changes to disclosures made in relation to the pension see note 29.
The adoption of the remaining standards outlined above has not had a material impact on the financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted As at 30 September 2014 there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations in issue some of which have not yet been adopted by the EU with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and which have not been early adopted by the Parent Company or Group.
Amendment to IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures Transition to IFRS 9 1 January 2015 IFRS 9: Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 Amendment to IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 1 January 2014 IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The standard should be applied in full for the year of adoption, including retrospective application to all contracts that were not yet complete at the beginning of that period.
Implementation of this standard may have an impact on the financial statements of the Group and Parent Company and an assessment of the impact of this standard is being carried out.
The Group and Parent Company are presently unable to quantify the potential impact until this assessment has been concluded.
The other new standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment.
On disposal of a pub, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been subsequently reversed.
Any such goodwill is not included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.

Accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company Balance Sheet are initially recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual impairment test.
Property, plant and equipment Licensed land and buildings, comprising of pub assets and non-pub assets, are held at their fair value and landlords fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost.
Pub refers to land and buildings held for operation either internally or externally as a licensed public house, excluding movable landlords fixtures and fittings.
Non-pub refers to land and buildings previously held as a pub but that are no longer trading as a licensed property and are instead leased for another use e. g. as a convenience store.
The Groups licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through Other Comprehensive Income to the revaluation reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.
Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through Other Comprehensive Income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset.
Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords fixtures and fittings and short life landlords fixtures and fittings.
Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The useful economic life of additions in the form of long life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 5 years.
Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight line basis to residual value.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment.
Where any indications are identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment.
Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the Balance Sheet as non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of transfer, and fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value less costs to sell is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds ERV which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
Licensed land and buildings and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for disposal by the Group.
They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be highly probable.
These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year.
Licensed land and buildings held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal.

Accounting policies continued Leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as operating leases are classified in the Balance Sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within non-current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
The Group enters into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been sold and the Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree.
These land and buildings have been classified as operating leases.
They are no longer included within property, plant and equipment and the rentals paid are charged on a straight line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments a Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand.
Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
b Borrowings Borrowings which include bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised cost.
This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument based on the estimated cash flows and the contractual terms of the agreement.
When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability.
If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment and written off through exceptional finance costs.
If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a modification any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the modified loan.
c Convertible financial instruments The gross proceeds received from the issue of a convertible bond are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing any embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instruments maturity date.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The difference between the interest expense calculated under the effective interest rate method and interest paid to bondholders is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bond.

Accounting policies continued d Equity instruments Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium.
e Trade receivables and trade payables Trade receivables and trade payables are held at amortised cost.
Fair value measurement The Group measures licensed land and buildings, within property, plant and equipment and non-current assets held for sale, at fair value and provides disclosure information in respect of the financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use provided that use was physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible to access.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
IFRS 13 requires that all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data.
Level 3 Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Net debt Net debt is the total book value of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables, trade payables and the equity component of the convertible bond less cash.
Underlying net debt is the nominal value of all financial assets and liabilities not including trade receivables and trade payables and the equity component of the convertible bond less cash.

Accounting policies continued Taxation The tax expense comprises both the tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be settled net or simultaneously.
Tax is charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income.
Similarly tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.
Otherwise tax is charged in the Income Statement.
Tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amount of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Pension obligations The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees own pension plans is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
As described in note 29, the Group has entered into a bulk annuity policy that is a qualifying insurance policy in respect of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme.
Prior to entering into the bulk annuity policy, in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme the amount recognised in the Balance Sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the schemes assets determined by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit.
The financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to both the scheme liabilities and plan assets, and is recognised within net finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income.
Settlements are recognised in the Income Statement in the period when the Group has committed to the settlement.
Having entered into the bulk annuity policy, the scheme liabilities continue to be valued on the projected unit credit method.
The value of the annuity policy is stated as equal to the amount ascribed to the plan liabilities covered by the policy.
Actuarial movements in the value of the schemes liabilities and the interest costs on scheme liabilities are matched by equivalent movements in the scheme asset.
To the extent that the Group is committed to deferred premiums or future administration costs in respect of the annuity policy or the scheme these are recorded as an additional liability within the pension deficit at the net present value of future premiums.
The unwind of the discount in this liability is charged as a finance cost.
The plan obligations will be derecognised on final settlement of the plan.
As discussed in the judgements on page 82, the difference between the cost of the bulk annuity policy and the related plan obligations is in effect part of a settlement process and is reported in the Income Statement within exceptional administration expenses.

Accounting policies continued Treasury shares The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of.
Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT.
Sales of beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our publicans.
Property rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable segment of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker CODM.
The Board reviews the Groups operations and financial position as a whole, reflecting the fact that non-pub income is not material to the Group, and therefore considers that it has only one reporting operating segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate operating solely within the UK.
The information presented to the CODM directly reflects that presented in the financial statements.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the award.
This value is subsequently updated at each Balance Sheet date for managements best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Parent Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement.
A corresponding entry is made to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading activities before net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of the pub estate and related assets, finance costs and taxation.

Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the Income Statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following: a Exceptional items recognised in operating profit Exceptional costs relating to regulatory matters, reorganisational costs and the charge for future settlement of the defined benefit pension scheme have been recognised in the administrative costs line.
b Net profit loss on sale of property, plant and equipment Net profit loss arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment less goodwill allocated to disposals.
c Movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income Statement.
If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised.
Where pubs identified for disposal are revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the revaluation movement is recognised on the same basis.
The remaining impact of the annual revaluation exercise or the identification of pubs for disposal is accounted for in Other Comprehensive Income.
d Net finance costs The gain or loss on purchase of own debt is calculated as the difference between the nominal price of the debt purchased less the aggregate of the consideration and related transaction costs paid.
The Group has elected to take the gain or loss on the settlement date.
Exceptional finance costs are recognised in relation to fees written off following the commitment to extinguish borrowings.
e Taxation A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the Balance Sheet relating to the pub estate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999.
This led to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax.
As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and changes in the rate of UK tax, a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement.
This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.
All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in the same performance statement as the gross item to which it relates.
The effect of changes in the enacted rate of tax used to calculate deferred tax is reflected in Other Comprehensive Income to the extent it relates to revaluation surpluses therein and in exceptional profit loss for all other elements of deferred tax.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income Statement.

Accounting policies continued Use of accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below: a Property, plant and equipment PPE Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors RICS and IFRS 13.
The valuation is based on an assessment of the income generating potential of the properties, and applying an appropriate multiple.
The highest and best use for the licensed land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally due to the legal restrictions imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial implications of a change of use given those restrictions and the Groups business model.
However, consideration is given to an alternative highest and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists which is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
Further information about the valuation of the pub estate is provided in note 17 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of PPE and these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year.
For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE.
b Testing goodwill for impairment The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired.
Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill to the group of Cash Generating Units CGUs that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level at which goodwill is monitored, on this basis goodwill is allocated to the entire estate.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 15. c Taxation Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a liability will arise.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
d Pension As explained in note 29, the Group has committed to a bulk annuity buyout of the defined benefit section of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan and commenced this process by purchasing a bulk annuity policy on deferred payment terms.
Following final payment, the intention is to purchase individual annuity polices.
As a result, all future obligations for the benefits included in the arrangement will ultimately be taken on directly by an insurer.
The cost of the bulk annuity policy is higher than the actuarial value of the obligations that it covers.
Management have used their judgement in deeming this process as being the settlement of the scheme and have recognised the difference between the cost of the bulk annuity policy and the actuarial value of the related plan obligations as a settlement charge in the Income Statement accordingly.
e Finance costs When borrowings are refinanced with substantially the same lender, the Group uses judgement when reviewing whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability.
As described in note 24 and note 35, subsequent to the year end on 7 October 2014 the Group has replaced its existing forward start facility with a new revolving credit facility.
In contrast to the forward start facility, the revolving credit facility is non-amortising, has reduced covenant tests, fewer restrictions and a significantly lower interest rate.
As the commercial features of the borrowings have fundamentally changed, the Group classified this as an extinguishment.
The principal impact of this judgement in the current year is a reassessment of the effective interest rate calculation in respect of the forward start facility such that previously unamortised debt issue costs of 2 million have been written off in the year through exceptional finance costs.

The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of 330 million as the fair value of the net assets acquired had been reduced.
As this pre-acquisition liability has reduced due to capital gains indexation relief and disposals, a credit has been recognised in the Income Statement.
The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2014 is 2 million 2013: 5 million.
This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based on earnings attributable to Ordinary Shareholders adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
For the year ended 30 September 2014, diluted earnings per share is based on the profit adjusted to remove the interest cost associated with the convertible loan note of 4.7 million 2013: nil divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year adjusted for dilutive ordinary shares relating to share options and the convertible loan note.
For the year ended 30 September 2013, any potential ordinary shares to be included when considering diluted earnings per share were anti-dilutive.
As a result there was no difference between basic earnings per share and basic diluted earnings per share, or between adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

Goodwill 2014 2013 m m At 1 October 345 359 Allocated to disposals 7 14 At 30 September 338 345 Allocation to disposals In accordance with IAS 36 goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained.
Impairment testing Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment.
For this purpose, the goodwill is allocated to the pub estate being a group of Cash Generating Units CGUs, as this represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount.
The recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flow over a three year period, as prepared for the Board.
The three year cash flows continue to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook.
They include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic conditions and have also been adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals.
The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required to support trading.
Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable.
Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate in operating income 2013: 2% which was selected as prudently below the Groups estimate of the long-term average growth rate.
The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is managements focus on selecting and supporting the best publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.
The forecast cash flows are then discounted to give a value in use.
The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital WACC, which has been risk adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows.
In making this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the year end date.
The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer group data.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2014 was 8.0% 2013: 8.0%.
As at 30 September 2014, the headroom on the impairment test is 555 million, the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 8.86% before any impairment would be required.
Management have considered the volatility in the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and the growth rate of any cash flows beyond the budget period would need to fall by 0.98% before any impairment would be required.
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

Property, plant and equipment continued Fair value measurement of property, plant and equipment In determining the appropriate classes of asset to present for fair value purposes, the company has considered the nature, characteristics and risks of the assets.
This has resulted in determining two separate classes of assets, pub and non-pub as described in note 3.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment Valuations are carried out on an annual basis at each year end date.
With the exception of properties identified for disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, the Groups pub and non-pub assets were revalued as at 30 September 2014 by GVA Grimley Limited or Christie & Co. independent Chartered Surveyors, or by the internal Asset and Valuation Director, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
For further analysis of the pubs valued by valuer see table on page 96.
All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market observable inputs.
The pub assets were valued using fair maintainable trade income FMT capitalised at an appropriate rate of return as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards Red Book or an equivalent multiple.
This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future trading potential.
This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate multiple to reflect the risks and rewards of the property.
In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market transactions.
The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlords fixtures and fittings.
The non-pub assets, which are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores, are let to the operators at open market rents.
These assets have been valued adopting the investment method of valuation.
By reference to the rents fixed, lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.
Both classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use.
IFRS 13 prescribes that the Groups current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.
In doing their valuations, the valuers consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value where applicable.
This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a higher and better use.
In the current year the highest and best use of all the pub assets in property, plant and equipment has been assessed as their existing use.
The table below presents, by class of property, the income and multiple bandings within which the properties have been valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings.
In determining the bandings to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property, but has concluded that the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most appropriate disclosure.

Property, plant and equipment continued Sensitivity analysis table The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of the Groups estate are FMT and a multiple.
There is a limited amount of interrelation between the variation in these inputs.
A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate.
Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the valuers are illustrated below: Group FMT Multiple Sensitivity level 2.5% 2.5% 0.25 0.25 m m m m Pub assets and non-pub assets 95 95 99 99 Company FMT Multiple Sensitivity level 2.5% 2.5% 0.25 0.25 m m m m Pub assets and non-pub assets 49 49 50 50 No comparative information has been presented under IFRS 13 in accordance with the guidance included in IFRS 13 for initial application.
The pubs used as security for the corporate bonds in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by GVA Grimley Limited 2,026 pubs and a representative sample of pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited Unique has been valued by Christie & Co 200 pubs.
GVA Grimley valued a further sample of pubs in Enterprise Inns plc 79 pubs.
The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc 460 pubs and the rest of the Unique estate 2,263 pubs have been valued by the internal Asset and Valuation Director using RICS valuation guidelines.
The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers.

The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances.
The Groups objective is to minimise this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate.
The amount of trade and other receivables included in the Balance Sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the Balance Sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2014 the value of collateral in the Group is 32 million 2013: 32 million and in the Parent Company is 21 million 2013: 21 million.
This balance is held on the Balance Sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by publicans.

The maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

Current tax payable continued During the year an enquiry by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC in relation to a discounted convertible loan note issued in the accounting period ended 30 September 2004 has been formally resolved and closed.
The closure of this enquiry resulted in a settlement agreement with HMRC of 9 million plus interest, which will be paid in instalments over a two year period.
3 million has been paid during the year.
The final instalment will fall due to be paid in January 2016 and therefore 2 million of the current tax payable is being shown as a non-current liability.
This has been fully provided for in the accounts since the inception of the loan note.

Fair values The corporate bonds and securitised bonds were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers.
The fair value of the corporate bonds and securitised bonds is measured at market price and are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3.
Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The fair value value of the Groups bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the discounted cash flow method using discount rate that reflects the issuers borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period.
The own non-performance risk as at 30 September 2014 was also assessed to be insignificant.
Cash balances, in the current year and in the prior year, within the Group include 65 million held within a securitised Reserve Account.
Withdrawals can only be made from this account with the consent of the securitised Trustee.
The nominal value of financial assets and liabilities is the principal amount.

The bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are held at amortised cost.
Finance lease payables represent the present value of future minimum lease payments.
Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables.
However there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.
Bank borrowings The forward start facility comprised of a tranche B of 66 million and a tranche C of 75 million which were due to expire in June 2016, tranche A having been cancelled in September 2013.
Tranche B was a term loan with tranche C being a revolving facility.
The margin over LIBOR payable under tranche B and C was 4.5% and 4.0% respectively.
The margin over LIBOR payable on the tranche C loan was due to be reduced to 3.5% following repayment of the B facility.
A utilisation fee of 0.5% was payable if tranche C was more than 66% drawn.
On 7 October 2014 a new 138 million non-amortising revolving credit facility was agreed, which is available through to September 2018 which replaced the forward start facility.
This has extended the maturity compared to the current forward start facility and also benefits from improved terms, simplified covenants and lower pricing with a new interest rate of 3% over LIBOR.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Corporate bonds On 3 February 2014, the Group repaid upon maturity a 60 million corporate bond from available cash flow.
On 10 September 2013 Enterprise Funding Limited the Issuer issued a 97 million 3.5% guaranteed convertible bond due 2020 the bond at par.
The Parent Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations including payments in respect of the bond.
The obligations of the Parent Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.
Subject to the terms, the bond is convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company.
The bond converts at a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141.5p, which means that the bond is convertible based on an exchange share price of 191.0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares.
The exchange share price is adjusted on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial 75 million recorded as a liability and 22 million recorded within equity, stated net of costs of 2 million and 1 million respectively.
The difference between the effective interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds.
On 7 October 2014 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the secured bond - issued 3 March 2003 due for repayment in 2018 600 million 2018 corporate bonds.
The partial refinancing will result in a lower interest cost and an extended debt maturity.
Prior to the refinancing 600 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%.
The Group received and accepted tender instructions for 249.5 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 108.75% of their principal amount.
In connection with this partial refinancing the Group issued new 249.5 million secured corporate bonds due in October 2023 at a coupon of 6.0%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds due in 2018 to 350.5 million.
The new issue benefits from a security package on substantially the same terms as the original 600 million 2018 corporate bonds.
Securitised bonds During the year the Group has made scheduled repayments of the Unique A3 and A4 securitised bonds, which together with 10 million of bonds purchased and cancelled, leaves 1,221 million outstanding at the year end.
At 30 September 2014 the Group was 79 million ahead of the amortisation schedule through early repayment and market purchases.
Intercompany The amount owed to subsidiary undertakings relates to the issue of the convertible bonds in Enterprise Funding Limited, these proceeds have been on-loaned to Enterprise Inns plc on the same terms with an amount recorded in equity and an amount recorded as a liability.
Financial instruments and risk The Groups financial instruments comprise bank borrowings, corporate bonds, securitised bonds and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised as follows: Ent Enter erpr prise Inns plc ise Inns plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts Accounts 103 103 ffor the y or the year ended 30 Sept ear ended 30 September 2014 ember 2014 23605.04 9 December 2014 9:48 AM Proof 8 Shar Shareholder Inf eholder information ormation Accounts Directors Report Strategic Report Notes to the Accounts at 30 September 2014 24.
Financial assets and liabilities continued Liquidity risk The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds.
This objective is achieved through the following processes: regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function: regular review of the Groups debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile: and maintenance of undrawn bank facilities.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Interest rate risk The Group borrows its corporate bonds and securitised bonds at a fixed rate.
Bank borrowings and cash balances attract interest at a floating rate.
The Groups objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates on the majority of its debt.
At 30 September 2014, the Groups borrowings were 97% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.3% for 8 years 2013: 97% fixed at an average rate of 6.3% for 8 years.
The Parent Companys borrowings were 93% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 8 years 2013: 94% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 8 years.
Interest rate sensitivity In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest rates.
The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, and further developments in global financial markets.
As such the below should not be considered as a projection of likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.

There are four covenants that relate to the bank borrowings, which are tested quarterly.
There are two leverage covenants and two asset valuation covenants.
There is sufficient headroom on all four of these covenants.
The new revolving credit facility benefits from simplified covenants and does not reflect one of the leverage covenants.
There are two covenants that relate to the corporate bonds excluding the unsecured convertible bond : an asset value covenant and a net annual income covenant.
At the year end there is an annual valuation of the pub estate and a review of the annual income for the pubs secured under each of the corporate bonds.
The valuation is undertaken by a firm of independent chartered surveyors.
The directors certify the net annual income as part of an annual compliance exercise.
In the event that pub values or pub incomes have fallen, there may be a requirement to add more pubs to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new pubs must be completed within 90 days of the year end.
There is sufficient headroom in both of these covenants.
There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end.
These covenants are based solely on the assets held within the securitised bonds and comprise a net asset covenant and a debt service cover covenant.
The Group tests all of the above covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting process.
These are reviewed at Board level.

The 6 million was repaid to HMRC in April 2014 and the provision held for this amount since its receipt in 2010 was therefore utilised.
HMRC originally paid this amount to the Group on the condition it would be returned if they were successful in an appeal in respect of the Rank Group plc gaming machine litigation.
The decision on the matter being considered by the Court of Appeal was recently announced and found to be in favour of HMRC and accordingly allowed them to recover monies paid to the Group in 2010.
There is a separate, but connected, matter which was considered by the European Court of Justice and has now been referred back to the UK First Tier Tribunal for a decision, which could also have a bearing on whether this amount is ultimately repayable to the Group, or retained by HMRC.
Rank Group plc has also been allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal decision which found in favour of HMRC.
Therefore litigation is likely to continue on both strands of this case.
The non-current provision in both the Group and Parent Company relates to future commitments under onerous lease agreements.
The provision is expected to be utilised over the life of leases involved or as the pubs are disposed of.
The remaining lease terms vary from 0 to 57 years.
Deferred tax The deferred tax in the Balance Sheet relates to the following: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Unrealised surplus on revaluation of fixed assets and rolled over gains 191 210 85 90 Accelerated capital allowances 57 58 38 39 Share-based payments 2 3 2 3 Temporary differences 9 1 2 6 237 264 119 132 The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax by 2% from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and has previously announced its intention to reduce the rate by an additional 1% to 20% by 1 April 2015.
The changes in corporation tax to 20% have been substantively enacted and therefore the effects of these reductions have been included in the calculation of deferred tax in these financial statements.

Deferred tax continued The deferred tax provision for the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets in the Group has moved during the year as follows: m Opening provision at 1 October 2013 210 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to indexation credited to the Income Statement 2 Reduction in deferred tax liability due to movements from revaluation of pub estate and disposals recognised in the Income Statement 10 Reduction in deferred tax liability recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 7 Closing provision at 30 September 2014 191 The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and receivable within the Group.
Pension The Group and the Parent Company make defined contribution payments to employees own pension plans and these payments are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group reorganisation established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999.
The plan has defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The plan is governed by the employment laws of the United Kingdom which require final salary payments to be adjusted for the consumer price index upon payment during retirement.
The level of benefits provided depends on a members length of service and salary at retirement age.
The fund has a legal form of foundation and is governed by the Board of Pension Trustees.
The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy.
In April 2014, the Trustees of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan the Plan and the Company committed to a bulk annuity buyout of the defined benefit section of the Plan, crystallising a liability of 10 million payable through a deferred payment schedule over the next four years.
The initial stage of this process has now been completed and involved the Trustees using the Plans defined benefit section assets to purchase a bulk annuity policy from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited LGAS.
The policies commenced with effect from 30 April 2014 and will be held for the time being as investments of the Plan.
Once the deferred premiums have been paid, the Trustees intend to ask LGAS to issue individual annuity policies to defined benefit section members and then wind-up the Plan, after which the Company will no longer retain any responsibilities or obligations to the members of the Plan.
As a result of the above arrangements, a provision for a settlement charge of 10 million has been recorded within exceptional administration costs.
The Income Statement charge also includes an estimate of ongoing administration costs to be incurred by the plan in the period to final settlement.
In view of the relative insignificance of the pension scheme, both on a gross and net basis, the Group has elected to only present summarised disclosures to one decimal place in respect of the scheme.

The number of shares granted in 2013 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2013.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are released in the forfeited released line.

The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes model.
The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation Model.

The 2013 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2014.
The Deferred Share Award for the executive directors vests in four years, the Deferred Share Award for the executive management vests in two equal tranches after 2 and 3 years and the Deferred Share Award for the other members of the senior team vests after 3 years.
The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after three, four and five years.
Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of the option.
For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met.
This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP.
These conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR element of the scheme.
