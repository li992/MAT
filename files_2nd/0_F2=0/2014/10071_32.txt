Melrose Industries PLC 152 Annual Report 2014 Financials Notes to the Company Balance Sheet 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the current and prior year.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Directors statement of going concern on page 49 of the Finance Directors review.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration paid.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: Share-based payment.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Directors best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are made available to employees of the Companys subsidiaries, these are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding increase in the Companys investment in subsidiaries.
Cash Flow Statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 revised : Cash flow statements because it prepares a consolidated Cash Flow Statement which is shown on page 104 of the Group financial statements.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
