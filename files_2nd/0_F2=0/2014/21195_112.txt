Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 694 million 2013: 777 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.

In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 434 million 2013: 438 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2014 2013: nil.
