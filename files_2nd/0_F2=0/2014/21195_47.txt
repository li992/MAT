Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests audited information Executive directors share ownership requirements The Company requires the Group CEO to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of basic salary and each ED to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 150% of basic salary.
From 2015, subject to shareholder approval, the Group CEO will be required to build a stake equivalent to 300% of salary.
The EDs are required to retain 50% of the net shares released from deferred annual bonuses and LTIPs until the shareholding requirement is met.
Shareholding requirements will need to be built up over a five year period.
Unvested share awards including shares held in connection with bonus deferrals are not taken into account in applying this test.

This has also prevented him from being able to purchase shares.
