b The actuarial losses or gains arising from experience adjustments on the defined benefit liabilities represent the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed, or actual benefit increases being higher than the long-term inflation assumption.
c The actuarial losses or gains arising from experience adjustments on plan assets represent the difference between actual investment performance in the year and the expected rate of return on assets assumed at the start of the year.
