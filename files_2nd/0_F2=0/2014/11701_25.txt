Financial statements Financial statements Notes Notes 1 Basis of preparation and business environment The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements: Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention asmodified by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Groups Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Companys Financial Statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted bySection 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
The result of the Company for the year is shown in Note 25.
Financial year end The current years Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the previous years Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Going concern The Group has borrowing facilities in place until January 2019.
At 31 December 2014 these are in the form of a $310 million term loan, which issubject to repayment through instalments every six months plus a final payment, and a $150 million revolving credit facility.
These facilities aresubject to financial performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Group has prepared a financial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short-term and medium-term plans.
The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management and revenue reduction, and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have adequate working capital available to continue inoperational existence for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings Note 13 drawn up to 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power to affect those returns.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation.
Investments insubsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the Financial Statements of the Company.
Functional and presentational currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment inwhich the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
The US Dollar Pound Sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2014 was 1.56 2013: 1.64.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty The Groups main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 57 to 63.
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Groups accounting policies in many areas.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are asfollows: Warranty provisions Pace provides product warranties for its products.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility ofan epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the field.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 57 Financial statements Notes Notes Continued 1 Basis of preparation and business environment continued Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty continued Royalty provisions Paces products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence.
Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights.
Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed.
Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
Provisions for royalty claims are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle a claim that has resulted from the sale of a product allegedly using technology of a patent owner, and the amount of the outflow can be reliably measured.
The directors have made provision for the potential royalty payable based on the latest information available, which represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation.
Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are finally settled.
Impairment reviews As is required by International Accounting Standards, the Group carries out impairment reviews of its non-financial assets on an annual basis, orwhen indicators of impairment exist.
Such reviews involve assessing the value in use of an asset or cash-generating unit CGU by reference toits estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value.
The judgements in relation to impairment reviews relate to the assumptions applied in calculating thevalue in use, and the future performance expectations.
Intangible assets Capitalised Development Costs The Group business includes a significant element of research and development activity.
Under accounting standards, principally IAS 38 IntangibleAssets, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benefits from projects deemed to be commercially viable.
The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management of the forecasted economic benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life ofthe associated revenues from the product.
Acquisition Accounting As part of the accounting for business combinations it is necessary to perform a purchase price allocation exercise to identify appropriate categories of intangible assets that have been purchased.
Such an exercise involves judgement with regard to the types of assets identified, the value of those assets and the useful economic lives applied with regard to amortisation rates.
The amounts recognised are calculated by reference to management forecasts and assumed discount rates, obsolescence curves and attrition rates.
For significant acquisitions, whilst the Directors use appropriate qualified independent valuation advisors to assist in the purchase price allocation work, the exercise inherently requires significant judgement and estimation to be taken.
2 Accounting policies Business combinations Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power to affect those returns.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group.
Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination.
If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from apast event and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
Transaction costs thatthe Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional andconsulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
58 Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill continued Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill isincluded in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, thatforms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 date of transition to Adopted IFRS hasbeen frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review atthecash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation andaccumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset categories asfollows: Customer contracts and relationships three to ten years Technology and patents one to ten years Other three years Research and development expenditure All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sales are intended, a market exists and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from commercial launch.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between six and thirty months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Companys distributable profits asthecosts meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the income statement within theAdministrative expenses category.
Impairment charges The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU.
Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Any impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed ateach reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 59 Financial statements Notes Notes Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Exceptional items Items that are significant by virtue of their size or nature and that are considered non-recurring are classified as exceptional operating items.
Suchitems which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructuring and profits and losses made on the disposal of properties, are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category, albeit analysed as a separate line within that category, and are highlighted separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive of value added taxand net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the customer and substantially all of the Groups work is completed, which is usually upon delivery to the customer or his her agent.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is inherently judgemental.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken and any future obligations remaining.
Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses recognised on financial assets.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Government grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement oragainst the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the projects related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Allowance for doubtful debts Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
60 Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Long leasehold properties Period of lease Short leasehold properties Period of lease Plant and machinery One to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over theperiod of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The directors have determined that the instruments qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income costs.
If a hedge ofaforecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 61 Financial statements Notes Notes Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able tocollect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Taxes Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment.
The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expenses in profit or loss.
Employee share ownership plans The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benefits Trust are treated as being those of the Company.
Until such time as the Companys own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at equity.
Employee benefits Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event anditisprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
a Royalty provision Provisions for royalty claims are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle aclaim that has resulted from the sale of a product allegedly using technology of a patent owner, and the amount of the outflow can be reliably measured.
62 Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Provisions continued b Warranty provision A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data andaweighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product byproduct basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
c Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
d Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Contingent Liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence ofone or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that anoutflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
A contingent liability also arises in where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably.
The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a New and amended standards adopted by the Group The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments for the first time.

Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 63 Financial statements Notes Notes Continued 3 Segmental analysis In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the chief operating decision-maker CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors which reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance of the business and make decisions.
The Group determines operating segments on the basis of SBU areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.
During the period the Group created a new SBU named Pace Networks, which contains the Aurora Networks Inc business acquired in 2014.
Inaddition, certain other activities were restructured and split out across the Pace International and Pace Americas SBUs.
The Group has the following operating segments which are also reportable segments for the purpose of IFRS 8: R Pace Americas: R Pace International: and R Pace Networks.
Other amounts include unallocated central costs that are not classified as reportable segments under IFRS 8.
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is reviewed by the CODM.
Adjusted EBITA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments, relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There are no material inter-segment transactions.
The tables below present the segmental information on the revised basis, with prior periods amended to conform to the current period presentation.

The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is calculated using the treasury stock method which accounts for the fact that not all options are wholly dilutive.
Further details of the outstanding share options held at the end of the year can be found in Note 27.
To better reflect underlying performance, adjusted earnings per share is also calculated adjusting profit after tax to remove amortisation of other intangibles and exceptional items, post-tax.

Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 69 Financial statements Notes Notes Continued 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill continued The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across Strategic Business Units, which are groups of cash-generating units CGUs as follows: R $138.7 million within Pace International 2013: $153.1 million : R $190.7 million within Pace Americas 2013: $189.5 million : and R $141.7 million within Pace Networks 2013: n a.
These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on the following years budget and the Groups three year plan.
These forecasts have been approved by the Board, and have an appropriate long-term growth rate of 1% 2013: 1% applied to them.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 10.4% 2013: 13.4%.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Sales growth, selling prices and direct costs are built up within the budget and three year plan on a product by product basis utilising the knowledge and expertise of operational staff.
The anticipated launch dates for new products, the achievable prices and direct costs tobe incurred are therefore highly judgemental.
The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
The directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered the following reasonable changes in the assumptions: R movements in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%: and R reductions in cash flows of up to $10 million per annum.
The directors consider that there is sufficient headroom within the value in use calculations at 31 December 2014.

e Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: Carrying Contractual 6 months 612 12 23 34 45 amount cash flows or less months years years years years $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m At 31 December 2014: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 934.6 934.6 934.6 External borrowings 275.2 279.0 19.4 19.4 46.5 54.2 62.0 77.5 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outflow 98.4 90.5 7.9 Inflow 4.4 102.8 95.0 7.8 Total 1,214.2 1,209.2 949.5 19.5 46.5 54.2 62.0 77.5 At 31 December 2013: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 567.1 567.1 567.1 External borrowings Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outflow 145.1 95.2 49.9 Inflow 0.5 145.4 96.0 49.4 Total 567.6 566.8 566.3 0.5 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.
The Directors have considered the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur, together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
f Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
The directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve month period would have a $2.6 million impact on cash flows 2013: $Nil.
The Groups key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling.
A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against these would have an adverse impact of $Nil 2013: $1.0 million on the profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2014 and an adverse impact of $0.6m 2013:$5.8 million on equity.

Other provisions Other provisions mainly relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within the Group, along with professional fees to be incurred inrelation to the Aurora acquisition and certain other provisions.
Warranty provisions Pace provides warranties for its products from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost of repair information and aweighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must becalculated at the outset of product shipment before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the productin the field.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.

Prior to the acquisition the Group had no interest in the acquiree, and an explanation of the rationale for the acquisition is set out in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
In the period from the acquisition date to 31 December 2014, Aurora Networks Inc contributed revenue of $264.6 million and adjusted EBITA of$47.4 million.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014, the consolidated results would not be materially different.

33 Contingencies Currently there are claims against the Group in which it is asserted that certain of the Groups products infringe third party patents.
Claims for which a probable cash outflow has been determined have been provided based on the Directors best estimate note 20.
Within the claims portfolio, there are claims for which it is believed that the probability of a cash outflow is remote.
The Directors believe that a cash outflow in relation to the remaining claims is more than remote but not probable.
This element of the portfolio includes claims where the counter-party has not submitted a monetary claim for damages, claims that have only recently been received and claims that have not provided the Group with sufficient information to determine if Pace products are involved.
As a result, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate the financial impact on the Group.
Any claim received by the Group is subject to thorough scrutiny.
