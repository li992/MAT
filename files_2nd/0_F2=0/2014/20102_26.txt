Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation Basis of accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for items that are required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements set out on pages 78 to 123 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies, except for the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations noted below.
No revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2014 had a significant impact on the Group Financial Statements.
These Financial Statements are presented in millions of Sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 38 to 41.
In addition, Note 26 to the Financial Statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups net debt balance at 31 December 2014 was 125.6m 2013: 104.1m, with available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 316.8m 2013: 311.0m.
The Board has reviewed sensitivity analysis on the Groups forecasts to 30 June 2016, the maturity profile of its financial facilities and liabilities Notes 16 and 27 and the ability of the Group to refinance these obligations as they fall due.
The principal liquidity and solvency risk is mitigated through its financial risk management policies Note 26.
For the foreseeable future, the Board has a high level of confidence that the Group will have the necessary liquid resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and will be able to sustain its business model, strategy and operations and remain solvent, including the impact of reasonable scenarios.
For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group Financial Statements.
There are no key sensitivities identified in relation to this conclusion.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted There are a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2014 and have, therefore, not been applied in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective from the 31 December 2017 year end.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the results or Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets and amortisation The cost of acquiring software including associated implementation costs where applicable that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset.
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation.
These criteria include demonstration of the technical feasibility and intent of completing a new intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
From the point where expenditure meets the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives.
The Directors consider that, due to the nature of projects undertaken, the proportion of development costs incurred that meets the criteria for capitalisation is immaterial.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination that are separable from goodwill are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Other acquired intangible assets including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost plus any associated implementation costs where applicable.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administration expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life determined on an asset by asset basis or underlying contractual life.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years.
Patents, contractual rights and technology up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contractual right.
Customer-related and trade names 3 to 20 years, dependent upon the underlying contractual arrangements and specific circumstances such as customer retention experience.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost comprises the purchase price paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful economic life.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are ready for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
The depreciation charge is revised where useful lives are different from those previously estimated, or where technically obsolete assets are required to be written down.
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate lives, they are accounted for and depreciated as separate items.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold property 20 to 40 years.
Short leasehold property over the period of the lease.
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell.
Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis or, in some cases, a weighted average basis is used if deemed more appropriate for the business.
Provisions are made to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete items to net realisable value, based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of historic and projected usage with regard to quantities on hand.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value, less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows receivable.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management have made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Information about significant areas of judgements, estimates and assumptions is included in the following notes: Note 11 Impairment of goodwill.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been tested for impairment by estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which it has been allocated.
Note 11 outlines the significant assumptions made in performing the impairment tests: Note 13 Provisions against inventory.
Judgement is applied to assess the level of provisions required to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory to their net realisable value: Note 14 Provisions for impairment of trade receivables.
Judgement is applied to assess whether a trade receivable is recoverable or not, and whether the level of provision required to write down the value of the receivable to its recoverable amount is appropriate: Notes 18 and 28 Provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to determining the risk-adjusted probability, quantum and timing of managements best estimate of future payments: Note 19 Defined benefit pension obligations.
The defined benefit pension obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, including future inflation, salary increases and mortality, and the obligation is then discounted to its present value using an assumed discount rate.
The pension deficit has been calculated using the assumptions set out in Note 19: Note 20 Deferred tax.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income in the relevant countries concerned: and Note 24 Business combinations in relation to the estimation of the provisional fair values and useful lives of acquired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
b Summary of significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by Group entities to all years presented in these Financial Statements.
Business combinations and goodwill The Group applies IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations for transactions arising after 1 January 2010.
This changed the Groups definition of the cost of business combinations and the treatment of contingent consideration.
The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration depends on whether this was initially recognised as equity or as a liability and whether the event is considered a measurement period adjustment.
Transaction costs on a business combination are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Income Statement.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings over the net fair value to the Group of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised, and any impairment losses are not subsequently reversed.
The net book value of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS has been treated as deemed cost.
On the subsequent disposal or discontinuance of a previously acquired business, the relevant goodwill is dealt with in the Consolidated Income Statement except for the goodwill already charged to reserves.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates and comparing it against the net book value.
This estimate of recoverable amount is determined at each statement of financial position date.
The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the reportable operating segments in Note 3.
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business outlook for the cash-generating unit, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the obligation.
In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and their corresponding tax bases.
No provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits by overseas subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised or that they will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are charged credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the income statement items of subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange.
Statement of financial position items are translated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to the translation reserve within equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they arise.
On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, any cumulative exchange movements relating to that subsidiary held in the translation reserve are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the Groups exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The accounting policies applied in these circumstances are described below.
Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 86 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Financial instruments Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
Loans and receivables comprise loans and advances other than purchased loans.
Originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished.
Originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or Group of financial assets, is impaired.
A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or Group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Net investment hedge accounting The Group uses US Dollar and Euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies, caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, the changes in the value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 87 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits The Group operates defined benefit post-retirement benefit schemes and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan as the present value of schemes liabilities less the fair value of schemes assets.
The operating and financing costs of defined benefit schemes are recognised separately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, scheme administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on net asset deficit.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in schemes liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined contribution scheme A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
In certain countries, the Group participates in industry-wide defined benefit-type pension arrangements.
In such circumstances, it is not possible to determine the amount of any surplus or deficit attributable to the Group and the pension costs are accounted for as if the arrangements were defined contribution schemes.
These are not material to the Group and, accordingly, no additional disclosures are provided.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Groups operating companies with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-settled options.
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date if sooner.
Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired own shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Revenues Revenues comprise sales to external customers after discounts and excluding Value Added Tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, which is typically on delivery.
For contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of services rendered as at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
This is assessed by reference to the amount of time incurred in proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver the service.
Occasionally, the initial contract covers both the supply of goods and ongoing support, servicing and maintenance.
For such contracts revenue is allocated across each of the individual components in line with their relative value and each element is accounted for as described above.
Interest payable and receivable Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method.
Interest receivable comprises interest income on cash and funds invested and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues.

Adjusted performance measures Spectris plc uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures enable them to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management have defined as amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 8.
In addition, all comparative income statement and operating cash flow figures have been restated to exclude the trading results and impact of the disposal of the Fusion UV business which was disposed of on 31 January 2013.
The adjusted performance measures are derived from the reported figures under adopted IFRS as follows: 2014 2013 Sales m m Sales as reported under adopted IFRS 1,173.7 1,202.0 Divested businesses 4.2 Sales excluding divested businesses 1,173.7 1,197.8 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2014 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Sales by segment Note m m m m m Sales as reported under adopted IFRS 3 348.8 342.9 261.4 220.6 1,173.7 Materials Test and In-line Industrial 2013 Analysis Measurement Instrumentation Controls Total Sales by segment Note m m m m m Sales as reported under adopted IFRS 362.4 348.7 269.9 221.0 1,202.0 Divested businesses 4.2 4.2 Sales excluding divested businesses 3 362.4 348.7 265.7 221.0 1,197.8 The following is an analysis of revenue by geographical destination: 2014 2013 m m UK 44.4 39.9 Germany 116.7 125.4 France 39.9 46.3 Rest of Europe 171.5 177.8 USA 344.2 336.9 Rest of North America 37.5 36.3 Japan 59.4 61.3 China 153.7 159.5 South Korea 33.6 33.7 Rest of Asia Pacific 96.6 100.9 Rest of the world 76.2 79.8 1,173.7 1,197.8 2014 2013 Adjusted operating profit Note m m Operating profit as reported under adopted IFRS 168.3 185.9 Net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments 3.9 0.7 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets 11 25.9 28.9 Adjusted operating profit 198.1 215.5 Divested businesses 0.8 Adjusted operating profit excluding divested businesses 198.1 214.7 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 89 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 2.

The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the four reportable segments, being the 13 operating companies.
Bolt-on acquisitions are quickly integrated into existing Group companies and are therefore not considered separately.
The most significant elements of goodwill are as follows: 2014 2013 Pre-tax Pre-tax Goodwill discount rate Goodwill discount rate m % m % Omega Engineering 170.1 13.4 160.1 14.4 PANalytical 92.7 12.0 94.2 12.7 Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 65.0 11.9 67.9 12.6 HBM 64.9 12.4 65.3 13.0 BTG 50.6 11.8 52.7 12.4 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 99 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 1.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued As part of the annual impairment review, the carrying amount of goodwill for all businesses excluding Engineering Seismology Group ESG see below has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity, reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year as approved by the Board, and strategic review projections for 2016 and 2017.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next three years, projected long-term growth rates beyond 2017 and the discount rates applied.
The forecast cash flows include managements latest estimates on sales volumes and pricing, production and other costs.
There are no individually significant business level cash flow assumptions in respect of any business that materially impact the impairment testing.
The key judgements are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
Growth rates for the years beyond 2017 are assumed to be 4.0% 2013: 4.0%, based on the lowest operating profit growth experience by any cash-generating unit over the past ten years.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using cash-generating unit specific pre-tax discount rates between 11% and 15% 2013: 12% and 16%.
These rates have been determined by taking the size of business and specific geographic and industry risk factors into account.
The reduction in the discount rates compared to the prior year is primarily due to a reduction in the risk-free rate.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge was recognised in either 2014 or 2013.
The Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for these businesses that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge.
For illustration, the Directors have considered the following specific individual sensitivities: a two percentage point pp increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit would result in an impairment of nil 2013: nil : if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced by 2.5pp to 1.5% 2013: reduced by 2.5pp to 1.5%, no impairment would arise 2013: nil : and if the cash flow projections of all cash-generating units were reduced by 25% for the next two years, no impairment would arise 2013: nil.
For ESG acquired on 10 December 2014, given the proximity to the year end, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to the value in use based on the acquisition business plan that assumed long-term growth rates in line with that anticipated for the rest of the Group, and certain post-acquisition synergies associated with being part of a wider Group with shared support functions.
Given the assumptions built into the ESG acquisition business case, the Directors do not consider that there is a significant risk of impairment of the ESG acquisition goodwill arising in the next 12 months.
Other intangible assets The Directors consider that operating results in 2014 confirm that none of the Groups brought forward trading businesses has suffered a permanent diminution in value as a result of the current economic environment.
Of the total amortisation charge of 29.4m 2013: 32.4m, the amount attributable to the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets was 25.9m 2013: 28.9m.
The transfers from property, plant and equipment to software in 2013 relate to identifiable software assets.
The Group has no internally-generated intangible assets from development expenditure as the criteria for the recognition as an asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets have not been met 2013: nil.
The trade names and technology assets recognised on the acquisition of Omega Engineering in 2011, and included within the Industrial Controls reportable segment, are considered significant by the Directors as they represent 48.0% 2013: 58.1% of total customer-related and trade names, and 25.0% 2013: 30.1% of total patents, contractual rights and technology, respectively.
The carrying amount of the trade name intangible at 31 December 2014 is 52.2m 2013: 53.1m and is being amortised over 20 years with the remaining amortisation period being 16.8 years.
The carrying amount of the technology intangible at 31 December 2014 is 19.4m 2013: 21.0m and is being amortised over ten years with the remaining amortisation period being 6.8 years.

Trade receivables and other receivables are stated after the recognition of provisions for impairment of 5.5m 2013: 3.6m and the reversal of previously recognised provisions for impairment of 5.0m 2013: 5.0m.

All trade receivables past due for more than 120 days have been fully provided for in line with the Groups credit risk policy.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to its carrying amount due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business.
Costs are expected to be incurred within one year and there is little judgement in determining the amount.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, but can extend to 36 months.
These extended warranties are not significant.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising from trade.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the most likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
The reduction in the provision during the year is due to a lower legal risk profile in the Group.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these provisions are shown as current.
No provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and, therefore, the possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
Retirement benefit schemes Spectris plc operates funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK.
In addition, 12 overseas subsidiaries 2013: 11 overseas subsidiaries in three overseas countries provide defined benefit plans.
Other UK and overseas subsidiaries have their own defined contribution plans invested in independent funds.
Defined benefit plans The UK, German, Dutch and Swiss plans provide pensions in retirement, death and in some cases disability benefits to members.
The pension benefit is linked to members final salary at retirement and their service life.
Since 31 December 2009, the UK plan has been closed to new members.
The UK plan is administered by a pension fund, but the overseas plans are held by several insurance companies that are legally separated from the Group.
The UK plan is managed by a Board of Trustees that represents both employees and employer, who are required to act in the best interest of the plans participants and are responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the various funds.
The UK plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk, but the risk of the overseas plans is limited as the benefits have been reinsured with various insurance companies.
Inflation and interest rate hedges are taken out to mitigate against risks arising on the UK plan.
Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 104 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 9.
Retirement benefit schemes continued The overseas plans are funded by the Groups overseas subsidiaries, and the UK plan has been funded in the past by both the Groups UK subsidiaries and the Company.
The investments of the UK plan are invested in accordance with Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Although the Act permits 5% of the plans assets to be invested in employer-related investments, the Trustees have elected that none of the plan assets are to be invested directly in Spectris plc shares.
The funding requirements are based on the individual funds actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the various plans.
Employees are not required to contribute to the plans and the German plan is unfunded.
The Group has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, and in accordance with statutory requirements including minimum funding requirements of the plans of the respective jurisdictions, the present value of the refunds or reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total present value of obligations.
This determination has been made on a plan-by-plan basis.
As such, no decrease in the defined benefit asset was necessary at 31 December 2014 and December 2013.
The last full actuarial valuation for the UK plan was 31 December 2011 and an updated valuation is being done at 31 December 2014: for the German and Swiss plans it was 31 December 2013 and for the Dutch plans it was 31 December 2012.
Where applicable, the valuations were updated to 31 December 2014 for IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits purposes by qualified independent actuaries.
The total Company contributions made to the defined benefit plans during the year ended 31 December 2014 were 1.5m 2013: 1.5m.
Contributions for 2015 are expected to be 0.6m for the German plan and 1.0m for the Swiss plan.
The above contribution rates are subject to review at future valuations and periodic certifications of the schedule of contributions.
Contributions to the Spectris Pension Plan UK ceased from 1 July 2012.

It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK.
However, 42.4m 2013: 29.6m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 2.3m 2013: 1.6m, of which only 0.4m 2013: 0.3m has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

Share capital and reserves continued Other reserves Movements in reserves are set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the Company and treated as treasury shares see Note 22.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Groups own shares.
Treasury shares At 31 December 2014, the Group held 6,054,835 treasury shares 2013: 6,344,254.
During the year 289,419 of these shares were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the Groups share schemes 2013: 1,268,125.
No shares were repurchased by the Group during the year 2013: nil and no shares were cancelled during the year 2013: nil.
Share-based payments The Save As You Earn Share SAYE Option Scheme was set up in order to provide executives and selected employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company.
Under the SAYE Option Scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the SAYE Option Scheme.
Under the Performance Share Plan unapproved share options as defined by HMRC, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the Companys shares.
From 2014, awards to Spectris plc executives are subject to performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on fulfillment of an adjusted earnings growth EPS target, 33.3% of the award subject to a total shareholder return TSR target and 33.33% of the award being based on fulfillment of an economic profit target.
Awards to Spectris plc executives in the years up to 2013 are subject to performance criteria: 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of an EPS target and 50% of the award subject to a TSR target.
Awards to Spectris plc senior managers are still subject to this performance criteria.
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the Groups operating companies in 2008 and 2009 have performance criteria subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award.
For awards made subsequent to 2009, the performance criteria is EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award.
Operating company manager awards up to 2013 were entirely subject to operating company profit targets and vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting.
Except in respect of two Group operating companies, where performance criteria continue to apply, operating company manager awards made in 2014, under the Restricted Shares Plan, have no performance criteria.
Since 2011, Performance Share Plan options have also been granted to UK employees that are approved share options as defined by HMRC.
The performance criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the unapproved options granted described above.
The approved share options are linked to the unapproved share options in order to benefit from the tax-exempt status of approved share option grants to a value not exceeding 30,000.
Should there be a gain on exercise under the approved options, such gain will cause a proportionate reduction in the number and value of the linked unapproved options.
Should there be no gain on exercise under the approved options, these options are then forfeited and the linked unapproved options may be exercised in full, to the extent their performance criteria is met.

Share-based payments continued From 2014, operating company manager awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan.
Awards vest three years from grant and are cash-settled on vesting.
The Restricted Shares Plan is subject to the same rules as the Performance Share Plan but gives flexibility as to whether or not awards are subject to performance criteria.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
The central treasury department operates as a service centre to the Group and not as a profit centre.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The quantitative analysis of financial risk is included in Note 27.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, Danish Krone, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its foreign currency exposures using derivative financial instruments.
The Group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge highly probable transactions which can be forecast to occur typically up to 18 months into the future.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Income Statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Income Statement of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the Groups foreign currency subsidiaries.
The quantitative analysis of foreign currency risk is included in Note 27.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups interest rate profile.
As at 31 December 2014, the majority of the Groups borrowings attract fixed rates of interest linked to LIBOR and therefore the Groups principal interest rate risk is a fair value risk.
The quantitative analysis of interest rate risk is included in Note 27.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk through the use of regularly updated cash flow and covenant compliance forecasts and a liquidity headroom analysis which is used to determine funding requirements.
Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high quality investment grade lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 December 2014 are set out in Note 16.
Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 118 Strategic Report 0141 Governance 4274 Financial Statements 75131 Notes to the Accounts continued 26.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
The quantitative analysis of credit risk to receivables is included in Note 14. Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed centrally by transacting with existing relationship banks with strong investment grade ratings.
Accordingly, the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, as shown in Note 27.
Capital management The Board considers equity shareholders funds, together with committed debt facilities, as capital for the purposes of funding the Groups operations.
Total managed capital at 31 December is: 2014 2013 m m Equity shareholders funds 916.0 844.1 Committed debt facilities Note 16 474.7 456.7 1,390.7 1,300.8 Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
This is carried out through a Save As You Earn option scheme in the UK, as well as performance share plans.
Full details of these schemes are given in Note 23.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings, the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the benefits of an implied investment grade credit rating.
The main financial covenants in the Companys debt facilities are the ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the ratio of finance charges to adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
Covenant testing is completed twice a year based on the half-year and year-end Financial Statements.
At 31 December 2014, the Company had, and is expected to continue to have, significant headroom under these financial covenant ratios.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The fair value of the contingent consideration liability of 12.2m has been determined by discounting the expected payments to their present value based on forecast sales using risk-adjusted discount rates specific to the acquisition.
The significant unobservable inputs are the level of forecast sales and the risk-adjusted discount rate.
The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales were higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower.
There were no movements between the fair value hierarchy in the year.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings are estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and the cross-currency interest rate swaps are determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2014 is a net liability of 0.3m 2013: net asset of 3.6m, of which 0.3m has been debited to the hedging reserve 2013: 2.9m credit and nil credited to the Consolidated Income Statement 2013: 0.7m credit.
These contracts mature over periods typically not exceeding 18 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.
In accordance with IFRS, all of the cash flow hedges in 2014 and 2013 were deemed to be effective.
