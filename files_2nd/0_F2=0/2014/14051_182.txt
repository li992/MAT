Contract provisions relate to provisions for loss making onerous contracts.
The present value of the estimated future cash outflows required to settle the contract obligations as they fall due over the respective contracts has been used in determining the provision.
The individual provisions are discounted where the impact is assessed to be material.
Following a downturn in performance for certain contracts and the strategy review currently being undertaken, a full analysis was performed of the future profitability of all contracts with marginal performances and of the balance sheet items directly linked to these contracts.
There remains a level of uncertainty over the amount and timing of the related cash flows as a result of the matters set out in note 3.
Due to the significant size of the balance, if the expected operational performance varies from the best estimates made at the year end, a material change in estimate may be required.
The key drivers behind operational performance is the level of activity required to be serviced, which is often directed by the actions of the UK Government, and the efficiency of Group employees and resources.
The Contract and Balance Sheet Review also highlighted the need for additional provisions where parts of the business are no longer considered to be core.
This resulted in an increase in various other provisions, as explained below.
Further details relating to Onerous Contract Provisions are described in the Finance Review section of the Strategic Report under the heading Onerous Contract Provisions and Related Impairments including all sections up to, but not including, Onerous Contract Provisions Projected Utilisation.
Employee related provisions are for long-term service awards and terminal gratuities liabilities which have been accrued and are based on contractual entitlement, together with an estimate of the probabilities that employees will stay until retirement and receive all relevant amounts.
There are also amounts included in relation to restructuring.
Property provisions relate to leased properties which are either underutilised or vacant and where the unavoidable costs associated with the lease exceed the economic benefits expected to be generated in the future.
The provision has been calculated based on the discounted cash outflows required to settle the lease obligations as they fall due.
Other provisions are held for legal and other costs that the Group expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
