OPERATING SEGMENTS The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is the Board of Directors.
Internal management reports are reviewed by the CODM.
Key measures used to evaluate segment performance are revenue and segment contribution to EBITDA.
Management believes that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions as central costsare not allocated across the segments.
The CODM considers the Groups segments to be its three channels to market, being retail including online, wholesale and other.
Retail revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to end consumers via JimmyChoo directly operated stores in Europe, USA, Hong Kong, China and Japan and via the Groups website.
Wholesale revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to distribution partners, multi-brand department stores and speciality storesworldwide.
Other revenue is predominantly generated through receipt of royalties from the Groups global licensees of JimmyChoo branded fragrance, sunglasses and eyewear products.
There are no material inter-segment transactions.

JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CON TINUED ALLOCATION OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS The carrying value of goodwill is allocated as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Retail 187,856 187,565 Wholesale 114,172 114,172 Other 4,650 2,863 306,678 304,600 Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
Goodwill of 294.2m arising on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is allocated to the groups of cash generating units acquired that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
This is consistent with the determination of operating segments.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the value-in-use of each operating segment is calculated as described below.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of J. Choo Hong Kong JV Limited, the business line of JimmyChoo in Shanghai Kutu Trading Co. Ltd. and J. Choo Russia JV Limited described in note 13 is allocated to the retail segment for impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Studio Luxury S. r. l. on 5 August 2014 described in note 13 is allocated to the other segment for impairment testing.
The JimmyChoo brand, which was valued at 263.8m on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is considered to have an indefinite useful life and accordingly is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or where an indicator of impairment is identified.
The brand is fundamental to the operations of the Group as a whole and is therefore not allocated to cash-generating units but tested for impairment at the Group level.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING The value-in-use is represented by the discounted value of future cash flows that are expected from continuous use of the assets associated with the cash generating units and by the terminal value attributable to them.
In assessing the value-in-use, the cash flow projections were taken from the Groups five year business plan, approved by the Board of Directors.
The cash flow projections are subject to key assumptions in respect of discount rates, future net revenue, margin and EBITDA growth.
The directors have reviewed and approved the assumptions inherent in the model as part of the annual budget process using historical experience and considering economic and business risks facing the Group.
The terminal value was determined using a perpetuity long-term growth rate in line with macro-economic estimates of 3%.
In assessing the Groups value-in-use a discount rate of 9.9% 2013: 11.3% has been applied to the groups of cash generating units.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations by assuming a reasonable change in the discount rate, revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and terminal growth rates.
The sensitivity analysis indicated significant headroom between the recoverable amount under these scenarios and the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill or the brand in any of the years presented as, for each cash generating unit and the Group as a whole, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS During the year the Group operated two equity-settled share based compensation schemes and one cash-settled share based payment scheme for its Directors and employees.
Details of each of these schemes are set out in this note.
CASH-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEME PHANTOM OPTION SCHEME The Group operated a long term incentive plan open to invited employees of the Group the Participants, which was accounted for as acash-settled share based payment scheme.
The Participants in the scheme were required to purchase equity in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group the Subsidiary in order to receive matching phantom options over the shares of theSubsidiary.
A put and call agreement existed between the Participants and the Subsidiary which enabled the Participant to put their equity shares back tothe Subsidiary at fair value.
The Subsidiary could call the shares in the event of a change in control or if the Participant left employment with the Group.
The put and call agreement was accounted for as a cash settled share based payment scheme as the Participants were required to remain employed by the Group in order to participate in any increase in the fair value of the underlying equity shares.
The IPO of the Group in October 2014 triggered the vesting conditions of the all the options.
Of these, 5,387,877 options were exercised at afair value of 1.40, calculated with reference to the IPO price.
The remaining 3,571,713 were cancelled and replaced by the equity-settled JC PLC Scheme detailed below.
At IPO the Participants also exchanged their shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited for shares in JimmyChoo PLC via a series of share-forshare exchanges.
The put and call agreement over the Participants shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited lapsed at IPO.
The liability of 3.5m that had previously been recognised in respect of the put and call agreement was therefore reclassified to equity.
The total liability recognised in respect of the cash settled share based payment scheme at 31 December 2014 was nil 2013: 5.9m.
Details of the movements during the year are as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted average Number of average Number of exercise share options exercise price share options price Outstanding at the beginning of the year 8,959,590 1.00 4,679,620 1.00 Granted during the year 1.00 6,000,000 1.00 Cancelled during the year 3,571,713 1.00 1,720,030 1.00 Exercised during the year 5,387,877 Expired during the year Outstanding at the end of the year 8,959,590 Exercisable at the end of the year There were no phantom options outstanding at 31 December 2014.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Directors have overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business has been developed.
A register of strategic and operational risk is maintained and reviewed by the Directors, who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from wholesale customers and the Groups foreign exchange forward contracts.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different customers.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group only sells to wholesale customers who are creditworthy and mitigates risk in certain markets by trading on terms with accelerated payments, bank guarantees and letters of credit, as well as adopting credit insurance when appropriate.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties using publicly available information.
As a result the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 17.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative instruments.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to thecarrying value of these instruments if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation.
The Groups policy isthat surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties, who are either party to the Groups banking syndicate, or who are credit worthy counterparties.
LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the Groups cash requirements.
The risk is measured by review of forecast liquidity each month to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements and by monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no expected significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Cash flow forecasts are submitted monthly to the Directors.
These continue to demonstrate the strong cash generating ability of the business and its ability to operate within existing agreed banking facilities.
There have been no breaches of covenants during thereported years.
For further details of the Groups borrowings see note 18.
All short-term trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less.
The carrying value of all financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Groups non-current financial liabilities, excluding derivatives used for hedging, is as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 In more than one year, but not more than two years 12,299 470,914 In more than two years, but not more than three years 5,862 8,021 In more than three years, but not more than four years 116,408 6,268 In more than four years, but not more than five years 6,115 125,225 In more than five years 6,195 Total non-current financial liabilities 146,879 610,428 MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income.
The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest and currency risk.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations mainly with regard to the interest expense on the debt carried by Choo Luxury Finance Limited.
The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to EURIBOR LIBOR plus a margin.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants and business plan.
The Group has historically held interest rate swaps in connection with the financing put in place at the time of the acquisition of the Group byJAB Luxury GmbH.
The original swap agreements expired in 2014.
Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a change in interest rates of 1% is included below.
JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CON TINUED FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group operates internationally and is, therefore, exposed to the foreign exchange risk which can negatively impact revenue, costs, margins and profit.
The Group transacts with its suppliers of finished goods, based in continental Europe, in euro.
In addition to this, the Group is exposed to transaction risk on the translation and conversion of surplus US dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan balances, generated by its directly owned stores globally into euro and pounds sterling.
The Groups policy allows these exposures to be hedged for up to 12months forward in order to create sufficient certainty to price different collections and assure the business cash flows.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts and nil cost options.
These contracts are put in place as part of the Groups treasury management strategy.
It enables merchandisers to be given targeted exchange rates for products, which are set aligned with the hedge rates for future collections, typically 912 months before cash flows crystallise.
In addition, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign currency gains and losses arising on the Euro denominated portion of its external bank facilities.
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date in currencies other than the local currency of operation.
Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and other amounts to be received orpaid in cash.
Amounts exclude intercompany balances which eliminate on consolidation.

CAPITAL RISK The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to optimise returns to its shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain future growth.
The Directors regularly monitor the Groups level of capital to ensure that this can be achieved.
Cash is used to fund the Groups continued investment and growth of the global brand.
It is also used to make routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax and dividends.
The Group has access to a revolving cash flow facility of 91.6m 71.6m of which 14.9m 11.7m was utilised at 31 December 2014 2013: 25.1m available 20.1m and nil utilised nil.
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout the reported years.
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values.
The majority of the financial assets are current.
The majority of the current interest-bearing liabilities are at variable interest rate.
The fair values of the non-current fixed rate interest-bearing liabilities are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
The fair value of non-current fixed rate interest-bearing liabilities is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cashflows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The fair value of derivative instruments currency forwards and options is determined based on current and available market data.
Pricing models commonly used in the market are used, taking into account relevant parameters such as forward rates, spot rates, discount rates, yield curves and volatility.
JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 112 23.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CON TINUED FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised into the below levels, reflecting the significance of the inputs used in estimating thefair values: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical instruments: Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly from market data: Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs, this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
The Group recognises derivative financial instruments at fair value.
No other financial instruments are carried at fair value.
The derivative financial instruments have been measured using a level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 12,045 20,334 Trade and other receivables 41,087 35,520 Other financial assets 1,450 Total financial assets 53,132 57,304 Trade and other payables 99,659 90,192 Borrowings 137,586 602,728 Other non-current liabilities note 20 15,374 Other financial liabilities 2,903 419 Total financial liabilities 255,522 693,339 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on its earnings.
