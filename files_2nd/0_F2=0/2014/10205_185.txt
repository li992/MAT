Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2014 continued 34 Restatement of comparative figures for the years ended 30 April 2012 and 30 April 2013 On 29 October 2013, Group management was made aware by our Country General Manager in India of a claim by a partner in India that in July 2012 the partner entered into a transaction with what the partner believed to be a genuine customer introduced to them by a Micro Focus sales representative for the sale of Micro Focus software.
The partners invoice for the sale had been due to be settled in December 2012 but as at 29 October 2013 was still outstanding.
Micro Focus had no record of the end user transaction nor of the involvement of the partner in the transaction and the Country General Manager was not contacted by the partner until October 2013.
Group management immediately appointed KPMG, the Groups Internal Auditors, to conduct an investigation into all sales in India within the current and the preceding two financial years and suspended the Micro Focus sales representative whilst the investigation took place.
The investigation revealed further transactions initiated by the sales representative for which Micro Focus had received payment either directly or indirectly from the partner network in India for which no end user contract existed.
The total amount of revenue impacted by the actions of the sales representative was $3.1m and covered a period dating back to October 2011.
$2.5m relates to periods prior to 30 April 2013 and $0.6m impacts the current period.
Micro Focus had received cash payments for $2.5m of these transactions.
The current period Adjusted EBITDA is adversely impacted by $1.5m being the $0.6m of revenue and $0.9m of costs.
Considering the current year revenue guidance provided by Micro Focus to the market, the cumulative impact on the current period revenue of reversing the misstatement would have had a material qualitative impact on the relative revenue performance.
Consequently, the directors have decided to restate the prior period reported and CCY revenues to reflect the period in which the original transactions took place.
The effect is to reduce bank loan costs and increase the inflow from trade and other receivables 30 April 2013: $2,021,000.
The consolidated statement of changes in equity has been restated for the year ended 30 April 2013 to correct an error in the classification of equity reserves between the share premium account and retained earnings as previously reported of $2,560,000.
The restatement for the impact of the misstatement of revenue caused by invalid orders within our sales channel network in India of $2,006,000 and the reclassification within equity reserves of $2,560,000 gives rise to a total restatement in equity reserves of $554,000.
