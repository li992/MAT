Pensions risk arises in respect of the defined benefit scheme where the cost of funding retirement benefits ultimately falls upon the Group.
The last triennial actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2013 showed a funding deficit on the defined benefit scheme of 47.4m.
The Group has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of c9.4m per annum until May 2019.
In addition it contributes 1.9m per annum towards the cost of insured death benefits and other administrative expenses of running the scheme.
The Group seeks to manage the cash flow impact arising from pensions risk.
Accordingly, the defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002 and was restricted as to future accrual from April 2011.
The Group attempts to further manage its exposure by agreeing with the Pension Scheme Trustees the assumptions to be used to calculate the scheme liabilities, the investment strategy to be followed and any cash contributions to be made by the Group.
