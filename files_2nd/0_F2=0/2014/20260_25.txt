The effective tax charge borne by the Company and its UK subsidiaries will reduce accordingly in future years.
All UK deferred tax assets and liabilities that will unwind in the future have been recognised at an average rate of 20%, which has been calculated based on the future rates which will apply at the estimated dates of unwinding.

104 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude amortisation of intangible assets and acquisition-related items.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of these non-cash or one-off items.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators that the carrying value may be impaired.
Definite life intangibles are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
If any indication exists, further assessment is made of whether the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement requiring assessment as to whether i there is an impairment indicator and, if so, ii the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.
There are a number of assumptions to determine the estimated recoverable amount.
These include the selection of market growth rates, discount rates, assets under management flow assumptions, expected revenue growth and operating costs.
Further detail on these assumptions is shown below.
com 107 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use five year cash flow projections based on the Groups approved budget for the year to 30 September 2015.
A long term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows within the value-in-use calculations beyond the initial five year projections.
The long term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long term nature of the Groups business and in line with the Boards view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
The other principal assumptions in the forecasts are: 2014 2013 % % Annual increase in assets under management 5.0 6.0 Annual increase in operating costs 4.0 5.5 The assumed annual increases in operating costs include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate to estimate a market rate relevant to the sector and associated risks.
2014 2014 2013 2013 Post tax Pre tax Post tax Pre tax % % % % Discount rate 9.94 11.53 9.75 11.40 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The assumptions are derived from past experience and consideration of current market inputs.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis and without the effect of that change on other variables, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the value-in-use to the carrying value of goodwill were as follows: 2014 2013 % % Discount rate pre tax 26.5 30.8 Revenue growth rate 5.9 5.7 Operating cost growth rate 25.5 28.0 The value-in-use, calculated in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value-in-use of 4,307 million 2013: 4,242 million over the carrying value of these assets and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
108 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Management contracts and distribution agreements The Group reviewed the management contracts and distribution agreements held at 30 September 2014 including 79.3 million 2013: 79.3 million of management contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These indefinite life assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
Impairment tests were performed using either value-in-use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill or estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as considered appropriate, and the measures of value compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2014 30 September 2013 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life m period years years m period years years Definite life management contracts 537.1 1-8 4-10 232.9 1-7 2-10 Definite life distribution contracts 3.0 1 5 12.1 1-3 5 Indefinite life open end fund contracts 79.3 N A Indefinite 79.3 N A Indefinite 619.4 324.3 The definite life management contracts include those acquired in the current year as part of the SWIP acquisition, which have a net book value of 355.2 million at 30 September 2014, together with the contracts acquired from Credit Suisse in 2009 which have a net book value of 100.1 million 2013: 121.3 million.
Intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives.
This shall not exceed the period of the contractual rights but may be shorter depending on the period over which the entity expects to use the asset.
There is a judgement in assessing these lives including assessment of client retention.
We have typically assessed these to be between 5 and 10 years - looking at each acquisition on a case by case basis.
Factors considered include size of book of business, market and growth prospects and nature of investments managed under the contracts.
Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as the Group review described above.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
At 30 September 2014, the Company held indefinite life open end fund contracts with a value of 3.4 million 2013: 3.4 million.
com 109 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Acquisitions Acquisitions 2014 a.
"The Group completed the purchase from Lloyds Banking Group ""Lloyds"" of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Group Limited SWIP and its related private equity businesses on 31 March 2014 and the purchase of SWIPs infrastructure fund management business was completed on 1 May 2014."
Total consideration for the transaction was 606.6 million, comprising three elements: i 131.8 million new ordinary Aberdeen shares issued at an average price of 392.7p: ii a deferred top-up payment of 38.3 million payable on 31 March 2015: and iii contingent deferred consideration of up to 100 million under an earn-out agreement with Lloyds.
The fair value attributed to the earn-out payment at completion was 50.7 million.
108.5 million new shares were issued on 31 March 2014 at a share price of 390.3p and a further 5.95 million shares were issued on 1 May 2014 at a price of 443.4p.
The remaining 17.3 million shares will be issued on 3 December 2014, Lloyds having now received its necessary regulatory consents.
This element of consideration has been recognised in equity as a deferred share issue 67.6 million.
Total equity consideration recognised was 517.6 million.
The deferred top-up payment of 38.3 million was determined as the difference between the weighted average share price for the 5 days before the acquisition date and a floor price of 420p, the difference multiplied by the number of consideration shares.
The Group is entitled, at its sole option, to settle this item in cash or by the issue of further shares and, accordingly this payment has been recognised as a current liability.
The contingent deferred consideration of up to 100 million is payable in cash and the actual amount payable will be determined according to the growth over the five year period to 31 March 2019 of recurring revenue generated from the strategic relationship with Lloyds.
The fair value at completion of 50.7 million was determined based on a probability weighted expected return analysis of cash flow assumptions and calculated by reference to the expected performance and growth over 5 years, discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 39.1 million to 100 million.
After unwinding discount of 3.2 million, the deferred liability is 53.9 million at 30 September 2014.
The acquisition of the SWIP businesses adds scale to the business across a range of asset classes, strengthens investment capabilities and adds new distribution channels in addition to the strategic relationship with Lloyds.
The acquired business added approximately 60 million of net tangible assets to the combined business, intangible assets of 394.5 million and goodwill of 227.6 million arose on completion of an independent valuation see below.
In the six month period to 30 September 2014, SWIP contributed revenue of 119.8 million and profit before tax of 59.8 million.
However, if the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2013, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by a further 120.0 million, and consolidated profit before taxation for the period would have been increased by a further 60.0 million.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2013.
Acquisition and integration related costs of 37.7 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition costs.
Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets acquired in both transactions.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table on the following page.
Goodwill is mainly attributable to the skills of the workforce acquired and the synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Finalisation of the independent valuation following the SWIP acquisition did not result in any material adjustments to the provisional fair value disclosed for the 6 months to 31 March 2014.
The valuation of intangibles and the determination of useful economic lives determined at the point of acquisitions are significant accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are valued based on forecast income streams from the management contracts.
This includes assumptions on client attrition and markets.
Valuation of the earn out and recognition over the 5 year term are also significant accounting estimates.
This is discussed further in note 29.
The determination of useful economic lives is discussed in note 13.
110 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements The fair value of the intangible assets has been based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts, with the exception of 7 million internally developed software which is based on managements best estimate of replacement cost.

On 21 May 2013, the Group completed the purchase of Artio Global Investors Inc. Artio, a US listed asset manager, for a purchase consideration of 109.8 million $166.5 million.
The acquisition of Artio added scale to our existing US fixed income business and has complemented our organic efforts to expand distribution in the US.
In the four months to 30 September 2013, Artio contributed revenue of 8.5 million and profit before taxation of 4.1 million: if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2012, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by 24.2 million, and consolidated profit before taxation for the year to 30 September 2013 would have been increased by 11.0 million.
This takes into account the post acquisition results.
"On 31 May 2013, the Group acquired 50.1% of the issued share capital of SVG Managers ""SVG"", a fund of private equity specialist, for a cash consideration of 17.5 million plus the contribution of the Groups existing fund of private equity business."
This business was combined with Aberdeens existing private equity capability to create a substantial private equity fund of funds business with around 5 billion of assets under management.
The Group has a call option to acquire, and SVG Capital plc a put option to sell, the remaining 49.9% stake at any time from the third anniversary of completion, at a price based on a valuation of the business at the time the option is exercised, subject to a minimum of 20 million and a maximum of 35 million.
As the exercise of the put option is outside the control of the Group, the option has been recognised as an other liability measured at fair value and the remaining 49.9% has been recorded as a non controlling interest.
The fair value of the written put option has been recognised at 30.5 million 2013: 27.5 million.
This value is determined based on the expected payment of 35 million and calculated by discounting the expected future liability at a market related discount rate, expected future performance and assuming the option will be exercised after the remaining two years.
Unwinding of the discount of 3.0 million is recognised in equity.
SVG contributed 9.0 million revenue and 0.7 million to the Groups profit before taxation for the period between the date of acquisition and 30 September 2013.
If the acquisition of SVG had occurred on 1 October 2012, we estimate that consolidated revenues for the period would have been increased by 25.0 million and consolidated profit before taxation would have been 8.9 million for the year to 30 September 2013.
c. Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table below.

When such circumstances arise, the Board considers the likelihood of a material outflow of economic resources and provides for its best estimate of costs where an outflow of economic resources is considered probable.
By their nature, provisions often reflect significant levels of judgement or estimate.
While there can be no assurances, the directors believe, based on information currently available to them, that the likelihood of other material outflows is remote.

Where investments are not listed, fair value is determined in accordance with independent professional valuers or International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines where relevant.
The fair value of unlisted investments in infrastructure funds is based on the phase of individual projects forming the overall investment and discounted cash flow techniques based on project earnings.
126 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame and are carried at the amount due to be settled.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
"Fair value of the written put option As described in note 14, the Group has the option to acquire, and SVG Capital plc the option to sell, the remaining 49.9% stake in Aberdeen SVG Private Equity Managers Ltd ""Aberdeen SVG""."
The option is exercisable by either party at any time after the third anniversary of the transaction, except where shareholders are unable to resolve a significant disagreement known as a 'deadlock'.
In the event of a deadlock, either party can exercise the option at any time.
The fair value of the written put option has been calculated by discounting the expected future liability based on managements best estimate of the cost of the option being exercised after three years and at a discount rate based on the Groups cost of capital.
Recognised within other liabilities, this represents the fair value of the consideration payable for the remaining 49.9% stake in Aberdeen SVG.
Changes in fair value and the unwind of the discount is recorded in equity see note 24.
Fair value of deferred consideration As described in note 14, the Group has recognised a fixed liability for a deferred top up payment of 38.3 million in connection with the SWIP acquisition to be settled in cash or issue of ordinary shares at the discretion of the Group up to one year from the date of acquisition.
Due to the short term nature of the liability, the fair value is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value.
In addition, there is a performance related earn-out payment of up to 100 million in cash dependent on the growth delivered by the investment solutions business acquired from Lloyds over the 5 years following completion of the acquisition.
The fair value of the earn-out agreement is determined on a probability weighted expected return analysis of expected cash flows under a number of scenarios, including both internal and external forecasts of the performance of the investment solutions business over the 5 year term, discounted to present value.
The assessment of fair value of deferred consideration involves significant judgement and assumptions relating to potential future revenue and the appropriate discount rate.
Changes in fair value and the unwind of the discount is recognised in the income statement.
There has been no change in fair value since recognition.
Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life and pensions subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which allow clients to benefit from investing in pooled funds.
As explained in note 19, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to these assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
The Company bears no insurance risk.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.
Accordingly, these assets are not included in fair value measurements disclosure on page 128. aberdeen-asset.
com 127 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Fair value of financial instruments continued Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 measurements are derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 investments during the year.
Investments classified as level 3 principally comprise investments in property and infrastructure funds.
While the Group is not aware of significant differences between valuations received and reasonable possible alternatives for the property funds, the value of these investments would be directly impacted by changes in the European and Asian property markets.
The fair value of the infrastructure funds would be impacted by a number of factors described above.
The Group estimates that a 10% increase decrease in the fair value of the investments will have a favourable unfavourable impact on equity of 3.6 million, of which 0.5 million relates to investments in infrastructure funds.
The key assumption in the fair value of the written put option is the relative valuation of the Group and SVG at the time the option is exercised.
The year end valuation is sufficiently above the limit of the 35 million maximum payment such that any change in the assumptions would have limited effect.
Any change in fair value will have a favourable effect on equity.
As discussed above, the fair value of the earn-out agreement included in Level 3 is determined based on a number of unobservable inputs.
A change in one or more of these inputs could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.
On a standalone basis, without the impact of those changes on other variables, changes in the discount rate by - 1% would have an impact of approximately 1 million and a change in revenue growth of - 10% would have an impact of approximately 3 million on the fair value of the earn out respectively.
com 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management Overview This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
i Risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market price risk: foreign exchange risk: and interest rate risk.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Groups risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Boards policies are handled by the risk management committee.
The Board risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board has approved the risk appetite statement, which sets out the quantum and types of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its objectives.
The risk appetite statement is a top-down framework against which policies, systems and limits can be set.
The risk committee monitors compliance with the risk appetite statement through a series of key performance indicators.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables and accrued income.
As detailed in note 29, the carrying value of financial instruments approximate their fair value.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.
As at 30 September 2014 As at 30 September 2013 Not Not AAA AA A BBB rated Total AAA AA A BBB rated Total Group m m m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 26.6 303.3 318.6 4.6 0.8 653.9 18.1 237.4 163.5 7.6 426.6 Company Cash and cash equivalents 154.0 180.1 334.1 100.6 101.4 202.0 No other relevant financial assets are rated.
130 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups treasury policy as approved by the audit committee.
The treasury function manages the cash resources on a daily basis in accordance with the treasury policy, which includes continuously monitoring the credit ratings of all institutions with whom we place deposits.
Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
Outstanding balances are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
As such, no significant level of default is expected.
An analysis of ageing of financial assets is shown below: As at 30 September 2014 As at 30 September 2013 Past due and not impaired Past due and not impaired Neither Neither past Between Between past Between Between due nor 30 and 90 days due nor 30 and 90 days impaired 90 days and 1 year Total impaired 90 days and 1 year Total Group m m m m m m m m Trade receivables 34.4 18.0 3.3 55.7 32.2 14.1 2.8 49.1 Company Trade receivables 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.4 All other financial assets are neither past due nor impaired.
Details of provisions against trade receivables at 30 September are as follows: 2014 2013 Group m m Trade receivables provision: Balance at 1 October 0.7 0.5 Bad debt charge release in the year 0.5 0.2 Balance at 30 September 0.2 0.7 This is a 100% provision held against specific gross trade receivable balances of 0.2 million at 30 September 2014 2013: 0.7 million.
There are no provisions against trade receivables in the Company.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
The average level of debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, represents approximately 2.5 months revenue.
At 30 September 2014 the Group had four 2013: three individual clients with greater than 1 million outstanding.
The total outstanding was 24.1 million 2013: 5.3 million.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
The Group operates and manages a number of open end funds and in doing so it seeks to match client redemptions with liquidations.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall, although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
com 131 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Further details on liquidity risks are set out in the discussion of principal risks on pages 44 to 47.
The Group has cash balances of 653.9 million at 30 September 2014.
These cash balances provide the Group with adequate liquidity.
The Group and Company financial liabilities, including the Company's overdraft of 364.0 million 2013: 442.1 million, are repayable within one year or on demand, with the exception of the earn-out agreement with Lloyds note 14.
The maximum earn-out payment is 100 million based on the growth delivered by the investment solutions business through its strategic relationship with Lloyds over the next 5 years.
If targets are achieved, the earn-out is payable between two and five years after completion.
A deferred liability of 53.9 million has been recognised at 30 September 2014 in respect of the earn-out.
The Group has made a commitment to invest up to 31.2 million in infrastructure funds, denominated in several currencies.
26.7 million of this amount remains committed but not yet drawn.
Investment calls can be made on demand primarily over the investment periods of the partnerships.
These periods are due to expire in two to five years time.
Once drawn, committed capital remains invested for the life of the funds.
The Group also has undrawn commitments of 5.0 million in respect of investments in property funds, which can be called on demand.
iv Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
These financial instruments include the Groups investments in seed capital which are invested to support the launch of new funds.
Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds for less than one year.
These investments have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments in property and infrastructure funds are usually for longer term and are measured as available for sale.
This can range from five to seven years for property and over ten years for infrastructure.
Investments are managed on an individual basis and all material buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMB.
The objective of market price risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Board sets the limits for investing seed capital and longer term investments and regularly monitors the exposure.
The following financial assets are exposed to market risk: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Held for trading Seed capital 58.1 69.6 26.6 49.8 Financial investments 27.7 26.0 26.9 25.7 Available for sale financial assets Financial investments 36.6 38.6 9.5 5.6 122.4 134.2 63.0 81.1 The Groups defined benefit pension schemes hold assets which are exposed to market price risk.
Details of these assets are shown in note 32.
132 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Sensitivity analysis is disclosed below in section vii.
v Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk at a transactional and translational level.
Transaction risk is the risk that the domestic value of a foreign currency denominated cash flow will vary adversely.
Translation risk arises from translating the balances of overseas subsidiaries which report their results in a currency other than sterling and therefore the sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group undertakes transactions in a number of currencies and foreign currency risk arises through fluctuations in foreign currency rates changing the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.
Revenues are earned principally from fees which are calculated on the basis of the value of AuM managed for clients and many mandates include investments valued in currencies other than sterling.
The fact that we operate on a global basis, with offices in a number of countries worldwide, means that a proportion of operating costs is also incurred in foreign currencies.
Further, coupons on the 7.0% perpetual cumulative capital notes are paid in US dollars.
Variations in the sterling value of these operating costs and dividends will, to an extent, offset any similar impact of fluctuating exchange rates on revenues.
The Board has therefore decided that it is not appropriate to undertake any specific hedging of the Groups revenues or costs, except under limited circumstances.

The Group receives variable rate interest on cash deposits.
The Company has a variable rate overdraft, which is part of the Group's working capital facility.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: market prices are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: and market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% at each reporting date.
The impact of the assumptions on profit or loss and equity, net of tax, are as follows: 136 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements Group Impact on Impact profit or on profit Impact on Impact on loss or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2014 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 15.9 15.9 15.6 15.6 Sterling Euro 7.5 7.5 4.3 4.3 Sterling Nordic currencies 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 7.4 7.4 9.7 9.7 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 4.8 4.8 Financial investments available for sale 3.0 3.0 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 3.6 3.6 As at 30 September 2013 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 13.0 13.0 12.1 12.1 Sterling Euro 7.5 7.5 4.1 4.1 Sterling Nordic currencies 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 Sterling Singapore dollar 17.5 17.5 22.5 22.5 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 5.7 5.7 Financial investments available for sale 3.2 3.2 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 3.2 3.2 The market price movement sensitivity excludes investments in funds to hedge deferred bonus liabilities, as described in note 20.
Changes in the market price of these investments are offset by movements in deferred bonus liabilities, therefore there is no impact on profit or loss.
This also applies to the Company.
The Group and Company interest rate movement sensitivity has been calculated based on average cash balances held during the year.

The Board receives regular updates on headroom over regulatory capital and supervises key decisions that may impact the future capital position of the Group.
Further information on the Groups regulatory capital position is given below.
The Groups capital structure consists of equity share capital and share premium of 1,030.1 million, retained earnings and 321.6 million perpetual capital securities.
The perpetual capital notes satisfy the requirements of financial reporting standards for treatment as equity and are treated as an element of tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.
138 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements The Group uses cash generated from its operations to pay a progressive dividend.
The Board seeks to avoid further dilutive issuance of new shares and has, since 2010, satisfied vesting of deferred bonus awards by purchasing shares in the market through the EBT.
The EBT now holds sufficient shares to cover all outstanding awards as at 30 September 2014.
"Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive ""CRD IV"", as implemented in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority ""FCA"", the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital."
In common with many other independent asset managers, the Group had operated under the terms of a waiver from the requirement to meet the full consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver was granted by the FCA with effect from January 2007 and remained in place until August 2014.
The Group achieved its objective of eliminating reliance on this waiver and chose not to apply for a renewal of the waiver.
"The Group is required to undertake an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ""ICAAP"", under which the Board quantifies the level of capital required to meet operational risks: this is referred to as the Pillar 2 capital requirement."
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks which may not be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing for the effects of major risks, such as those discussed on pages 44 to 47.
These tests consider how the Group would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and include an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
During the year to 30 September 2014 the acquisition of SWIP added five regulated subsidiaries to the Groups existing five regulated subsidiaries in the United Kingdom.
"Each of the UK subsidiaries is regulated by the FCA, except for Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited, which is regulated by the Prudential Regulatory Authority ""PRA"" as well as the FCA."
There are a further 30 entities in the Group which are subject to regulation in a number of overseas jurisdictions.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited, all others are regulated investment firms and are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The overseas regulated companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by the respective local regulators.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses over their respective regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
31 Related party transactions In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiary undertakings carry out transactions with related parties, as defined by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Material transactions for the year are set out below.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company are shown in note 16.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transactions with related parties: a Compensation of key management personnel of the Group 2014 2013 m m Short-term employee benefits 11.2 10.1 Share-based payments 14.9 13.7 Pension contributions 0.7 0.5 Total 26.8 24.3 Deferred elements of employee benefits outstanding at the year end: Amounts owed to related parties including amounts deferred from previous years 45.4 40.7 The remuneration policy is described in more detail in the remuneration report on pages 66 to 80. aberdeen-asset.

Interest is calculated at GBP Libor 3 month average rate plus 152.53 basis points.
The interest on this loan is included with amounts due from subsidiaries due within one year.
c Post employment benefit plans The Group operates and participates in several post employment benefit plans as detailed in note 32.
The Group contributed the following amounts to defined benefit and defined contribution plans and had amounts outstanding at 30 September each year as follows: Employer Outstanding at contributions 30 September 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan 4.1 18.8 Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc Retirement & Death Benefits Plan 3.3 3.3 DEGI Pension Plan 0.3 0.3 Other defined benefit plans 0.8 0.8 Defined contribution schemes 27.3 22.4 The contribution to the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan in 2013 included a one-off additional contribution offered by the Group to enhance the funding of the scheme.
d Asset management vehicles The Group provides investment management services for a number of collective investment schemes where Group companies directly sponsor or are investment advisors of underlying funds, which meet the criteria or related parties.
In return the Group receives management fees for provision of these services.
These asset management vehicles and the investment management fees are summarised below: Gross Revenues Outstanding at Gross Revenues Outstanding at 2014 30 Sep 2014 2013 30 Sep 2013 m m m m Collective investment schemes 358.4 41.8 281.3 26.8 140 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 32 Retirement benefits The Groups principal form of pension provision is by way of defined contribution schemes operated worldwide.
The Group also operates a small number of legacy defined benefit schemes including: the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan, the Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme and the DEGI Pension Plan.
These defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership and to future service accrual.
The main defined benefit schemes in the UK are based on final salary payments with benefits being adjusted in line with the schemes rules once in payment after retirement.
The level of benefits paid is dependant on a members' length of service and salary prior to retirement.
A funding plan, which aims to eliminate any shortfall in funding, has been agreed between the Trustees of the schemes and the employer.
Annual contributions to the UK schemes under these funding plans are currently 7.5 million.
The defined benefit schemes operated by the Group expose the Group to actuarial risks, including longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Where appropriate, the investment strategy takes the make up of the schemes' membership into account for example investing in assets that broadly aim to partially match some of the liability outflows, which reduces the effect of market movements on funding levels.
Risk in relation to gilt yields has also been mitigated by investing a proportion of the schemes' assets in gilts bonds LDI assets, which will help to offset some of the risk associated with gilt yields.
The total contributions charged to the income statement in respect of the schemes operated by the Group were as follows: 2014 2013 m m i In respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes: Pension cost charged to operating profit: UK schemes 16.3 11.8 Overseas schemes 11.0 10.6 27.3 22.4 ii In respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes: Pension cost charged to operating profit: UK and DEGI schemes 0.4 1.2 Other schemes 1.2 1.5 1.6 2.7 Total pension expense 28.9 25.1 The pension deficits are recognised as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet and are stated before deduction of the related deferred tax asset.
The pension surplus is recognised as a non-current asset in the balance sheet and is stated before deduction of the deferred tax liability.
The pension surplus and deficits of the Group are summarised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Pension surplus deficits Edinburgh Fund Managers Retirement & Death Benefits Plan 16.6 9.7 Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan 9.8 4.9 DEGI Pension Plan 7.1 6.4 Net deficit in main schemes see 4 below 0.3 1.6 Other defined benefit pension schemes 3.3 2.8 Net deficit 3.6 4.4 aberdeen-asset.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
