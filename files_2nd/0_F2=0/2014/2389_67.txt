The average number of shares outstanding excludes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans and treasury shares, which includes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts ESOPs.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
