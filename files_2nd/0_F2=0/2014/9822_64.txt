34 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total potential fide-grouping liability now stands at 8.4 million 2013: 8.4 million, of which 7.9 million 2013: 7.8 million relates to CGT and 0.5 million 2013: 0.6 million relates to SDLT.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 1.4 million 2013: 2.6 million and a letter of credit in favour of Aviva totalling 1.0 million 2013: 0.5 million to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letters of credit are secured on fixed deposits for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the Trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
