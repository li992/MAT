Non-consumable inventories comprise items like glassware, plates, cutlery and cleaning products used in the pubs and hotels.
The company has taken a more prudent view on recognition of non-consumable inventories as expenses.
The change in the accounting policy for the expected life of those inventories resulted in an exceptional charge of 5,231,000 2014: Nil.
The effect of this change was not presented as a prior-year adjustment, as management did not believe that previously reported results were materially affected and the treatment adopted provides full information.
In the table above, property impairment relates to the situation in which, owing to poor trading performance, pubs are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their current book value.
The onerous lease provision relates to pubs for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover the rent.
The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub, but also the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a possible outcome.
In the year, 1,858,000 2014: Nil was charged in respect of onerous leases.
14 J D WETHERSPOON PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4 Exceptional items continued In the year, an exceptional charge of 11,195,000 2014: Nil was incurred in respect of the impairment of property, plant and equipment, as required under IAS 36.
This comprises an impairment charge of 12,383,000 2014: Nil, offset by impairment reversals of 1,188,000 2014: Nil.
A reduction in the deferred tax liability on rolled-over gains for differences between the tax-deductible cost and the residual value of the reinvestment assets has resulted in a credit of 4,809,000.
Owing to the magnitude of the reduction and the fact that it relates to prior periods, it was considered exceptional.

Dividend cover is calculated as profit after tax and exceptional items over dividend paid.
Assumptions are used about sales, costs and profit, using a pre-tax discount rate for future years of 8% 2014: 9%.
If the value, based on future anticipated cash flows, is lower than the book value, the difference is written off as property impairment.
As a result of this exercise, a net impairment loss of 10,705,000 2014: 1,192,000 was charged to property losses in the income statement, as described in note 3.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each pub, could cause the carrying value of the pub to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.

Capital risk management The companys capital structure comprises shareholders equity and loans.
The objective of capital management is to ensure that the company is able to continue as a going concern and provide shareholders with returns on their investment, while managing risk.
The company does not have a specific measure for managing capital structure: instead, the company plans its capital requirements and manages its loans, dividends and share buybacks accordingly.
The company measures loans using a ratio of net debt to EBITDA which was 3.37 times 2014: 3.21 times at the year end.
Section 2 on page 42 discusses the financial risks associated with financial instruments, including credit risk and liquidity risk.
Obligations under finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Within one year 2,101 2,801 In the second to fifth year, inclusive 2,101 2,101 4,902 Less future finance charges 50 203 Present value of lease obligations 2,051 4,699 Less amount due for settlement within one year 2,051 2,801 Amount due for settlement during the second to fifth year, inclusive 1,898 All finance lease obligations are in respect of various equipment and software used in the business.

The table below highlights any differences between book value and fair value of financial instruments.

The fair value of derivatives has been calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at the year ends prevailing interest rates.
Interest-rate swaps At 26 July 2015, the company had fixed-rate swaps designated as hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The floating-rate borrowings are interest-bearing borrowings at rates based on LIBOR, fixed for periods of up to six months.
The interest-rate swaps of the floating-rate borrowings were assessed to be effective: a cumulative net loss of 39,973,000 2014: a loss of 30,166,000, with a deferred tax credit of 7,994,000 2014: a credit of 6,033,000, relating to the hedging instrument, is included in equity.
A debit of 9,807,000 2014: credit of 13,879,000 before deferred tax for the year is reflected in equity.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level, using the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data level 3 The fair value of the interest-rate swaps of 40.0m is considered to be level 2.
All other financial assets and liabilities are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost, and their valuation is also considered to be level 2.
