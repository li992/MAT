Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 42.
Segmental Information as Reported to the Board in 2014 The tables below reflect the information reported to the Board for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance in 2014.
The definition of the segments focus on the geographic spread of the business in order to gain advantage of local market and customer understanding.
Some of these segments were redefined in 2014 and the tables below and their comparatives have been restated for those changes reflected in the information reported to the board.
Note 5 of these financial statements shows the view of the business going forwards and therefore include additional reorganisations that will be reflected in information reported to the Board in 2015.
Changes from the segments defined in the prior year financial statements include the separation of the UK & Europe division into two new divisions UK Central Government and UK & Europe Local & Regional Government.
This follows the Cabinet Office review across Serco contracts with UK Central Government, which resulted in Sercos agreement with the UK Government to undertake a process of corporate renewal, to strengthen governance and transparency which included the separation of the UK & Europe segment into these two new segments.
Other 2014 reorganisations of business units and changes of reporting to the Board include the separation of the former AMEAA segment into the new AsPac and Middle East segments, and the transfer of citizen services contracts from Global Services to UK Central Government.
The prior year comparative segment information has been restated to reflect these changes.
