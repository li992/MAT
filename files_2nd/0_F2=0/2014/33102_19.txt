Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The total fees earned by CBRE and Savills from the Company represent less than 5% of their total UK revenues.
CBRE and Savills have continuously been the signatory of valuations for the Company since October 2007 and September 2010 respectively.
In the 2012 financial statements, investment property in the course of construction at Clerkenwell Quarter, Islington was valued by the Directors at 10.4 million.

There have been no transfers of properties between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended 31 March 2014.
The fair value at 31 March 2014 represents the highest and best use.
i Technique The valuation techniques described below are consistent with IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs.
There have been no changes in valuation techniques since the prior year.
Yield capitalisation for commercial investment properties, market rental values are capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the net initial yields and the fair market values per square foot derived from recent market transactions.
Residual for investment properties under development, the fair value of the property is calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the yield capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
Comparison for residential properties the fair value is calculated by using data from recent market transactions.
ii Sensitivity An increase or decrease in ERV will increase or decrease the fair value of the Groups investment properties.
An increase or decrease to the net initial yields and reversionary yields will decrease or increase the fair value of the Groups investment properties.
An increase or decrease in the estimated costs of development will decrease or increase the fair value of the Group's investment properties under development.
There are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions: an increase in more than one input could magnify or mitigate the impact on the valuation.

b Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Groups financial risk management objectives are to minimise the effect of risks it is exposed to through its operations and the use of debt financing.
The principal financial risks to the Group and the policies it has in place to manage these risks are summarised below: i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash deposits and trade receivables.
The Group mitigates financial loss from tenant defaults by dealing with only creditworthy tenants.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Cash is placed on deposit with a diverse mix of institutions with suitable credit ratings and rates of return and for varying periods of time.
The credit ratings of the banks are monitored and changes are made where necessary to manage risk.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
