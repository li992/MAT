Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 In preparing the 2014 financial statements, we have grouped notes into sections under six key categories which are considered to be most relevant for shareholders and other users: 1.
Result for the year 3. Financing the Groups activities 4.
The Companys financial statements The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer commentary on the financial performance of the Group.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Afren plc the Company, and together with its subsidiaries, the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is Kinnaird House, 1 Pall Mall East, London SW1Y 5AU, England.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2.2 and in the Chairmans and Chief Executives statement and Operations review on pages 10 and 36.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.5.
1.2 Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil inventory which is subject to certain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value.
1.3 Going concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting.
The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the Groups current and forecast financing position.
Additional details, including a description of a material uncertainty relating to going concern, are provided in the Directors report.
1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The accounting policy is as follows: Control is achieved where the Company has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
The determination of whether control exists includes fide facto circumstances that give the Company power over the investee irrespective of the Groups shareholding.
Where the Group has an interest in a joint operation, those interests are accounted for using proportionate consolidation under which the Group records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of the acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.5 Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated as required into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences if any arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the translation occurs.
At present the Group has no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.
114 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance 1.6 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above and in Sections 2 to 5, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key assumptions made by the Directors, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Going concern Information regarding the uncertainties in the Groups going concern assumption are detailed within the Directors report on page 76.
Carrying value of oil and gas assets Management assesses the Groups oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment at least annually, with reference to indicators in IAS 36.
Note 4.4 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets and details of the key assumptions used, which include a production profile based on managements best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets, an oil price profile and a tailored post-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets Management assesses impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and the specific facts and circumstances of each asset.
Note 4.3 discloses the carrying value of such assets.
In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans, including availability of financing, towards finding commercial reserves.
In the current year, these judgements have been made in light of the Groups funding position and the impact of low oil prices, as further described in our Operations review of the Directors report.
The nature of exploration and evaluation activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately successful and assets may be impaired in future periods.
Amounts due to participants in fields Included within Trade and other payables described in note 5.5 to the financial statements is a balance as at 31 December 2014 of US$310.2 million of Other creditors and operating Partners due under the contractual agreements through which the Group participates in its fields 31 December 2013: US$366.0 million.
In calculating certain amounts included within this balance, aspects of these agreements can be unclear and potentially open to interpretation and negotiation, for example, the level of costs which will be agreed as recoverable capital expenditure, levels of allowable overhead, applicable tax rate or financing charges allocable to individual assets.
Management has recorded such amounts at its best estimate, having considered a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
However, this estimation uncertainty could potentially lead to a material gain or loss in future periods, as and when the interpretation of the underlying agreements is confirmed with the relevant counterparties.
Decommissioning Provision for environmental clean-up and associated costs depend on the legal requirements at the date of decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
Decommissioning provisions are updated each year to reflect managements best estimates of future cost estimates and timings as described in note 4.4.
Taxation and royalties The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation.
In particular, in Nigeria there is uncertainty in respect of the calculation of the tax holiday for the Ebok asset, the calculation of the royalties in respect of Ebok production and in a number of other less significant areas.
Afren calculates the tax charge for the period using the latest information available, taking external advice where necessary, in order to arrive at our best estimate of the final tax position in accordance with the tax legislation enacted in the year.
Details of the key judgements made by management relating to the assumptions used in accounting for the effects of a tax holiday for the Ebok asset in Nigeria are included in notes 2.3 and 5.16.
Judgements are required when estimating the future unwinding of temporary differences and the relevant tax rates at which temporary differences will unwind for the purposes of valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities.
These estimates are updated at each reporting period.
Revisions to our tax liabilities either upward or downward may occur as the Groups tax filings and royalties are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.
Our tax charge and estimate of our tax liabilities is disclosed in note 2.3.
Restatement of 2013 financial statements During the year, an independent review was performed by Willkie Farr & Gallagher UK LLP WFG into the potential need for disclosure to the market of three prior transactions.
In light of additional information that was brought to light as a result of the independent review the Company has undertaken an extensive review of the accounting for these transactions.
Management has reassessed certain accounting judgements made in the prior year and has concluded that it is appropriate to restate the financial Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 115 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 statements at 31 December 2013 in relation to one of these transactions in order to reflect subsequent changes in judgements.
No material adjustments were identified at 31 December 2012.
As such, although compliance with IAS 1 would generally require the presentation of a statement of financial position at the start of the period of the restatement 1 January 2013, this has been omitted.
The review covered three transactions as discussed below.
i First agreement with Oriental Energy July 2012 In July 2012, Afren agreed to advance US$100 million to Oriental Energy Resources Limited Oriental the First Oriental Agreement.
The contractual documentation was drawn up on the basis that the payment was in effect an advance purchase of Orientals oil from Ebok.
As a result of this transaction a loan of US$100.0 million to Oriental was included in Afrens balance sheet for 31 December 2012 under the line Prepayments and advances to Partners.
Although the investigation highlighted that the disclosure around this financial instrument was insufficient, with additional disclosure required in the trade and other receivables and fair values note, in the 31 December 2012 and 2013 financial statements the review did not highlight any material change in either the Group balance sheet or the Group statement of comprehensive income as at 31 December 2012 or 2013.
As at 31 December 2014 Afren has fully recovered this loan.
As such, management has not made any restatement as a result of this transaction although additional disclosure has been provided within note 5.4 via the inclusion of narrative that the US$100.0 million loan is included within the advance to Partners line, and note 5.6 by including the amortised cost of the US100.0 million loan within the financial assets section.
ii Second agreement with Oriental Energy August 2013 On 23 August 2013, Afren Resources Limited ARL and Oriental entered into an agreement the Amendment Agreement to amend the Ebok Joint Operating Agreement the JOA.
The material terms of this Amendment Agreement were that ARL agreed to pay Oriental US$300.0 million in return for ARL acquiring the benefits from certain additional tax allowances and increasing ARLs share of oil revenues from Ebok via the cost recovery mechanism of the JOA.
The Amendment Agreement was conditional on Pioneer status a five-year tax holiday being confirmed for Ebok, which occurred in October 2013.
The US$300.0 million was paid in two instalments.
US$180.0 million was paid in August 2013 in advance of Pioneer status being confirmed and US$120.0 million was paid in November 2013.
At 31 December 2013, the payments were reflected in the Group balance sheet as full payment for the incremental deferred tax asset of US$298.0 million acquired under this transaction and the residual balance of US$2.0 million as an asset within Property, plant and equipment PPE.
In light of the WFG review, management has reassessed certain accounting judgements and concluded that it is appropriate to restate the 2013 financial statements.
The US$300.0 million consideration paid has been allocated on a relative fair value basis as follows: 1 US$120.0 million of the amount paid represents the fair value of the acquisition of Orientals 50% share of capital allowances and should remain classified within deferred tax assets in the Group balance sheet.
This deferred tax asset has been subsequently remeasured at 31 December 2013 in accordance with IAS 12 Deferred Tax to US$298.0 million and taken through the income tax credit line of the income statement.
2 US$180.0 million of the amount paid represents the fair value of a purchase by ARL of Orientals 2013 entitlement to net operating cash flows from the field.
Orientals 2013 entitlement under the JOA arose partially retrospectively as a consequence of the granting of Pioneer status.
As this amount was assessed to have been fully recovered by the end of 2013, it has been allocated to cost of sales in 2013 in line with the Groups accounting policies.
Management judgement was required in the assessment of whether there were sufficient grounds to re-open the prior year judgement as to the allocation of the US$300.0 million consideration.
Further judgement was required in selecting the best accounting treatment as some aspects of the accounting interpretation of this transaction by the investigating accountants was at variance with that adopted by the Company in its 2013 financial statements.
Therefore the Board commissioned independent accounting advice from another major accounting firm before reaching its decision.
The Directors believe the restated accounting is appropriate having taken into account all of the views and advice received and all the information available and better reflects the substance of the transaction.
The effect is to increase cost of sales by US$178.0 million, decrease profit before tax by US$178.0 million and increase income tax credit by US$178.0 million: there is no impact to net assets or profit after tax following the restatement.
iii Amendment of Production Sharing and Technical Services Agreement with Amni December 2013 In December 2013, Amni International Petroleum Development Company Limited Amni, Afren Energy Resources Limited AER, Afren and Okoro Limited entered into a number of agreements to resolve a dispute regarding whether the Okoro East development would go ahead due to the differing economic benefits each was receiving from Okoro.
The dispute arose as a result of a difference in tax rates in Nigeria paid by Afren and Amni.
Pursuant to a resolution agreement the Amni Resolution Agreement AER agreed to pay US$100.0 million together with interest of US$9.0 million due under Amnis facility with the United Bank of Africa plc as referred to below.
As part of the resolution of the dispute an amended and restated Production Sharing and Technical Services Agreement the Amended PSTSA was entered into.
AER agreed to pay the US$100.0 million in instalments.
However, in order to access the full US$100.0 million immediately Amni entered into a loan agreement with United Bank of Africa plc UBA and Afren issued a bank guarantee to the value of US$70.0 million to UBA in respect of Amnis financial obligations to UBA the Amni Guarantee.
At 31 December 2013, US$31.6m of the agreed payment had been paid to Amni.
116 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance The review confirmed Afren received value from the Amended PSTSA and further did not highlight any material change in either the Group balance sheet or the Group statement of comprehensive income as at 31 December 2012 or 2013.
As at 31 December 2014, US$65.8m of the balance is outstanding.
No adjustment was required in relation to the financial guarantee provided to UBA previously disclosed as a contingent liability.
2.0 Result for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages are disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, normalised profit after tax and loss earnings per share.
2.1 Revenues Revenue represents the sales value of the Groups share of oil liftings in the year, net of VAT, net profit interest obligations and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren.
Oil revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
All revenues in the current and prior year were derived from the sale of oil.
A portion of the Groups oil revenue was cash flow hedged during the year.
The amounts disclosed above for oil revenue include the recycling from the hedging reserve of the effective amount of cash flow hedges that were used to hedge the oil price.
The amount included in revenue is US$11.3 million 2013: US$ nil.
Further details can be found in note 3.3.
2.2 Segmental reporting a Geographical segments The Group operates in three geographical markets which form the basis of the information evaluated by the Group: Nigeria and other West Africa, East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
This is the basis on which the Group records its primary segment information.
Unallocated operating expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the general management, financing and administration of the Group.
Assets in Cote dIvoire which were sold during 2013 note 5.14 are included in the Nigeria and other West Africa segment for management purposes but have been deducted in a separate column in the analysis below to enable a reconciliation to the income statement.
The results of these assets are disclosed as discontinued operations in the 2013 income statement.

As the sale of oil is made on global markets, the Group does not place reliance on the largest customers mentioned above.
118 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance b Business segments The operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, development and production.
2.3 Taxation The Group is subject to various forms of taxation in the countries in which it operates.
These include income tax on profits, royalties on production, sales taxes on revenues generated, and payroll taxes on benefits to employees.
a Income tax credit The income tax credit represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The 2013 amount includes a credit in respect of the reversal of prior period taxes no longer expected to be payable, and recognition of deferred tax assets described further below.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
1 Restated 2014 2013 US$m US$m Current tax UK Corporation tax Overseas corporation tax 24.7 239.2 Effect of initial recognition of tax holiday 254.3 Adjustment in respect of prior years 27.6 10.5 2.9 25.6 Deferred tax Deferred tax 301.0 61.6 Effect of initial recognition of tax holiday 370.7 301.0 309.1 Total income tax credit 303.9 334.7 1 Refer to notes 1.6 and 5.15 of the Group financial statements.
The income tax credit is different from the expected income tax expense for the following reasons: 1 Restated 2014 2013 US$m US$m Loss profit for the year 1,955.0 140.1 Tax at the UK Corporation tax rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% 420.3 32.6 Tax effect of items which are not deductible for tax 130.5 32.7 Items not subject to tax 4.0 4.3 Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 92.6 195.0 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 27.1 9.4 Change in temporary differences deductible after the end of the tax holiday 81.4 Loss not recognised 5.8 31.8 Effect of initial recognition of tax holiday 223.1 Total income tax credit 303.9 334.7 1 Refer to notes 1.6 and 5.15 of the Group financial statements.
During 2014, the Group continued to apply the benefits of a tax holiday in respect of its Ebok asset in Nigeria.
Afren Resources Limited, the subsidiary which holds Afrens interest in the Ebok asset, received a certificate in 2013 awarding a five-year tax holiday which is effective from 1 June 2011 until May 2016.
As a result, no income tax is payable in respect of the 20112016 period.
The adjustment in respect of prior years relates to the release of a provision following the conclusion of a tax audit within Afren Energy Resources Limited.
On 26 January 2015, Afren Resources Limited received a letter from the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission informing that the initial tax holiday period had been reduced from five to three years.
If enforced, the tax holiday would have effectively ceased on 31 May 2014, although two further annual periods of extension can be applied for in order to restore the full five-year term.
Afren intends to contest the reduction and apply for the two annual extensions as necessary.
If it is the case that neither of these actions are successful, the income tax credit would decrease by US$87.1 million a sum of additional current income tax and a reduction in the deferred tax credit from US$303.9 million to US$216.8 million, with a corresponding US$3.6 million increase in current income tax payable from US$15.7 million to US$19.3 million as at 31 December 2014, and a decrease in deferred tax asset from US$348.2 million to US$264.7 million as at 31 December 2014.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 119 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 b Deferred taxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.

Table also restated to provide meaningful comparatives to 2014 balances.
ii Unrecognised deferred tax assets At the balance sheet date, the Group also had tax losses primarily arising in the UK of US$533.7 million 2013: US$297.5 million in respect of which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group had temporary differences of US$31.3 million 2013: US$23.3 million in respect of share-based payments, property, plant and equipment and pensions in respect of which deferred tax assets have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the largest proportion of dividends would be from subsidiaries where no additional tax would be applied on dividend income.
2.4 Reconciliation of loss profit before tax to normalised profit before tax Normalised profit before tax is a non-IFRS measure of financial performance of the Group, which in managements view provides a better understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 121 2.5 Loss earnings per ordinary share Loss earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax loss or profit attributable to each share.
Where a profit or loss in the period from a discontinued operation has occurred, this profit or loss is factored into the EPS calculation in order to present a Group result from continuing operations.
Basic EPS from continuing operations is calculated on the Groups loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders of US$1,623.2 million 2013: US$478.3 million profit attributable to equity shareholders divided by 1,102.8 million 2013: 1,090.8 million being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all share options and warrants being exercised.
Potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the current years computation as they would serve to decrease the loss per share.

122 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance 3.0 Financing the Groups activities This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Afren: specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity further details in note 3.5 and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt further details in notes 3.1 and 3.2 in order to finance the Groups business strategy, both now and in the future and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Directors consider that debt and equity are both capital, and managing net debt as disclosed below is the key strategy for managing capital.
The maturity of the Groups borrowings and other debt facilities is considered a key performance metric.
An indicator of the maturity of the capital structure, future commitments and financial flexibility is relevant to the Group.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and funding requirements a minimum of twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business strategy.
The Groups funding requirements are met through a combination of debt, equity and operational cash flow.
Important additional information relating to the Groups funding and liquidity position is included in the Directors report on page 77.
3.1 Net debt and cash flow commitments Key cash flow activity in the year The Group invested US$651.2 million in exploration and evaluation activities and in developing its oil and gas assets, the majority funded from operating cash flow.
During 2014, US$90.0 million was drawn down on the Ebok facility, US$60.0 million on the Okwok facility and US$100.0 million on the OML 26 bank facility which replaced a US$80.0 million facility.
Net debt Net debt is the key measure by which the Group monitors its funding.
Net debt is defined as borrowings, less finance lease liabilities, net of cash and cash equivalents.

These typically have a fixed interest rate and are for a fixed term.
The interest and other costs payable on these borrowings are shown in note 3.6.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings including senior loan notes are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Interest is calculated by applying the coupon rate to the redemption value.

Its value changes over time in response to a change to underlying variables such as crude oil price.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
If the Group does not apply hedge accounting to the derivatives, gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating income expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the Group hedge accounts for the derivatives, each period the portion of the gains and losses on the cash flow hedging instruments that is determined to be an effective hedge is taken to equity other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, is recognised in the income statement.
Third party valuations are used to value the Groups derivatives.
During the year, the Group used the following derivatives: Purpose Hedge accounting Commodity deferred put options cash flow hedges a Hedge against the price of crude oil falling Yes Interest rate swap b To link interest payments to the performance of certain No indices that look to take advantage of a theoretical bias in the forward curve Foreign exchange hedge c Hedge against changes in the USD GBP exchange rate No Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 125 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 a Commodity deferred put options During the year, the Group received a minimum amount if the market price of crude oil fell.
These instruments were classified as cash flow hedges, with the portion of the gains and losses on the instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and subsequently recycled as the hedged transaction occurs and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, recognised directly in the income statement for each period.
During the year, a loss of US$7.0 million 2013: US$30.8 million was reflected directly in the income statement in relation to these instruments and a further gain of US$98.8 million was taken to equity in the year, of which US$11.3 million was recycled in relation to hedged sales in 2014 with the balance of US$87.5 million to be recycled in future years.
The Group had no open oil price derivative contracts as at 31 December 2014. b Interest rate swap The Group entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby it receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate with a downside cap up to a maximum of 2% above the fixed rate coupon.
During the year, the Group recognised a loss in its income statement of US$1.8 million 2013: US$15.7 million in respect of these contracts.
c Foreign exchange rate contracts To manage its exposure to changes in the US Dollar Sterling exchange rate, from time to time the Group will enter into forward contracts.
During the year, the Group recognised a loss in its income statement of US$0.1 million 2013: US$0.1 million in respect of these contracts.
d Options contracts for FHN shares The put call options are classed as options over own equity.

All other leases are classified as operating leases.
For a finance lease, an asset and corresponding liability is recognised on the balance sheet.
No asset or liability is recognised for an operating lease.
Finance lease assets are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Obligations under finance lease The Group has a seven-year lease of a Mobile Offshore Production Unit MOPU and a Floating Storage Offloading Vessel FSO from Mercator Offshore Nigeria Limited in respect of the production operations of the Ebok field, offshore Nigeria.
The carrying amount of the Groups lease obligations approximates its fair value.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the effective interest rate was 6% 2013: 6%.

The so called cash box method of effecting an issue of shares for cash is commonplace and enabled the Company to issue shares without giving rise to any share premium.
Following the impairment of underlying assets, during the current year, the merger reserve was transferred to accumulated losses.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 127 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 3.6 Finance costs Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the term of the debt.
Borrowing costs, including interest on loans, which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised in line with the underlying asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

During 2013, borrowing costs were capitalised to the Barda Rash field in the Kurdistan region of Iraq using a weighted average of approximately 12.0%.
Total expenses incurred in relation to the bond issue amounted to US$nil in the current year 2013: US$6.4 million.
These are being amortised over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method.
b Interest costs Interest amounting to US$102.9million 2013: US$115.7 million before capitalisation of some of the interest to oil and gas assets under development, has been charged to the income statement for the year to 31 December 2014.
Interest on loans incurred on any qualifying capital expenditure relating to an asset under construction e. g. during pre-production phase is capitalised and forms part of the capital allowance pool for taxation purposes.
Interest on loans incurred after an asset is fully constructed e. g. on commencement of production is expensed immediately.
The Group does not compute or pay taxes in respect of Barda Rash in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
c Cost of extinguishment of loan notes During 2013, the cost of extinguishment of loan notes included the premium paid to redeem US$246.6 million and US$50.0 million of the 2016 and 2019 senior secured loan notes, respectively.
128 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance 4.0 Oil and gas activities This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in Section 3.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
On the following pages there are disclosures showing intangible and tangible oil and gas assets, capital commitments, inventories, interests in other entities and contingent liabilities.
Other working capital balances are shown in Section 5.
4.1 Licences summary The Group has interests in oil and gas licences at the three different stages of the operational work programme cycle exploration, appraisal and development, and production.
Further details on each licence and the stage of the work programme can be found on pages 36 to 55 and on page 156.
The classifications reflect the stage of each work programme from an operational perspective, as explained further in the Operations review.
The classification within the financial statements may be different due to the criteria for determining when the work programme has moved from exploration intangible oil and gas assets to development and then to production both categories within tangible oil and gas assets being different under accounting standards.
4.2 Oil and gas reserves Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves also commonly referred to as 2P reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
The Groups commercial reserves as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 are detailed in the table on page 157 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
These commercial reserves are stated on a working interest basis, excluding any amounts provided to Partners to settle net profit interest obligations, and have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE.
The commercial reserves are unaudited.
The commercial reserves are used in a number of ways in the financial statements: in particular: 1 to assess whether a prospect is commercially viable and in the estimation of the recoverable amount of oil and gas assets both intangible and property, plant and equipment : and 2 in the calculation of depletion of the property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets.
4.3 Intangible exploration and evaluation assets The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities.
Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.

Additions during 2013 included the acquisition of an interest in OML 115 offshore Nigeria, drilling Simrit-3 and Maqlub-1 wells on the Ain Sifni licence in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, drilling Ogo-1 well on OPL 310 offshore Nigeria, and further drilling and testing of Okwok in advance of the submission of the field development plan.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 129 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 b Transfer to property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets Non-current assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the recoverable amount.
Such triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of exploration and evaluation assets and include the point at which determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
If prospects are deemed to be commercially viable on completion of the evaluation, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment in single field cost centres.
Prospects deemed to be commercially viable, and transferred to property, plant and equipment during the current year, relate to Okwok and OML 113 in Nigeria.
As part of this assessment, management performed an impairment test upon these assets, on transfer from intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
This test compared the carrying value of the assets at the date of transfer with their recoverable amount based on the expected discounted cash flows from each prospect.
For the discounted cash flow to be calculated, management used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an oil price profile and a post-tax discount rate of 10% which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management consider to be reflective of the risks specific to those projects.
Based on this assessment, no impairments were recognised in the income statement, on either asset.
No impairment assessment was performed in 2013 as there were no similar triggering events as defined in IFRS 6. c Exploration costs written-off If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful efforts on making the above determination as to whether commercial reserves exist or as a result of other factors such as a lack of planned future expenditure, the associated costs are charged to the income statement.
2014 2013 US$m US$m Exploration costs written off 839.1 60.5 Amounts written off in 2014 include the write down of exploration and evaluation assets in the Kurdistan region of Iraq US$265.2 million following receipt of an updated third party reserve report and Ghana US$39.0 million following an economic evaluation.
In addition, following a review of licence requirements in conjunction with the constraints affecting funding availability, full impairments have been recorded against assets in Cote dIvoire US$115.4 million, Kenya US$129.5 million, Tanzania US$36.3 million, Madagascar US$51.8 million, Seychelles US$61.0 million, Ethiopia US$82.1 million, Congo Brazzaville US$1.6 million and South Africa US$14.3 million.
A partial impairment was also recognised against OML 115 in Nigeria US$42.9 million relating to unsuccessful well costs incurred on a specific prospect.
Amounts written off in 2013 relate to the cumulative costs of Block 10A in Kenya, following the decision to relinquish the block, and the Groups share of costs of drilling Kola 1 and Kola 2 wells on the La Noumbi licence in Congo Brazzaville.
Kola 1 and Kola 2 were drilled in 2013 and, following conclusion that the wells were unsuccessful, they were plugged and abandoned.
4.4 Property, plant and equipment Oil and gas assets Development assets are costs incurred to obtain access to oil and gas reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering, and storing oil and gas.
Examples include costs incurred to gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling: drill development wells, including cost of platforms and well equipment: acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as ease flow lines, separators, treaters, and heaters: and other items as appropriate.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are transferred into development assets once the property has proved reserves and a development plan approved by all relevant parties including, where applicable, the government.
Production assets are those properties which have begun producing.
These assets are typically development properties which are transferred into the production portfolio or through acquisition of a subsidiary.
Once commercial production starts on a development asset, the property is reclassified as a production asset and depletion of the property commences.
Other property, plant and equipment assets Other property, plant and equipment comprise the Groups investment in leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, and computer hardware and software.
It is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Additions during 2013 included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok field of US$274.1 million, Okoro development of US$104.1 million, OML 26 of US$7.9 million and the Barda Rash field of US$224.1 million.
b Provisions A provision for decommissioning the oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
The provision represents the present value of the decommissioning costs relating to Ebok, Okoro, OML 26 and Okwok fields that are expected to be incurred up to 2033.
A provision relating to Barda Rash has also been recognised in the current year, following the write off of the asset in the year.
No provision had been recognised in previous years as it had been expected that the asset would be returned to the government or another contractor prior to any decommissioning liabilities being incurred.
Management have since reassessed the likelihood of the Group being responsible for decommissioning liabilities and as a result have recognised a US$21.0 million provision during the period.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 131 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 Following the disposal of the Groups interest in CI-11, the related provision was released in 2013.
The table below details the movements in the provision.
2014 2013 Current Non-current Current Non-current US$m US$m US$m US$m At 1 January 30.1 39.4 Addition during the year 2.0 1.6 Unwinding of discount 2.7 2.2 Disposal of subsidiary 10.7 Effects of changes to decommissioning estimates 21.0 9.2 2.4 At 31 December 21.0 44.0 30.1 A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment within additions.
The amount recognised is the Groups share of the estimated future cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements, reflecting managements best estimates, and external reports where relevant.
Additions during 2014 relate to provisions for abandonment of additional wells drilled at the Ebok, Okoro and OML 26 fields, as well as facilities at Okwok.
Management believes the estimates continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
c Depreciation, depletion and amortisation Oil and gas assets Oil and gas assets are amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production on working interest basis to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves, generally on a field by field basis.
Production used for the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation includes any amounts provided to Partners to settle residual net profit interest liabilities, on which no revenue is generated.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs.
Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
The gas plant was being depreciated straight-line over six and a quarter years but was sold in 2013.
Included in the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge during the year is US$16.7 million 2013: US$28.8 million attributable to the assets under finance lease in respect of the Ebok field.
Other property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the property, plant and equipment, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life as follows: Leasehold improvements life of lease Fixtures and equipment over three years all artwork paintings depreciated over 15 years Computer hardware and software over three years 132 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance d Impairment Impairment Non-current assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing fair value less costs of disposal, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Fair value less costs to sell is identified as the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
The impairment of property, plant and equipment relates to Barda Rash in the Kurdistan region of Iraq US$932.6 million and Ebok in Nigeria US$273.0 million.
An updated reserves report has been received which, on the basis of extended well testing and greater knowledge surrounding well performance compared to the previous report received in 2011, indicated Barda Rash only has contingent resources.
As these contingent resources are considered to require more capital to develop than aligns with the Groups priorities, it is not expected that the Company will undertake the development previously planned.
Given the current market environment, there are significant uncertainties around any estimated sale value and the asset has been impaired in full.
Following the sharp decline in forecast oil prices, an impairment test has been performed in respect of Ebok, which has resulted in a reduction in the estimated recoverable value of the asset to US$683.4 million and the recognition of a US$273.0 million impairment charge.
The recoverable value of Ebok at 31 December 2014 has been determined on a fair value less costs of disposal basis using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates cash flows to 2025.
In calculating discounted cash flows, management has made the following key assumptions: Production volumes: Estimates are based on detailed independent forecasts for the field and take into account the development plan agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process: Discount rate: A 10% real post-tax discount rate has been used which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks specific to the Ebok asset.
Crude oil price: Management uses a real long-term price assumption of US$90 bbl for calculation of future cash flows.
In addition, in light of the ongoing communication relating to the applicable royalties regime, as disclosed in note 1.6, and the limitation of Pioneer certificate, as disclosed in note 5.16, the Group has reflected in the fair value less costs to sell assessment the estimated probabilities of unfavourable outcome of both disputes.
As a result of the impairment of Ebok, there has been an associated increase in the deferred tax asset which has been assessed for recoverability as described in note 2.3 b.
The fair value estimate which includes future capital spend and other input assumptions not derived from an observable market is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement, see note 5.6.
No previous measurement was undertaken as there were no previous impairment indicators.
4.5 Capital commitments Capital commitments in respect of property, plant and equipment and intangible exploration and evaluation assets are outlined in note 3.1.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 133 4.6 Inventories Oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Groups jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period.
The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production is underlift or overlift.
Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlements basis.
Spare parts and materials inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
The cash flows associated with the purchase of spare parts and materials are classified in investing activities with the oil and gas assets.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The table details the carrying value of inventories as at 31 December: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Oil inventory 61.8 30.0 Spare parts and materials 102.9 50.9 164.7 80.9 Oil inventory is mainly comprised of Ebok, US$28.1 million 549,960 bbls valued at $51.04 bbl and Okoro, US$33.7 million 594,245 bbls valued at $56.74 bbl.
Oil inventories are stated net of a provision of US$12.1 million 2013: US$ nil to write down inventory to net realisable value.
Spare parts and materials are stated net of a provision of US$3.1 million 2013: US$1.6 million to write down the inventory to net realisable value.
The increase in inventory relates largely to materials to be consumed in future development drilling activities.
4.7 Interests in other entities Joint arrangements are those arrangements where the Group shares joint control.
Such arrangements may be classified as either a joint venture the Group has an interest in the net assets of the jointly controlled entity, or a joint operation the Group has joint rights to the assets and joint obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
The Group applies equity accounting for joint ventures and accounts for its share for joint operations on a line by line basis.
a Subsidiaries A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation, and proportion of ownership interest, is given in note 6.2 to the Companys separate financial statements.
Details of the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned are provided in note 5.10. b Joint ventures During 2014, the Group recognised a loss from its share in joint ventures of US$1.7 million 2013: US$26.6 million.
The loss comprises the write-off of the Groups interest in joint ventures of US$1.7 million 2013: US$8.4 million and impairment of amounts receivable from the joint venture of US$ nil 2013: US$18.2 million.
134 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance 4.8 Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence of one or more future events that are beyond the control of the Group.
Furthermore, present obligations may constitute contingent liabilities if it is possible that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, if, however, a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.

iv D uring 2014, the Group received a letter from the Department of Petroleum Resources DPR in Nigeria stating that, as from 4 July 2014, marginal fields would be subject to revised fiscal terms.
The impact of this for the Group in 2014 is estimated to be US$25.4 million although the overall economic impact is estimated to be lower at US$20.5 million due to Partner recoveries.
The Directors intend to appeal this revision and believe, on the basis of legal advice received, that the outcome will be in the Groups favour.
v A rbitration proceedings by Lion Petroleum in respect of Block 1, Kenya.
See note 5.16 for more details.
vi A s described in note 5.9 b Afren was notified that Earl Act expected the put and call option over FHN shares to also cover an additional tranche of 13,780,008 FHN shares currently held by an affiliate of Earl Act, which would have amounted to an additional US$45.7 million in excess of the liability recorded for the put and call option.
As described in note 5.16 post period end Afren has reached an agreement to purchase these shares at a price of US$2.80 per share and the resulting consideration of US$38.6 million will be payable in 10 equal instalments commencing 30 June 2017.
As announced on 13 October 2014, as a result of an independent investigation by WFG, the Company notified the UKLA of two breaches of its Listing Rules obligations in respect of two transactions which occurred in 2012 and 2013.
In addition, as announced on 20 March 2015, Afren has notified the Serious Fraud Office of preliminary concerns regarding certain matters of potential noncompliance with laws and regulations.
Regulatory bodies have the power to levy fines and penalties for non-compliance with laws and regulations.
However, to date, no fines or penalties, nor any other potential censure, have been communicated to the Company in relation to these matters, and the Directors conclude it is impossible to quantify any potential exposure in respect of such matters.
The Directors have undertaken an assessment of existing guarantees and commitments which relate to the Groups exploration and evaluation licences, and in particular those that have been impaired, and are satisfied that the risk of any further liability is remote.
This assessment included additional guarantees and commitments which are not listed above.
Certain other contingent liabilities arising subsequent to the balance sheet date are disclosed in note 5.16.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 135 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 5.0 Other disclosures This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.
In our view, these disclosures are less important and or material to the core operations of Afren, or other one-off events, and as such they have been grouped in Section 5.
5.1 Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for accounting periods that end 31 December 2014: Amendments to IAS 32 on offsetting financial assets and liabilities As the Group does not have any financial assets and financial liabilities that qualify for offset, the adoption of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 on recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 39 on the novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting As the Group does not have any derivatives that are subject to novation, the adoption of these amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but are not yet effective and have yet to be adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments and IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 until a detailed review has been completed.
5.2 Audit and non-audit fees 2014 2013 US$m US$m An analysis of auditors remuneration is as follows: Fees payable to the Companys auditor for the audit of the Companys financial statements 0.9 0.5 Fees payable to the Companys auditor and their associates for other services to the Group: The audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.6 0.5 Total audit fees 1.5 1.0 Audit-related assurance services 0.4 0.3 Taxation compliance services Other taxation advisory services 0.1 Corporate finance services 0.9 Total non-audit fees 0.5 1.2 Audit-related assurance services in 2014 and 2013 include the auditors reviews of the Groups interim and quarterly reporting.
Fees paid to Deloitte for audit and other services provided to the Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as the Group accounts are required to discuss such fees on a consolidated basis.
During 2013, external auditors performed a significant amount of non-audit work on projects such as the acquisition of a beneficial interest of 10.4% in FHN and the issuing of Senior Secured Notes.
This is work external auditors would ordinarily perform for companies involved in such projects.
5.3 Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives The Group monitors and manages the financial risks relating to its operations through internal risk reports which analyse exposure by type and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Board of Directors agrees and reviews policies for managing each of these risks.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty most commonly a customer will default on its contractual obligations for example default on invoice payment resulting in financial loss to the Group.
136 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Groups sales are diversified in terms of the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil companies with high credit ratings and balances due from its Partners, the Group does not have significant exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or with governmental guarantee.
The credit risk on advances to Partners is limited as the amounts due can be recouped through operating the assets of the arrangement.
The Groups total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2014 was US$495.6 million 2013: US$545.8 million, made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables excluding prepayments.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built a liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
Important additional information relating to the Groups funding and liquidity status is included in the Directors report on page 76.
5.4 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
When there is evidence that a receivable is not recoverable, it is impaired with a corresponding charge to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables includes underlift amounts refer to note 4.6 Inventories for further details.
Prepayments and advances to Partners are generally interest-free.
These amounts are recognised initially at the present value of all future cash receipts, discounted using the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar instrument with a similar credit rating.
No trade or other receivable items bear interest.
2014 2013 US$m US$m Trade and other receivables current Trade and other debtors 190.7 141.6 Prepayments and accrued income 31.1 68.0 221.8 209.6 Prepayments and advances to Partners 64.0 99.3 285.8 308.9 The amount shown is net of a provision for doubtful debts of US$20.6 million 2013: US$12.2 million.
There were no material receivables which were past due but not impaired at either balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2013 advances to Partners represented the amortised cost of a US$100.0 million loan to Oriental in relation to the Ebok field which Afren recovered in full during 2014.
The balance as at 31 December 2014 relates to a further Partner advance.
5.5 Trade and other payables Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.
Trade creditors includes overlift amounts refer to note 4.6 Inventories for further details.
Where settlement of net profit interest liabilities occurs via the delivery of barrels of oil, rather than cash, this is accounted for as a reduction to the outstanding creditors balance and a corresponding credit to cost of sales.

5.6 Fair values The financial instruments on the Afren balance sheet are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The following table provides an analysis of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade creditors, other creditors, finance leases and accruals and deferred consideration and payables on acquisitions have been excluded from this analysis as their fair values are equal to the carrying values.
The financial instruments in the table are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the inputs used to calculate the fair value are observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

The fair value was calculated based on the expected timing of repayments and using a discount rate of 2%.
The balance at 31 12 14 relates to a further Partner advance.
As this is expected to be recovered in less than 12 months no discounting has been included in the calculation of the fair value.
ii F HN options: The valuation of these options requires assumptions regarding FHNs share price which is not based on observable market data.
These options were therefore valued using a Black-Scholes model for which changing certain inputs to reflect reasonable possible alternative assumptions does not change fair value significantly.
iii Bank borrowings: Fair values have been determined by reference to LIBOR forward curves and by discounting future cash outflows at 10%.
There have been no transfers between levels in the period.
The FHN options are classified at Level 3.
As such, their valuation requires assumptions regarding FHNs share price which are not readily available.
These options were valued using a Black Scholes model inputs used are detailed below.
Changing certain inputs to reasonable possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.

If interest rates had been 1% higher and all other variables held constant, the Groups interest payable for the year ended 31 December 2014 would increase by US$3.1 million 2013: US$2.3 million, a portion of which would be capitalised to assets.
Oil price risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in oil price relates primarily to the Groups derivative financial instruments.
In 2013, the terms of the derivative financial instruments were such that the Group received a minimum amount if the market fell, but received a set discount from the market price if the oil price was above that minimum.
The effect on Group result and equity of changes in the oil price on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments is as follows: Positive adverse 2014 Positive adverse 2013 US$m US$m Increase in oil price by 10% 2.9 Decrease in oil price by 10% 6.2 As per note 3.3, there were no open hedge positions at the end of 2014.
Foreign exchange risk The impact of a 10% change in the sterling or the Nigerian Naira to US dollar exchange rate was not material in 2014 or 2013.
5.8 Staff costs 2014 2013 The average monthly number of employees including Executive Directors was as follows: Administration 30 36 Professional 285 258 315 294 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Wages and salaries 56.5 59.0 Share-based payments a 9.2 25.2 Social security costs 1.7 8.5 Pension costs b 4.0 3.5 68.0 96.2 A proportion of the Groups staff costs shown above are recharged to the Groups joint venture partners and a proportion is capitalised into the cost of intangible and tangible oil and gas assets under the Groups accounting policy for exploration, evaluation and oil and gas assets.
The amount ultimately remaining in the income statement was US$9.9 million 2013: US$16.7 million.
Details of Directors remuneration are provided in the part of the Directors remuneration report described as having been audited.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 139 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 a Share-based payments A transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment where the Group receives services from employees, Directors or third parties and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Directors.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period to exercise, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for employers National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price.
This expense is accrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments made to employees of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant subsidiary when awarded.
The share-based payments expense comprises the following two schemes: 2014 2013 US$m US$m Equity-settled share option scheme i 0.6 12.6 Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share ii 8.6 12.6 award scheme 9.2 25.2 i Equity-settled share option scheme The Group operates a share option scheme for employees.
The Groups policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter.
Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting periods of up to three years.
The options expire after 10 years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2014 2013 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of the year 49,403,834 0.85 55,209,834 0.82 Granted during the year 505,000 1.48 2,040,000 1.41 Exercised during the year 1,986,000 0.80 6,416,000 0.63 Forfeited during the year 20,585,667 0.71 1,430,000 1.38 27,337,167 0.96 49,403,834 0.85 Exercisable at end of the year 23,642,167 0.91 43,066,334 0.78 The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2014 was 4.6 years 2013: 5.3 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2014 was 80p 2013: 148p.
In 2014, options were granted on 1 January, 1 April and 1 July.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$0.4 million.
In 2013, options were granted on 3, 8, 15 January, 27 March, 11 and 18 June, 28 August, 4 and 24 September and 1 October.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year.
The inputs into the Barrier model were as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted average share price pence 147.9 141.9 Weighted average exercise price pence 147.9 141.9 Weighted average target price before eligibility to exercise barrier pence 207.0 198.5 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk-free rate 4% 4% Expected dividends 140 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, and over several time periods.
These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which was in line with the prior year up until when the 2014 options were granted in June 2014.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options in 2014 of US$0.6 million 2013: US$1.0 million, all of which related to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share award scheme Under the Afren Performance Share Plan, the Group also gives awards to Directors and staff subject to outperforming a comparator group of similarly focused oil and gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period and based upon a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three-year period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies, which for the 2014 award was as follows: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Cairn Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, DNO, Dragon Oil, Enquest, Genel Energy, Gulfsands Petroleum, Hess Corporation, JKX Oil & Gas, Lundin Petroleum, Marathon Oil Corporation, Maurel et Prom, Niko Resources, Noble Energy, PA Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources, Premier Oil, Salamander Energy, Seplat, SOCO International, Talisman Energy, Tullow Oil, Vaalco Energy and Woodside Petroleum.
If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, no shares will be awarded.
At the median level, 25% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest.
A second performance target relates to the Groups Reserves Replacement Ratio RRR, setting a target RRR of 105% over the three-year vesting period of the awards.
In the event that a ratio of less than 105% is achieved then the overall award amount is reduced pro-rata.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances, e. g. redundancies, where the number of awards vesting will be pro-rated according to the length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.
Details of the share awards outstanding are as follows: 2014 2013 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of the year 33,904,155 0.01 27,704,588 0.01 Granted during the year 11,934,281 0.01 13,512,561 0.01 Exercised during the year 7,306,401 0.01 4,188,209 0.01 Forfeited during the year 9,365,503 0.01 3,124,785 0.01 Outstanding at end of the year 29,166,532 0.01 33,904,155 0.01 Exercisable at end of the year 0.01 0.01 The awards outstanding at the end of 31 December 2014 have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years 2013:1.7years and an exercise price of 0.01 2013: 0.01.
The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during the year ended 31 December 2014 was US$4.6 million 2013:US$13.1million.
The fair values were calculated using a stochastic model.
The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during the two periods were as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted average share price pence 140.7 123.6 Weighted average exercise price pence 0.0 0.0 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3.0 3.0 Risk-free rate Expected dividends Following the review of the volatility of Afren shares, as described in note 5.8 a i, the volatility assumption has remained the same and will remain under review going forwards.
The Group recognised total expenses related to the above equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options during the year ended 31 December 2014 of US$8.6 million 2013: US$12.6 million.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 141 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 b Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution plan are recognised as staffcosts and are expensed to the income statement in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.
As at 31 December 2014, pension costs amounting to US$0.3 million 2013: US$0.1 million were not yet paid over to the scheme administrator.

b Put option over own equity During 2013, one option expired and one was exercised as part of Afrens increase in equity ownership of FHN.
In 2013, Afren entered into a put and call agreement with Earl Act Global Investments Earl Act in respect of 18,219,992 million FHN shares, representing approximately 12.5% of FHN share capital, at a price of US$3.32 per share.
These options may only be exercised after 24 months and for a period of six months thereafter.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the options are accounted for as options over own equity, whereby a liability for the present value of the obligation is recognised within other financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge in other equity.
Afren received notification that Earl Act expected the put and call option to also cover an additional tranche of 13,780,008 FHN shares currently held by an affiliate of Earl Act, which at the option price of US$3.32 would amount to an additional US$45.7 million.
These shares are those previously held by current and previous members of the Afren plc Board and senior management, and were disposed of during 2013.
The Directors are of the opinion that at the time of their disposal and at 31 December 2014, there was no arrangement between Afren, Earl Act, the affiliate of Earl Act or the current and previous members of the Afren plc Board as to any obligation to acquire such shares at a future date.
As described in note 5.16, on 31 March 2015 Afren reached an agreement with Earl Act to restructure the put and call option.
c Convertible loan note In July 2013, the Group redeemed the convertible loan note in full.
d Hedging reserve In December 2014, the Group closed out its commodity deferred put options.

FHN has a 45% interest in the OML 26 licence onshore Nigeria and a 9% interest in OML 113 offshore Nigeria, via its own subsidiaries.
During 2013, Afren increased its beneficial interest in FHN from approximately 46.7% to 78%.
As at 31 December 2014, 22% 2013: 22% of FHN was owned by non-controlling shareholders.
The analysis above shows the effect of the change in ownership on the equity attributable to the non-controlling interest in FHN.
5.11 Related party transactions The transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Amounts owed by and to joint ventures and associates are disclosed in notes 6.6 and 6.8 of the Company financial statements.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been disclosed in note 6.15 of the Company financial statements.
Trading transactions During the year, Group companies entered into the following transactions with related parties: Sale of goods services Purchase of goods services Amounts owed to related parties Year ended 2014 Year ended 2013 Year ended 2014 Year ended 2013 Year ended 2014 Year ended 2013 US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m St. John Advisors Ltd 0.2 0.3 STJ Advisors LLP 0.2 Other related parties 0.3 0.3 St. John Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisors LLP are the contractor companies for the consulting services of John St. John, a Non-Executive Director of Afren, for which they receive fees, including contingent completion and success fees, from the Group.
St. John Advisors also received a monthly retainer of 15,000 under a contract which started from 27 June 2008.
The contract was terminated in May 2014.
Other related parties include two individuals who served on Afrens Board of Directors during the year who each had a close family member employed by the Group.
These individuals were employed at market rates and received compensation totalling US$0.1 million and US$0.1 million 2013: US$0.2 million and US$ nil under the terms of their contracts of employment.
In addition, a close family member of a member of key management personnel was employed by the Group during the year at market rates and received compensation totalling US$0.1 million 2013: US$0.1 million under the terms of their contract of employment.
On 13 October 2014, the Company announced the results of an independent review undertaken by Willkie, Farr and Gallagher into disclosure around previous transactions and unauthorised payments.
Within this announcement it was explained that evidence had emerged to suggest that, in relation to a US$100.0 million settlement paid by the Group to Amni International Petroleum Development Company Limited Amni in December 2013, Osman Shahenshah and Shahid Ullah both of whom were Directors of Afren plc at the time of the payment intended to obtain a personal benefit from the transaction.
The personal benefit was considered most likely to take the form of the acquisition of equity in the company which was incorporated to acquire Amni as part of a management buy-out.
Both Osman Shahenshah and Shahid Ullah denied that they obtained any benefit from this transaction and no conclusive evidence has emerged that would indicate they had ownership of any Amni shares.
Amni is therefore not considered to be a related party and has not been disclosed as such.
Tzell Travel Group Tzell has been utilised by Afren for some of its travel needs, an employee of which is a close family member of Osman Shahenshah.
The Company does not believe Tzell should be considered a related party.
Afren uses several travel agents as there is a significant travel element to its operations.
Transactions totalling US$0.1 million 2013: US$0.4 million were entered into with Tzell during the year, upon which commission of approximately US$40 per transaction was paid by Afren to Tzell, the balance being direct costs for air fares and hotel accommodation.
As at 31 December 2014, no amounts were outstanding 2013: US$nil.
No further transactions are expected with Tzell.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 143 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 Details are provided in note 5.9 b of an additional tranche of FHN shares disposed of by current and former members of the Afren plc Board and senior management in 2013 and a put option and call option over FHN shares between Afren and Earl Act.
As a result, for the reasons described in note 5.9 b Afren believes there was no related party transaction to be disclosed in respect of this additional tranche of FHN shares.
5.12 Remuneration of key management personnel The remuneration of the Directors and Associate Directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.

Following a change in production profile, combined with a sharp decline in forecast oil price, an impairment test has been performed which has resulted in the carrying value of goodwill being impaired in full.
The recoverable amount of the CGU as at 31 December 2014 of US$189.1 million has been determined on a fair value less costs of disposal basis, using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates cash flows to 2050.
In calculating discounted cash flows, management has made the following key assumptions: Production volumes: Estimates are based on detailed independent forecasts for the field and take into account the development plan agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process: Discount rate: A 10% real post-tax discount rate has been used which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
The fair value estimate, which includes future capital spend and other input assumptions not derived from an observable market, is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement, see note 5.6 for explanation.
5.14 Discontinued operations On 16 May 2013, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Afren Cote dIvoire Limited and Lion GPL SA, which held Afrens interest in the CI-11 Block and Lion Gas Plant respectively.
The disposal was completed on 31 August 2013, on which date control of these two entities passed to the acquirer.
A profit on disposal of US$25.3 million was recognised in the prior year.

This reflects a change in judgement as to how the consideration of US$300.0 million paid in the transaction should be split between tax and oil entitlement benefits acquired, with the corresponding effect being cost of sales.
Further detail is provided in note 1.6.
Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 145 Notes to the Group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 5.16 Post balance sheet events Company and Group On 12 January 2015, Afren plc announced an update in relation to Barda Rash, a field in the Kurdistan region of Iraq in which it owns a 60% working interest via a wholly owned subsidiary.
The announcement stated that an updated Competent Persons Report was expected to show a material reduction to previously published estimates of reserves and resources which would essentially eliminate gross proven and probable reserves of 190 mmbbls.
This has been fully reflected within the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
A divestment of these assets is expected to complete within the next 12 months.
On 26 January 2015, Afren Resources Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Afren plc, received a letter from the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission informing that the initial tax holiday in relation to the Ebok field had been reduced from five to three years.
If enforced, the tax holiday would have effectively ceased on 31 May 2014 although two further annual periods of extension can be applied for.
Afren intends to contest the reduction and apply for the two-year extension as necessary.
If it is the case that neither of these actions is successful, the income tax credit would decrease by US$87.1 million a sum of additional current income tax and a reduction in deferred tax from US$303.9 million to US$216.8 million with a corresponding US$3.6 million increase in current income tax payable from US$15.7 million to US$19.3 million as at 31 December 2014, and a decrease in deferred tax asset from US$348.2 million to US$264.7 million as at 31 December 2014.
On 20 February 2015, the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN released a circular TED FEM FPC GEN 01 006 restricting access to funds in Export Proceeds Domiciliary Accounts.
In compliance with the directive, Afrens operational practices including cash management, vendor payments, and fulfilment of other statutory financial obligations have been adversely affected.
Several trade and industry groups are actively engaging the CBN and it is anticipated that a resolution may be achieved in the upcoming months.
On 13 March 2015, Afren plc announced an agreement in principle to address its short and longer-term funding needs and recapitalise its capital structure.
More details are provided in note 1 to the financial statements and the going concern section of the Directors report.
Since the announcement of the review of the Groups capital structure and funding requirements, Afren has received a number of claims for breaches of contract for non-payment of amounts due for services provided and or the termination of services contracts.
These claims have arisen in part due to the liquidity constraints facing the Group, as well as actions taken to reduce costs in line with the revised focus on the Groups core producing assets.
Such claims include: Notices of claim for US$10.25 million and US$93.89 million by West African Ventures against Afren Exploration and Production Nigeria Alpha Limited and Afren Energy Resources Limited, respectively, for termination and cancellation fees, costs, losses and expenses allegedly due following the termination of oil services contracts with WAV relating to Okwok and Okoro: An alleged default notice and purported termination notice served by Amni in respect of the PSTSA arising in respect of the termination of the WAV contract for Okoro.
The PSTSA is the primary legal agreement through which the Group derives its entitlement benefits and reserves of the Okoro field: Arbitration proceedings by Lion Petroleum for US$10.0 million in damages in respect of alleged breaches of the Joint Operating Agreement signed between East African Exploration Kenya Limited and Lion Petroleum in respect of Block 1, Kenya.
The Company disputes and or has rejected such claims and is in discussions with the relevant claimants regarding potential settlements and or withdrawal of such claims.
A contingent liability has been disclosed in note 4.8 in respect of the Lion Petroleum claim, no other provisions or contingent liabilities have been recorded or disclosed in the 2014 financial statements.
On 15 April 2015 the Group signed an agreement with Earl-Act Global Investments Limited EAG and CSL Trustees Limited CSL, an affiliate of EAG, to acquire the 22% of shares in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company Limited FHN that the Group does not currently own.
Afren has amended the terms of the put call option with EAG announced on 5 July 2013 in respect of 18,299,993 shares in FHN to be acquired at US$3.32 per share and has also agreed to purchase the 13,780,008 FHN shares owned by CSL at US$2.80 per share.
In each case such shares will now be acquired and the purchase price will be payable in equal quarterly instalments from 30 June 2017 to 30 September 2019 together with annual interest of LIBOR 6.5% payable in cash and 2.5% payable in kind payable in respect of the purchase price.

146 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report of Corporate Accounts report the Directors governance On 30 April 2015, Afren Resources Limited ARL and its Partner on the Ebok field, Oriental, signed a settlement agreement in respect of Ebok and Okwok.
As part of these arrangements, Afren has agreed to transfer to Oriental amounts recovered excluding those which compensate for legal fees Afren has incurred from former Directors and officers of the Company in relation to the unauthorised payments issue.
A liability for these amounts has been recorded in the 2014 financial statements.
Afren has also agreed with our Partner, Oriental, that they will fund their share of Capex in Ebok.
Going forward this will result in a lower share of production following the end of all cost recovery.
In addition Afren has agreed with Oriental that in order to retain its participation in the Okwok licence it will decide by the end of June 2015 on the further development plan and commit to the funding of the field, following completion of the recent development well and a review of the optimum development plan.
The carrying value of Okwok at 31 December 2014 is US$200.2 million.
Similarly the Group has agreed that in order to retain its participation in the OML 115 licence, it will decide by the end of 2015 to commit to a development plan.
The carrying value of OML115 at 31 December 2014 is US$82.4 million.
The Okwok licence expired in March 2015, however, the partners expect that the licence will be renewed on the basis that they have made sufficient progress in the development of the asset.
In respect of the Ebok licence, the Group is entitled to an extension for the lifespan of the field, which is in progress following expiry of the current term in March 2015.
On 30 April 2015, following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent, Afren and certain holders of its Existing Notes entered into a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of the PPNs to provide $200 million in net interim funding.
As announced on 13 March 2015, Afren has also agreed in principle the terms of a financial and capital restructuring which is expected to be completed by the end of July 2015 providing a further US$55 million to US$105 million.
In relation to the interim funding, Afren will receive US$200m from the issue of US$212 million Private Placement Notes PPNs at a discount of 5.5%.
The PPNs will have an annual interest rate of 15% payable in kind and will mature no later than April 2016.
The proposed restructuring plan includes the issuance of high yield notes, a debt-for-equity swap, an open offer of new shares to all shareholders and an amendment to the Ebok loan facility.
If the Companys shareholders approve the restructuring plan, on completion US$206.6 million of the PPNs will be redeemed in cash at par plus accrued interest and US$5 million of the PPNs will be converted into ordinary shares representing 5% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company post recapitalisation.
If the Companys shareholders reject the restructuring proposals, the PPNs will be repaid at par plus accrued interest on the completion of an alternative restructuring plan or the maturity date.
