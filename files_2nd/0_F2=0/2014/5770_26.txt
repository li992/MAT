110 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 1.
Corporate information Experian plc the Company, the ultimate parent company of the Experian group of companies Experian or the Group, is incorporated and registered in Jersey as a public company limited by shares and is resident in Ireland.
The Companys registered office is at 22 Grenville Street, St Helier, Jersey JE4 8PX.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchanges Regulated Market Premium Listing.
Experian is the leading global information services group.
There has been no change in this information since the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Basis of preparation These financial statements are: prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS or IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union the EU and IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations together EU-IFRS : prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified for the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and certain other financial assets and financial liabilities including derivatives: presented in US dollars, the most representative currency of the Groups operations, and generally rounded to the nearest million: prepared using the principal exchange rates set out in note 10: and designed to include disclosures to comply with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The use of critical accounting estimates and management judgment is required in applying the accounting policies.
Areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements, are highlighted in note 6.
The Companys own financial statements are again prepared under UK accounting standards and set out on pages 164 to 169.
Changes in accounting standards Accounting standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2014 which had a material impact on these financial statements are detailed below.
a Amendment to IAS 1 Financial statements presentation In accordance with this amendment, amounts reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income are now grouped to separately report items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss and items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.
Comparative figures have been re-presented in the appropriate grouping.
b IAS 19 revised Employee benefits Experian adopted IAS 19 revised with effect from 1 April 2013.
This revision requires the use of the discount rate to determine both the interest income on pension assets and the interest expense on post-employment benefit obligations.
The resulting net interest is reported within interest income or expense as appropriate.
Pension plan administration costs are now required to be reported within operating profit rather than as a deduction from the return on pension assets.
Comparative figures have been re-presented accordingly.
The effect is to reduce Profit before tax and Benchmark profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2013 by US$6m.
Operating profit is reduced by pension plan administration costs of US$2m, recognised in the Central Activities segment, and net finance costs are increased by US$4m.
Remeasurement losses on post-employment benefit assets and obligations recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income have been reduced by US$5m, including a tax effect of US$1m.
There is no effect on the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2013 nor on amounts in the Group cash flow statement for the year then ended.
c Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures Experian has provided the additional disclosures required within these financial statements.
d IFRS 13 Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for all fair value measurements but its application has not materially affected the Groups fair value measurements.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 13, Experian has applied the new fair value measurement guidance prospectively.
Additional disclosures required by IFRS 13 are included in notes 29 and 30.
Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 111 4.
Recent accounting developments The information below is a summary of other external accounting developments, none of which is currently expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
We routinely review such developments and adapt our financial reporting systems as appropriate.
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for the first time for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2014: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 Transition guidance: IAS 27 revised Separate financial statements: IAS 28 revised Associate and joint ventures: Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments amendment on financial assets and liability offsetting: Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets: and Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2014 there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective, including IFRS 9 Financial instruments which is being issued in phases.
Until IFRS 9 is finalised, its full requirements remain uncertain and it is not currently possible to assess the impact of its adoption on the Group.
There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied are summarised below.
They have been consistently applied to both years presented.
In the interests of brevity and clarity, the explanations of these policies now focus on areas where judgment is applied or which are particularly important in the financial statements.
The inclusion of content from accounting standards, amendments and interpretations has been largely discontinued for items where there is simply no policy choice under EU-IFRS.
For ease of reference, the content within this note is arranged as follows: sections a to d content of general applicability in the preparation of these financial statements: sections e to o balance sheet policies to be read in conjunction with specific notes as indicated: sections p to w income statement policies to be read in conjunction with specific notes as indicated: and section x the policy and presentation principles adopted for the disclosure of segment information in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
a Basis of consolidation Experian follows EU-IFRS including: IFRS 3 Business combinations: IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations: and IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries and segments used for consolidation purposes are consistent with Group policies.
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2014.
A list of the significant subsidiaries is given in note O to the parent company financial statements.
b Foreign currency translation Experian follows EU-IFRS, including IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
112 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 5.
Significant accounting policies continued c Fair value estimation Experian follows EU-IFRS including IFRS 13 Fair value measurement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are determined by using market data and established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is based on a comparison of the contractual and year end exchange rates.
The fair values of other derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
d Impairment of non-financial assets Experian follows EU-IFRS, including IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
Assets that are not subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment charge is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell, and value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into cash generating units CGUs, determined by the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
e Goodwill note 20 Experian follows EU-IFRS, including IAS 38 Intangible assets.
f Other intangible assets note 21 Experian follows EU-IFRS, including IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Acquisition intangibles Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised on acquisition at fair value separately from goodwill, if those assets are identifiable, separable or arise from legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably.
Such assets are referred to as acquisition intangibles in these financial statements.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows: Customer and other relationships over three to 18 years, based on managements estimates of the average lives of such relationships: and Acquired software development over three to eight years, based on the expected life of the asset.
Marketing-related assets: Trademarks and licences over their contractual lives up to a maximum period of 20 years: and Trade names over three to 14 years, based on managements expected retention of trade names within the business.
Other intangibles Other intangibles are capitalised at cost, in accordance with IAS 38.
Capitalisation and amortisation policies are: Databases capitalised databases, which comprise the data purchase and data capture costs of internally developed databases, are amortised over three to seven years.
Computer software internal use software computer software licences purchased for internal use are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to purchase and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over three to ten years.
Computer software internally generated software costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
g Property, plant and equipment note 22 Items of property, plant and equipment are held at cost less accumulated depreciation, in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows: Freehold properties over 50 years: Short leasehold properties over the remaining period of the lease: Finance leases over the lower of the useful life of the equipment and period of the lease: and Other plant and equipment over three to ten years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Technology-based assets are typically depreciated over three to five years with other infrastructure assets depreciated over five to ten years.
Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 113 h Trade receivables note 23 Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at this value less any provision for impairment.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Such evidence is based primarily on the pattern of cash received, compared to the terms upon which the receivable is contracted.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the value of estimated future cash flows.
Any charges or credits in respect of such provisions and irrecoverable trade receivables are recognised in the Group income statement within other operating charges.
i Cash and cash equivalents note 24 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, term and call deposits held with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group balance sheet.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are reported net of bank overdrafts.
j Financial assets notes 28 and 29 As required by IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures, the Group classifies its financial assets in the four categories set out below.
Loans and receivables comprising trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Derivatives used for hedging including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity swaps.
Assets at fair value through profit and loss comprising non-hedging derivative financial instruments.
Available-for-sale financial assets being non-derivative financial assets either designated to this category or not classified in the other financial asset categories.
k Derivative financial instruments note 29 The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain obligations relating to share incentive plans, including social security obligations.
Instruments used include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, foreign exchange contracts and equity swaps.
These are recognised as assets or liabilities as appropriate and are classified as non-current unless they mature within one year of the balance sheet date.
Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date a contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedging derivatives The Group designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges, being hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or a firm commitment.
The Group does not currently enter into cash flow or net investment hedges.
The Group documents both the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
This effectiveness testing is performed at every reporting date throughout the life of the hedge to confirm that the hedge remains, and will continue to remain, highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recognised in the Group income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The ineffective portion of a fair value hedge is recognised in net finance costs in the Group income statement.
Non-hedging derivatives Changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Cost and income amounts in respect of derivatives entered into in connection with social security obligations on employee share incentive plans, other than amounts of a financing nature, are charged or credited within labour costs.
Other costs and changes in the fair value of such derivatives are charged or credited within financing fair value remeasurements in the Group income statement.
114 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 5.
Significant accounting policies continued l Borrowings note 26 Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of any transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Borrowings are classified as non-current to the extent that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date.
m Trade payables note 25 Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Where the time value of money is material, payables are then carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
n Post-employment benefit assets and obligations note 34 Defined benefit pension arrangements funded plans The post-employment benefit assets and obligations recognised in the Group balance sheet in respect of funded plans comprise the fair value of plan assets of funded plans less the present value of the related defined benefit obligation at that date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Under this method, and in view of the fact that the principal Experian funded plan is closed to new entrants, the current service cost increases as members approach retirement due to the plans ageing active membership.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, using market yields on high-quality corporate sterling bonds with maturity terms consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement comprises the cost of benefits accrued and interest on the opening net defined benefit asset or obligation.
Service costs and the net financing income or expense are recognised separately in the Group income statement.
Plan expenses are charged within labour costs.
Defined benefit pension arrangements unfunded plans Unfunded pension obligations are determined and accounted for in accordance with the principles used in respect of the funded arrangements.
Defined contribution pension arrangements The assets of defined contribution plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension cost recognised in the Group income statement represents the contributions payable by the Group to these funds in respect of the year.
Post-retirement healthcare obligations Obligations in respect of post-retirement healthcare plans are calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries using an actuarial methodology similar to that for the funded defined benefit pension arrangements.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The cost recognised in the Group income statement only comprises interest on the obligation.
o Own shares note 38 Shares in the Company purchased in connection with any share buyback programme, and held as treasury shares, are shown as a deduction from total equity at cost.
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans and, in this connection, shares in the Company are held by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan.
The assets of these entities mainly comprise Experian shares, which are also shown as a deduction from total equity at cost.
p Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable on the provision of services, net of value added tax and other sales taxes, rebates and discounts.
Revenue includes the provision and processing of data, subscriptions to services, software and database customisation and development and the sale of software licences, maintenance and related consulting services.
Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 115 Revenue in respect of the provision and processing of data is recognised in the year in which the service is provided.
Subscription revenues, and revenues in respect of services to be provided by an indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, are recognised on a straight-line basis over those periods.
Customisation, development and consulting revenues are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the work which is generally on the basis of costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total costs.
Revenue from software licences is recognised upon delivery.
Revenue from maintenance agreements is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the maintenance period.
Where a single arrangement comprises a number of individual elements which are capable of operating independently of one another, the total revenues are allocated amongst the individual elements based on an estimate of the fair value of each element.
Where the elements are not capable of operating independently, or reasonable measures of fair value for each element are not available, total revenues are recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period to reflect the timing of services performed.
Sales are generally invoiced in the geographic area in which the customer is located and accordingly the geographic location of the invoicing company is used as the basis for attributing revenue to individual countries.
q Operating charges Operating charges are reported by nature in the Group income statement, reflecting the Groups cost-management control structure.
Details of charges in respect of share incentive plans within labour costs are set out in note t below.
Those for post-employment benefits are set out in note n above.
Details of the Groups amortisation and depreciation policy are given in notes f and g above.
The principles upon which impairment charges are recognised are set out in note d above.
Payments made under operating leases are charged in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the lease period.
r Net finance costs note 15 Incremental transaction costs which are directly attributable to the issue of debt are capitalised and amortised over the expected life of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method.
All other borrowing costs are charged in the Group income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are taken to net finance costs over the periods of the contracts, together with the interest differentials reflected in foreign exchange contracts.
Details of the nature of movements in the fair value of derivatives which are reported as financing fair value remeasurements are included in note k above.
The change in the year in the net present value of put call option agreements in place, in respect of shares held by non-controlling shareholders, is recognised as a financial fair value remeasurement within net finance costs.
s Tax note 16 The tax charge or credit for the year is recognised in the Group income statement, except for tax on items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In such cases the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.
Current income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax that arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences, to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where they relate to the same tax authority.
116 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 5.
Significant accounting policies continued t Share incentive plans note 32 The fair value of share incentives granted in connection with the Groups equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using whichever of the BlackScholes model, Monte Carlo model or closing market price is most appropriate.
The Group takes into account the best estimate of the number of awards and options expected to vest and such estimates are revised at each balance sheet date.
Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.
Market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement but are not revised for actual performance.
u Contingent consideration Contingent consideration is recognised in accordance with EU-IFRS, including IFRS 3. v Discontinued operations note 17 Discontinued operations are reported in accordance with EU-IFRS, including IFRS 5. w Earnings per share note 18 Earnings per share are reported in accordance with EU-IFRS, including IAS 33. x Segment information policy and presentation principles note 9 Experian is organised into, and managed on a worldwide basis through, the following five operating segments, which are based on geographic areas and supported by central functions: North America: Latin America: UK and Ireland: Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA : and Asia Pacific.
The chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of these operating segments on the basis of EBIT, as defined in note 7.
The All other segments category required to be disclosed has been captioned as EMEA Asia Pacific in these financial statements.
This combines information in respect of the EMEA and Asia Pacific segments as neither of these operating segments is individually reportable, on the basis of their share of the Groups results and net assets.
Experian separately presents information equivalent to segment disclosures in respect of the costs of its central functions under the caption of Central Activities, as management believes that this information is helpful to users of the financial statements.
Costs reported for Central Activities include costs arising from finance, treasury and other global functions.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.
Inter-segment transactions have no material impact on the Groups results.
Segment assets exclude tax assets, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives designated as hedges of borrowings.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities, borrowings and related hedging derivatives.
Net assets reported for Central Activities comprise corporate head office assets and liabilities, including certain post-employment benefit assets and obligations and derivative assets and liabilities.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, other than additions through business combinations.
Information required to be presented additionally includes analysis of the Groups revenues over groups of service lines.
This is supplemented by voluntary disclosure of the profitability of those groups of service lines.
For ease of reference, Experian continues to use the term business segments when discussing the results of groups of service lines.
Experians four business segments, details of which are given in the separate Strategic report section of this annual report, are: Credit Services: Decision Analytics: Marketing Services: and Consumer Services.
The North America and the UK and Ireland operating segments derive revenues from all of the Groups business segments.
The EMEA and Asia Pacific segments currently do not derive revenue from the Consumer Services business segment and such revenue generated in the Latin America segment is not yet sufficiently material to be disclosed separately.
Reportable segment information for the full year provided to the chief operating decision maker is set out in note 9 a.
Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 117 6.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments a Critical accounting estimates and assumptions In preparing the Group financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on managements best judgment at the date of the Group financial statements, will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are summarised below.
Commentary on share incentive plans and pension benefits, which was included in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2013, no longer features as management no longer considers these to be areas of critical accounting estimates or judgment.
Revenue recognition is again excluded from this summary on the grounds that the policy adopted in this area is sufficiently objective.
Tax note 16 The Group is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining the related assets or provisions as there are transactions in the ordinary course of business and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional tax will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, the differences will affect the results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax assets or provisions in the year in which such determination is made.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets based on forecasts of future profits against which those assets may be utilised.
Goodwill note 20 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is generally determined on the basis of value-in-use calculations, which require the use of cash flow projections based on approved financial budgets, looking forward up to five years.
Management determines budgeted profit margin based on past performance and its expectations for the markets development.
Cash ows are extrapolated using estimated growth rates beyond a five-year period.
The growth rates used do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the markets in which the CGU operates.
The discount rates used reflect the CGUs pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments note 29 The fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and makes assumptions, or uses observable market-based inputs, that are mainly based on market conditions at each balance sheet date.
b Critical judgments In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group financial statements.
These judgments include the classification of transactions between the Group income statement and the Group balance sheet.
The most significant of these judgments are in respect of intangible assets and contingencies: Intangible assets Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets if a number of criteria are met.
Management has made judgments and assumptions when assessing whether a project meets these criteria, and on measuring the costs and the economic life attributed to such projects.
On acquisition, specific intangible assets are identified and recognised separately from goodwill and then amortised over their estimated useful lives.
These include items such as brand names and customer lists, to which value is first attributed at the time of acquisition.
The capitalisation of these assets and the related amortisation charges are based on judgments about the value and economic life of such items.
The economic lives for intangible assets are estimated at between three and ten years for internal projects, which include databases, internal use software and internally generated software, and between two and 20 years for acquisition intangibles.
Further details of the amounts of, and movements in, such assets are given in note 21.
Contingencies In the case of pending and threatened litigation claims, management has formed a judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate liability.
No liability has been recognised where the likelihood of any loss arising is possible rather than probable.
118 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 7.
Use of non-GAAP measures in the Group financial statements As detailed below, the Group has identified and defined certain measures that it believes assist understanding of Experians performance.
The measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has included them as they consider them to be key measures used within the business to assess performance.
a Benchmark profit before tax Benchmark PBT Benchmark PBT is defined as profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles, impairment of goodwill, acquisition expenses, adjustments to contingent consideration, exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements, tax and discontinued operations.
It includes the Groups share of continuing associates pre-tax results.
An explanation of the basis on which Experian reports exceptional items is provided below.
Other adjustments made to derive Benchmark PBT can be explained as follows: The Group has excluded charges for the amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles from its definition of Benchmark PBT because such charges are based on judgments about their value and economic life.
Impairment of goodwill is similarly excluded from the definition of Benchmark PBT.
Acquisition expenses are excluded from the definition of Benchmark PBT as they bear no relation to the underlying performance of the Group or to the performance of the acquired businesses.
Adjustments to contingent consideration are similarly excluded from the definition of Benchmark PBT.
An element of the Groups derivatives is ineligible for hedge accounting.
Gains or losses on these derivatives arising from market movements, together with gains and losses on put options in respect of acquisitions, are credited or charged to financing fair value remeasurements within finance expense in the Group income statement and excluded from the definition of Benchmark PBT.
b Earnings before interest and tax EBIT EBIT is defined as profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles, impairment of goodwill, acquisition expenses, adjustments to contingent consideration, exceptional items, net finance costs, tax and discontinued operations.
c Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA EBITDA is defined as EBIT before depreciation and amortisation charged therein.
d Discontinuing activities Discontinuing activities are businesses sold, closed or identified for closure during a financial year.
These are treated as discontinuing activities for both revenue and EBIT purposes.
The results of discontinuing activities are disclosed separately with the results of the prior period re-presented as appropriate.
This measure differs from the definition of discontinued operations set out in IFRS 5. e Continuing activities Businesses trading at 31 March 2014, which have not been disclosed as discontinuing activities, are treated as continuing activities.
f Constant exchange rates To highlight its organic performance, Experian discusses its results in terms of constant exchange rate growth, unless otherwise stated.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
g Total growth This is the year-on-year change in the performance of Experians activities.
Total growth at constant exchange rates removes the translational foreign exchange effects arising on the consolidation of Experians activities.
Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 119 h Organic growth This is the year-on-year change in the revenue of continuing activities, translated at constant exchange rates, excluding acquisitions until the first anniversary date of their consolidation.
i Benchmark earnings Benchmark earnings represents Benchmark PBT less attributable tax and non-controlling interests.
Benchmark earnings attributable to non-controlling interests represents that portion of Benchmark earnings that relate to non-controlling interests.
Benchmark PBT less attributable tax is designated as Overall benchmark earnings.
The attributable tax for this purpose excludes significant tax credits and charges arising in the year which, in view of their size or nature, are not comparable with previous years together with tax arising on exceptional items and on total adjustments made to derive Benchmark PBT.
j Benchmark earnings per share Benchmark EPS Benchmark EPS represents Benchmark earnings divided by a weighted average number of ordinary shares, and is disclosed to indicate the underlying profitability of the Group.
k Benchmark tax charge and rate The Benchmark tax charge is defined as the total tax charge as reported in the Group income statement, adjusted for the tax impact of non-Benchmark items.
The related effective rate of tax is calculated by dividing the Benchmark tax charge by Benchmark PBT.
l Exceptional items The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items gives an indication of the Groups underlying performance.
Exceptional items are those arising from the profit or loss on disposal of businesses, closure costs of major business units and costs of significant restructuring programmes.
All other restructuring costs are charged against EBIT, in the segments in which they are incurred.
m Operating and free cash flow Operating cash flow is defined as EBIT from continuing operations, plus amortisation, depreciation and charges in respect of sharebased incentive plans, less capital expenditure net of disposal proceeds and further adjusted for changes in working capital and the profit or loss retained in continuing associates.
Operating cash flow is reconciled to cash generated from operations in note 39 i.
Free cash flow is derived from operating cash flow by excluding net interest, tax paid in respect of continuing operations and dividends paid to non-controlling interests.
n Cash flow conversion Cash flow conversion is defined as operating cash flow expressed as a percentage of EBIT.
o Net debt Net debt is defined as borrowings and the fair value of derivatives hedging borrowings excluding accrued interest, less cash and cash equivalents reported in the Group balance sheet and other highly liquid bank deposits with original maturities greater than three months.
p Capital employed Capital employed is defined as net assets less non-controlling interests, further adjusted to add or deduct the net tax liability or asset and to add net debt.
120 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 8.
Financial risk management a Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
These are market risk, including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
These risks are unchanged from those reported in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The numeric disclosures in respect of financial risks are included within later notes to the financial statements, to provide a more transparent link between financial risks and results.
Financial risks represent part of the Groups risks in relation to its strategy and business objectives.
There is a full discussion of all such risks in the separate Protecting our business section of the annual report.
The Groups financial risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potentially adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to financial risks and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group also ensures surplus funds are prudently managed and controlled.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and investments in, and loans between, undertakings with different functional currencies.
The Group manages such risk, primarily within undertakings whose functional currencies are US dollars, by borrowing in the relevant currencies and using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The principal transaction exposures are to sterling and the euro.
An indication of the sensitivity to foreign exchange risk is given in note 10.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises principally from its net debt and the amounts at variable rates.
The Group has a policy of normally maintaining between 50% and 100% of net funding at rates that are fixed for more than six months.
Net funding for this purpose is the total funding less freely available unrestricted cash.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure by using fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are used to adjust the balance of fixed and floating rate liabilities.
The Group also mixes the duration of its borrowings to smooth the impact of interest rate fluctuations.
Further information in respect of the Groups net finance costs for the year and an indication of the sensitivity to interest rate risk is given in note 15. Credit risk In the case of derivative financial instruments, deposits and trade receivables, the Group is exposed to credit risk from the nonperformance of contractual agreements by the contracted party.
The Group minimises its credit risk for derivative financial instruments and deposits by only entering into such contracts with banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings, within limits set for each organisation.
Dealing and deposit activity is closely controlled and counterparty positions are monitored regularly.
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments utilised and deposits held by the Group is therefore not considered to be significant.
The Group does not anticipate that any losses will arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
Further information in respect of the Groups derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet dates is given in note 29 and that in respect of amounts recognised in the Group income statement is given in note 15.
Further information in respect of the Groups deposits at the balance sheet dates is given in note 24.
To minimise credit risk for trade receivables, the Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential clients before granting credit.
The maximum credit risk in respect of such financial assets is their carrying value.
Further information in respect of the Groups trade receivables is given in note 23.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains long-term committed borrowing facilities to ensure it has sufficient funds available for operations and planned growth.
The Group monitors rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure that it will have adequate undrawn committed facilities available.
Details of such facilities are given in note 26.
A maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows for financial liabilities is given in note 31. b Capital risk management The Groups definition and management of capital focuses on capital employed.
The Groups capital employed is reported in the net assets summary table set out in the Financial review and analysed by segment in note 9 a ii.
As part of its internal reporting processes, the Group monitors capital employed by operating segment.
The Groups objectives in managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure and cost of capital.
To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue or purchase shares or sell assets to reduce net debt.

In the year ended 31 March 2014, a deferred tax charge of US$23m was recognised as a consequence of the enacted reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 20% and the associated reduction in deferred tax assets recognised in respect of tax losses.
In the year ended 31 March 2013, the one-off tax credit of US$98m comprised a tax benefit on a corporate transaction in respect of the Groups subsidiary undertaking in Colombia.
c Factors that affect tax charges The effective tax rates for both years are higher than the main rate of UK corporation tax with the differences explained above.
The Groups tax charge in the future will continue to be influenced by the profile of profits earned in the different countries in which the Groups businesses operate and could be affected by changes in tax law.
In the UK, the main rate of corporation tax was reduced to 23% from 1 April 2013.
Further reductions reduce it to 21% from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015 and the effect of these reductions is recognised in these financial statements.

In the case of the EMEA CGU, the annual impairment review as at 31 March 2014 indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value by US$79m and that any decline in estimated value-in-use in excess of that amount would be liable to result in an impairment.
The sensitivity, which would result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value, is an absolute increase of 2.0% in the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital from 12.6% to 14.6%.
The decreases in both the long-term growth rate and EBIT margin that would be required to result in an impairment are not considered to be reasonably possible.
In the case of the Asia Pacific CGU, the annual impairment review as at 31 March 2014 indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value by US$48m and that any decline in estimated value-in-use in excess of that amount would be liable to result in an impairment.
The sensitivities, which result in the recoverable amount equalling the carrying value, can be summarised as follows: an absolute increase of 1.6% in the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital from 12.4% to 14.0%: or an absolute reduction of 2.0% in the long-term growth rate from 5.3% to 3.3%: or a reduction of 1.9% in the forecast terminal profit margin.
This is forecast to improve to a high single-digit margin in the terminal period but is below managements expectations for a mature region.
In addition a reduction in the annual margin improvement of approximately 0.4% per year over the five-year forecast period would also reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the other CGUs exceed their carrying value on the basis of the respective assumptions shown above and any reasonably possible changes thereof.

Assets and liabilities which are not traded in an active market and whose valuations are derived from available market data that is observable for the asset or liability are classified as Level 2.
Assets and liabilities whose valuations are derived from inputs not based on observable market data are classified as Level 3.
For Experian, Level 3 items principally comprise put and call options associated with corporate transactions with no material effect on the amounts stated from any reasonably possible change in Level 3 inputs at 31 March 2014. b Analysis of movements in Level 3 assets and liabilities Year ended 31 March 2014 Year ended 31 March 2013 Available-forOther Total Available-forSerasa put Other Total sale sale option US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m At 1 April 3 55 52 1,092 26 1,118 Additions and reclassifications 3 24 21 Valuation losses recognised in Group income statement 13 13 558 5 563 Currency translation gains recognised directly in other comprehensive income 2 2 163 163 fide-recognition of put option liability directly in equity 1,487 1,487 At 31 March 3 44 41 3 55 52 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 145 c Other financial assets and liabilities There are no material differences between the carrying value of the Groups other financial assets and liabilities and their estimated fair values.
The following assumptions and methods are used to estimate the fair values of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value: The fair value of receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents is considered to approximate to the carrying amounts: The fair values of short-term borrowings are considered to approximate to the carrying amounts due to the short maturity terms of such instruments: and The fair values of long-term borrowings are based on quoted market prices in the case of that portion of fixed rate borrowings not carried at fair value and are considered to approximate to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and finance lease obligations.
Of the Groups financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, bonds and notes are based on quoted market prices falling within Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Other financial assets and liabilities are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis and are within Level 2 of that hierarchy.

The only share options granted in the current and prior year have been in respect of Experian Sharesave Plans.
Although there have been no grants of options under the Experian Share Option Plan and equivalent legacy plans in the current and prior year, options remain outstanding under such plans.
As the amounts involved for all the share option plans and the related charge to the Group income statement are not significant, no further disclosures are included within these financial statements.
b Share awards i Summary of arrangements and performance conditions There are three plans under which share awards are currently granted the two Experian Co-Investment Plans the Experian CIPs and the Experian Performance Share Plan the Experian PSP.
Awards take the form of a grant of shares and vest over a service period of three years with a maximum term of the same length.
The method of settlement for the awards is by share distribution.
The assumption at grant date for employee departures prior to vesting is between 5% and 10% for conditional awards and 20% for certain unconditional awards which are only made under the Experian PSP.
Other details in respect of conditional awards are given below.
Performance conditions for vesting Assumed outcome at grant date Experian CIPs 50% Benchmark profit performance of Group Benchmark profit 66% to 100% assessed against specified targets 50% Cumulative operating cash flow of Group Cumulative operating cash flow 100% Experian PSP 75% Benchmark profit performance of Group Benchmark profit 66% to 100% assessed against specified targets 25% Distribution percentage determined by ranking TSR Range from 45% to 52% Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to a comparator group Experian CIPs The grant date for these plans is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed.
This is before the number of shares to be awarded is determined but the underlying value of the award is known, subject to the outcome of the performance condition.
The value of awarded shares reflects the performance outcome assumed at the date of their issue to participants and is recognised over a four-year period.
The range of performance conditions for awards under this plan is set out below.
The Benchmark profit performance condition the profit condition requires Benchmark PBT growth at the stated percentages over a three-year period.
The cumulative operating cash flow performance condition the cash flow condition is based on cumulative operating cash flow over a threeyear period.
The period of assessment commences at the beginning of the financial year of grant.
These are not market-based performance conditions as defined by IFRS 2.
Profit condition Cash flow condition Year of award Target Maximum Target Maximum Year ended 31 March 2014 7% per annum 14% per annum US$3.8bn US$4.2bn Year ended 31 March 2013 7% per annum 14% per annum US$3.7bn US$4.1bn Year ended 31 March 2012 7% per annum 14% per annum US$3.0bn US$3.4bn Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 147 Experian PSP The range of Benchmark profit performance conditions for conditional awards under this plan are the same as those shown in the table immediately above for the Experian CIPs and also require Benchmark PBT growth at the stated percentages over a threeyear period.
The TSR performance condition is considered a market-based performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
In valuing the awarded shares, TSR is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations for comparator companies measured over the three-year period preceding valuation and an implied volatility for Experian plc ordinary shares.
ii Information on share grant valuations Share grants are valued by reference to the market price on the day of award with no modification made for dividend distributions or other factors as participants are entitled to dividend distributions on awarded shares.
Market-based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
Awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2014 had a weighted average fair value per share of 12.02 2013: 8.91. iii Share awards outstanding 2014 2013 million million At 1 April 19.9 18.3 Grants 5.4 6.9 Forfeitures 0.6 0.5 Vesting 7.3 4.8 At 31 March 17.4 19.9 Analysis by plan: Experian CIPs 6.3 7.3 Experian PSP conditional awards 6.2 6.8 Experian PSP unconditional awards 4.9 5.8 At 31 March 17.4 19.9 148 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 33.
Post-employment benefit arrangements and related risks An overview of the Groups post-employment benefit arrangements and the related risks is given below.
The disclosures required by IAS 19 revised, which relate to the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements and post-retirement healthcare obligations only, are set out in note 34. a Funded pension arrangements The Groups principal defined benefit plan is the Experian Pension Scheme which provides benefits for certain UK employees but was closed to new entrants in the year ended 31 March 2009.
The Experian Pension Scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and, under this plan, the level of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is dependent on age, length of service and salary.
At the latest valuation date there were 269 active members of this plan, 1,780 deferred members and 3,155 pensioner members.
The Group provides a defined contribution plan, the Experian Retirement Savings Plan, to other eligible UK employees including new hires.
In common with other plans of this nature in the UK, membership of this plan has increased as a result of recent legislation introduced by the UK government.
Under this plan, employee and employer contributions are paid by the Group into an independently administered fund and used to fund member pensions at their retirement.
There were 3,286 active members of this plan at 31 March 2014.
Both the UK plans are governed by trust deeds which ensure that their finances and governance are independent from those of the Group.
Trustees are responsible for the oversight of the investments and funding of the plans and plan administration.
Employees in the US and Brazil have the option to join locally provided defined contribution plans and currently there are 3,892 active members in the US and 1,608 in Brazil.
There are no other material funded pension arrangements.
A full actuarial funding valuation of the Experian Pension Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2013 by independent, qualified actuaries, Towers Watson Limited, using the projected unit credit method.
The 2013 actuarial valuation has been agreed and there is a small deficit.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2016. b Unfunded pension arrangements The Group has had unfunded pension arrangements in place for a number of years designed to ensure that certain directors and senior managers in the UK who are affected by the earnings cap are placed in broadly the same position as those who are not.
Additionally there are unfunded arrangements for one current director of the Company and certain former directors and employees of Experian Finance plc.
Certain of these unfunded arrangements in the UK have been secured by the grant of charges to an independent trustee over an independently managed portfolio of marketable securities owned by the Group and reported as available-for-sale financial assets note 28. c Post-retirement medical benefits The Group operates plans which provide post-retirement medical benefits to certain retired employees and their dependant relatives.
The principal plan relates to former employees in the UK and, under this plan, the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of postretirement medical benefits for all eligible former employees who retired prior to 1 April 1994 and their dependants.
d Risks in connection with pension arrangements Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits arrangements, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in such plans and arrangements.
There are, however, no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk.
The risks can be summarised as follows: asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the related cash flows.
changes in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations mitigated by an increase in the value of plan assets.
inflation, as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation and the prevailing rate of inflation experienced for medical benefits is typically higher than other inflation measures in the UK.
life expectancy, as pension and medical benefits are generally provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependants.

Post-employment benefit assets and obligations An overview of the Groups post-employment benefit arrangements is given in note 33.
Experian adopted IAS 19 revised Employee benefits with effect from 1 April 2013 and the results for the year ended 31 March 2013 are re-presented accordingly.

The assumptions for discount rate, salary increases and mortality, used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations, all have a significant effect on the accounting valuation.
Changes to these assumptions in the light of prevailing conditions may have a significant impact on future valuations.
Indications of the sensitivity of the amounts reported at 31 March 2014 to changes in the discount rate, life expectancy and medical costs are included below.
The methods and types of assumptions used are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 March 2013 and the absolute sensitivity numbers are stated on a basis consistent with the methodology used in determining the accounting valuation at 31 March 2014.
The methodology evaluates the effect of a change in each assumption on the relevant obligations whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
i Principal financial actuarial assumptions 2014 2013 % % Discount rate 4.3 4.5 Inflation rate based on the UK Retail Prices Index RPI 3.3 3.4 Inflation rate based on the UK Consumer Prices Index CPI 2.3 2.4 Increase in salaries 3.8 4.4 Increase for pensions in payment element based on RPI where cap is 5% 3.0 3.1 Increase for pensions in payment element based on CPI where cap is 5% 1.7 2.4 Increase for pensions in payment element based on CPI where cap is 3% 1.9 2.0 Increase for pensions in deferment 2.3 2.4 Inflation in medical costs 6.8 6.9 The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
The discount rate is based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations.
In the case of the Experian Pension Scheme, the obligations are primarily in sterling and have a maturity of some 18 years.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2014 would decrease increase by approximately US$18m and the annual current service cost would remain unchanged.
The rates of increase for pensions in payment reflect the separate arrangements applying to different groups of Experians pensioners.
ii Mortality assumptions average life expectation on retirement at age 65 in normal health 2014 2013 years years For a male currently aged 65 23.2 22.5 For a female currently aged 65 25.0 23.7 For a male currently aged 50 24.6 23.6 For a female currently aged 50 26.9 24.8 The valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with standard tables adjusted to reflect the expected experience of the Experian Pension Scheme membership based on analysis carried out for the 31 March 2013 funding valuation.
A specific allowance for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy is also incorporated.
An increase in assumed life expectancy of 0.1 years would increase the defined benefit obligations at 31 March 2014 by approximately US$4m.
iii Post-retirement healthcare The valuation in respect of post-retirement healthcare benefits assumes a rate of increase for medical costs.
If this rate increased decreased by 1.0% per annum, the obligation would increase decrease by US$1m and the finance expense would remain unchanged.

Deferred and current tax continued iii Other information on deferred tax assets and liabilities At the balance sheet date there were deferred tax assets expected to reverse within the next year of US$200m 2013: US$186m.
The Group has not recognised assets of US$124m 2013: US$106m in respect of losses that could be utilised against future taxable income and assets of US$12m 2013: US$13m in respect of capital losses that could be utilised against future taxable gains.
These losses are available indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date there were deferred tax liabilities expected to reverse within the next year of US$44m 2013: US$41m.
There are retained earnings of US$12,020m 2013: US$11,364m in subsidiary undertakings which would be subject to tax if remitted to Experian plc.
Given the mix of countries and tax rates, it is not practicable to determine the impact of such remittance and accordingly no related deferred tax liabilities have been recognised.
The main rate of UK corporation tax has been reduced to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Deferred tax arising in the UK has therefore been provided principally at 20%.
A rate of 23% was used at 31 March 2013. b Net current tax assets liabilities 2014 2013 US$m US$m At 1 April 8 46 Tax charge in the Group income statement continuing operations note 16 139 184 Tax credit in the Group income statement discontinued operations note 17 7 136 Tax recognised directly in equity on transactions with owners 17 21 Tax paid note 39 d 30 75 Disposal of subsidiaries 1 Transfer in respect of assets held for sale 5 Other transfers 2 1 At 31 March 78 8 Net current tax assets liabilities are presented in the Group balance sheet as: Current tax assets 13 49 Current tax liabilities 91 41 At 31 March 78 8 Current tax recognised directly in equity on transactions with owners relates to employee share incentive plans.

Called up share capital and share premium account At 31 March 2014, there were 1,031.6m shares in issue 2013: 1,030.1m and 1.5m 2013: 1.1m shares were issued in the year then ended.
Further information relating to share capital is contained in note K to the parent company financial statements.
The difference between the amounts shown in the Group and parent company financial statements in respect of called up share capital and the share premium account arose due to the translation of the sterling amounts into US dollars at the different exchange rates on the different translation dates.

Movements on the hedging reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect hedging transactions which are not charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related tax.
Movements on the translation reserve and the position at the balance sheet date reflect foreign currency translations since 1 April 2004 which are not charged or credited to the Group income statement, net of related tax.
The movement in the year ended 31 March 2014 comprises currency translation losses of US$187m 2013: US$23m recognised directly in other comprehensive income, together with the reclassification of cumulative currency translation gains in respect of divestments of US$2m 2013: US$nil.
The balance on the own shares reserve is the cost of ordinary shares in the Company and further details are given in note iii below.
The difference between the amounts shown in the Group and parent company financial statements in respect of the own shares reserve arose due to the translation of the sterling amounts into US dollars at the different exchange rates on the different translation dates.

Acquisitions a Acquisitions in the year The Group made four acquisitions during the year, in connection with which provisional goodwill of US$831m was recognised based on the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$418m.
These transactions included: the acquisition on 1 October 2013 of the whole of the issued share capital of The 41st Parameter, Inc, a leading provider of fraud detection services based in the US, for an aggregate purchase consideration of US$324m of which US$14m is subject to limited, two-year revenue based earn-out provisions.
This acquisition increases Experians presence in the fraud prevention market, and complements Experians existing activities in fraud detection and online authentication.
the acquisition on 21 November 2013 of the whole of the issued share capital of Passport Health Communications, Inc. a leading provider of data, analytics and software in the US healthcare payment market, for a consideration of US$850m.
This acquisition further increases Experians presence in this market.

It has been impracticable to estimate the impact on Group profit after tax had the acquired entities been owned from 1 April 2013, as their accounting policies and period end dates did not accord with those of the Group prior to their acquisition.
ii For current and prior year acquisitions There have been no material gains, losses, error corrections or other adjustments recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 that relate to acquisitions in the current or prior years.

Contingencies There are a number of pending and threatened litigation claims involving the Group in North America and Latin America which are being vigorously defended.
The directors do not believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
However, as is inherent in legal proceedings, there is a risk of outcomes that are unfavourable to the Group.
In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group would benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.
As previously indicated, Serasa has been advised that the Brazilian tax authorities are challenging the deduction for tax purposes of goodwill amortisation arising from the acquisition of Serasa in 2007.
Experian believes that the possibility of this resulting in a liability to the Group is remote, on the basis of the advice of external legal counsel and other factors in respect of the claim.
The Group has continued to receive a significant number of claims in Brazil throughout the year, primarily in three states, relating to the disclosure and use of credit scores.
The cases are mainly individual small claims and also include a small number of class actions.
Similar proceedings have been commenced against other suppliers of credit scores in Brazil.
The Superior Tribunal of Justice STJ, the highest court in Brazil for such cases, has issued a stay on all proceedings relating to these claims while it determines the principal legal issues involved.
The Group does not believe the claims have merit under Brazilian law and will continue to vigorously defend them.
Accordingly, no provision has been made for the ultimate outcome.
Given the number of possible outcomes and the different potential courses of action which may be available to the Group, it cannot reliably quantify the possible exposure.
Related party transactions a Subsidiary undertakings and associates Significant subsidiary undertakings at 31 March 2014 are shown in note O to the parent company financial statements.
