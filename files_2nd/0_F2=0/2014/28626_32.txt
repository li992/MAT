A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The company is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 46.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 514,000 2013: 6,333,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pretax impact on net assets of 31,000 2013: 617,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.

Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2014 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 514 514 money market funds 10,000 10,000 Derivative financial instruments 1,030 1,030 Total financial assets 514 10,000 1,030 11,544 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2013 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 5,642 691 6,333 money market funds 35,000 35,000 Derivative financial instruments 1,030 1,030 5,642 35,000 1,721 42,363 The company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
