SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards ismeasured at the date of grant.
The fair value is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques.
The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Planwhere the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
In terms of FRS 20 Share-based Payment, where a parent grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, andsuch share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, thesubsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as acontribution from the parent.
