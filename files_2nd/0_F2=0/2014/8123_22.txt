STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 129 FAIR VALUE OF NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES With the exception of the Senior Notes due 2022 and Convertible Bonds, the fair values of all non-derivative financial instruments approximate to the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
The following methods and assumptions have been used to determine fair values: the fair values of cash at bank, overdrafts and short-term deposits approximate their carrying values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments see note 16 : the fair value of trade and other receivables and payables, accrued income and costs, and deferred consideration approximate their carrying values see notes 17 and 20 respectively : an investment classied as available-for-sale was carried at fair value in the Balance Sheet, which was determined according to the binding agreement with a third party for the sale of the asset see note 15 : the carrying amount of deferred satellite payments represents the present value of future payments discounted, using an appropriate rate, at the period end.
This carrying amount approximately equals fair value see note 19 : the Senior Notes due 2022 are reected in the Balance Sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs and net issuance premium of $8.7m and $7.6m, respectively see note 19.
The fair values of the Senior Notes due 2022 are based on the market price of the bonds and are reected in the table below: the EIB Facility is reected in the Balance Sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs of $0.6m 2013: $1.1m.
The fair value approximates the carrying value see note 19 : the Ex-Im Bank Facilities are reected in the Balance Sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs of $18.9m 2013: $18.1m.
The fair value approximates the carrying value see note 19 : and the liability component of the Convertible Bonds is reected in the Balance Sheet on an amortised cost basis, net of unamortised arrangement costs of $nil 2013: $1.0m see note 19.
The fair value of the Convertible Bonds is based on the market price of the bonds and is reected in the table below.

DISPOSAL GROUPS HELD FOR SALE On 7 November 2014, the Group announced that it had entered into binding agreements to sell its 19% holding in SkyWave to ORBCOMM Inc. for total proceeds of $32.9m.
The investment in SkyWave, with a carrying amount of $23.5m, was reclassied to assets held for sale.
As the investment had been categorised as an available-for-sale financial asset, it was remeasured to its fair value of $32.9m as at 31 December 2014.
The resulting gain was recognised through other comprehensive income.
The sale subsequently closed on 2 January 2015 and the gain was reclassied to profit at that time.
On 3 February 2014, following regulatory and other approvals, the Group announced completion of the sale of the majority of its retail energy business to RigNet, Inc. RigNet.
The sale included the Groups microwave and WiMAX networks in the US Gulf of Mexico, VSAT interests in the UK, the US and Canada, telecommunications systems integration business operating worldwide and retail L-band energy satcoms business.
In addition, the Group sold its interest in retail energy-related teleport assets located in Moscow.
Total fair value of the net assets of the disposal group as at 31 December 2013 was $23.8m and included assets classied as held for sale of $42.8m and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale of $19.0m.
Total proceeds on the sale of the retail energy business and related assets were $27.0m.
CAPITAL COMMITMENTS The Group had authorised and contracted but not provided for capital commitments as at 31 December 2014 of $504.0m 2013: $713.3m.
These amounts primarily represent commitments in respect of the Groups GX and S-Band satellite programmes.
CONTINGENT LIABILITY The Group has received enquiries from Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC in respect of arrangements which have been entered into in prior periods.
The potential tax liability in relation to these enquiries is estimated to be in the region of $18m.
The Group has sought external advice and management does not believe that a material economic outow is probable: therefore no provision has been recorded in these financial statements.
However, this disclosure has been made in light of the ongoing enquiries being made by HMRC.
No accurate estimation of the time required to settle this matter can currently be given.
