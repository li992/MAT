a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP and the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued in 2009. b Investments The Companys investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as the Companys business is to invest in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
Quoted investments are valued at their fair value, which is represented by the bid price.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its fair value.
Purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on trade date.
As investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the capital return for the period and transaction costs on acquisition or disposal of a security are expensed to the capital reserve.
c Income Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are accounted for on the ex-dividend date as revenue, except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is treated as a return of capital.
Dividend income is shown excluding any related tax credit.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any surplus or deficit in the value of the shares received compared to the cash dividend forgone is recognised as capital.
Other income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to revenue except as follows: expenses that are incidental to the acquisition and disposal of an investment are charged to capital: and expenses are charged to capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
e Finance costs Interest costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 62.5% to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
The arrangement fee in relation to the 125 million bank debt facility is being amortised over the expected life of the facility with 62.5% allocated to capital reserve and 37.5% to revenue reserve on a straight line basis.
The unamortised value of these costs is deducted from the fair value of the bank debt facility.
f Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: gains on the return of capital by way of investee companies paying special dividends: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, charged to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
g Special reserve This reserve may be treated as distributable profits for all purposes, excluding the payment of dividends.
The cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation is accounted for in this reserve.
h Revenue reserve This reserve represents the only reserve from which dividends can be funded.

Level 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables includes only data from observable markets.
Level 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The following table shows the reconciliations from opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

A 0.10% arrangement fee was paid on entering into the agreement and is being amortised over the expected life of the facility.
Under the facility, all funds drawn down attract interest at a margin of 0.80% over LIBOR.
A non-utilisation fee is also payable on any undrawn element, at a rate of 0.25% per annum.
The main covenant under the facility requires that, every month, total borrowings shall not exceed 25% of the Companys total adjusted gross assets.
There were no breaches of the covenants during the year.
As at 31 December 2014, total borrowings represented 3.0% of total adjusted gross assets as defined by Facility Agreement.
The current facility is due to expire on 15 June 2017.

Bank debt facilities are utilised when the Managers believe it is in the interest of the Company to gear the portfolio.
Note 1 sets out the significant accounting policies, including criteria for recognition and the basis of measurement applied for significant financial instruments excluding cash at bank, which is carried at fair value.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i interest rate risk, being the risk that the interest receivable payable and the market value of investment holdings may fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: ii liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty raising funds to meet its cash commitments as they fall due.
Liquidity risk may result from either the inability to sell financial instruments quickly at their fair values or from the inability to generate cash inflows as required: iii credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: and iv market price risk, being the risk that the market value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement.
The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in sterling and therefore the Company is not directly exposed to any significant currency risk.
However, it is recognised that most investee companies, whilst listed in the UK, will be exposed to global economic conditions and currency fluctuations.
i Interest rate risk When the Company decides to hold cash balances, all balances are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding 0.1% as at 31 December 2014 2013: 0.4%.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate bank accounts and not usually to invest in fixed rate securities.
The Companys investment portfolio is not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
The Company has a bank debt facility of 125,000,000 of which 34,250,000 was drawn down as at 31 December 2014 2013: debt facility of 100,000,000, of which 32,000,000 was drawn down.
Further details of this facility can be found in Note 12.
If LIBOR and the bank base rate had increased by 1% point, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been negative 342,000 2013: negative 320,000.
If LIBOR and the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5% point, the impact on the profit 46 Financial Report Aberforth Smaller Companies Trust plc 118786 ASCOT Txt PRINT 118786 ASCOT Txt V11 29 01 2015 16:44 Page 47 Notes to the Financial Statements 18 Financial instruments continued i Interest rate risk continued or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been a positive 171,000 2013: positive 160,000.
There would be no direct impact on the portfolio valuation.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
ii Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable equity securities, which, if necessary, can be sold to meet any funding requirements.
Short term funding flexibility can be achieved through the use of bank debt facilities.
The Companys current liabilities all have a remaining contractual maturity of less than three months with the exception of the bank debt facility.
iii Credit risk The Company invests in UK equities traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of FCA regulated brokers with trades typically undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis and on a short settlement period.
The investment portfolio assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company, the Companys custodian, in a segregated account.
In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Northern Trust the Companys rights with respect to the securities held by the custodian may be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing Northern Trusts credit ratings and their internal control report.
Cash at bank is held with reputable banks with acceptable external credit ratings.
Furthermore the Companys Depositary is contractually liable to the Company for the loss of any assets entrusted to it.
The exposure to credit risk at the year-end comprises: 2014 2013 000 000 Investment income receivable 2,197 2,067 Amounts due from brokers 436 Cash at bank 238 536 2,871 2,603 iv Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the investment managers in pursuance of the investment objective.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Managers Report on pages 8 to 12.
It is not the Managers policy to use derivatives or hedging instruments to manage market price risk.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20% at 31 December 2014, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been negative 227.8m 2013: negative 233.5m.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20% at 31 December 2014, the impact on the profit or loss and therefore Shareholders funds would have been positive 227.8m 2013: 233.5m.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole and assume all other variables remain constant.
As at 31 December 2014, all of the Companys financial instruments excluding loans were included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The investment portfolio consisted of listed investments valued at their bid price, which represents fair value.
Any cash balances, which are held in variable rate bank accounts, can be withdrawn on demand with no penalty.

This is achieved through the appropriate balance of equity capital and gearing.
Further details can be found in the Strategic Report.
19 Contingencies, guarantees, financial commitments and contingent assets The Company had no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments as at 31 December 2014 2013: nil.
The Company may be able to recover further amounts in respect of VAT charged on investment management fees.
However, the Board considers that currently there are too many uncertainties to recognise any amounts potentially recoverable from HM Revenue &Customs.
