Notes 41 and 42 cover these liabilities, and note 43 details the financial guarantees and options given for some of these products.
Note 44 details the reinsurance recoverables on these liabilities while note 45 shows the effects of changes in the assumptions.
The following is a summary of the contract provisions and related reinsurance assets as at 31 December.
a Carrying amount i Insurance liabilities gross of reinsurance at 31 December comprise: 2014 2013 General General Long-term insurance Long-term insurance and business and health Total business health Total m m m m m m Long-term business provisions Participating 44,834 44,834 45,098 45,098 Unit-linked non-participating 7,963 7,963 8,714 8,714 Other non-participating 45,313 45,313 41,160 41,160 98,110 98,110 94,972 94,972 Outstanding claims provisions 1,343 7,298 8,641 1,287 7,730 9,017 Provision for claims incurred but not reported 2,578 2,578 2,568 2,568 1,343 9,876 11,219 1,287 10,298 11,585 Provision for unearned premiums 4,107 4,107 4,226 4,226 Provision arising from liability adequacy tests 10 10 10 10 Total 99,453 13,993 113,446 96,259 14,534 110,793 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 1 1 106 132 238 99,453 13,992 113,445 96,153 14,402 110,555 ii Change in insurance liabilities recognised as an expense The purpose of the following table is to reconcile the change in insurance liabilities, net of reinsurance, shown on the income statement, to the change in insurance liabilities recognised as an expense in the relevant movement tables in this note.
The components of the reconciliation are the change in provision for outstanding claims on long-term business which is not included in a separate movement table, and the unwind of discounting on GI reserves which is included within finance costs within the income statement.
For general insurance and health business, the change in the provision for unearned premiums is not included in the reconciliation, as within the income statement, this is included within earned premiums.

Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
The RIEESA has been used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In other operations in Europe and Asia, a range of long-term insurance and savings products are written.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Material judgment is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
For UK with-profit life funds falling within the scope of the PRA realistic capital regime, and hence FRS 27, an amount may be recognised for the present value of future profits PVFP on non-participating business written in a with-profit fund where the determination of the realistic value of liabilities in that with-profit fund takes account, directly or indirectly, of this value.
For our UK with-profit funds, no adjustment for this value is made to the participating insurance and investment contract liabilities or the unallocated divisible surplus.

Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guarantees on surrender, including no-MVR Market Value Reduction Guarantees and Guarantees linked to inflation Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP Guaranteed Minimum Pension underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK swaps is used for the valuation of With-Profits business.
The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2014 of 1.88% 2013: 3.11% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
Volatility 2014 2013 Equity returns 22.3% 22.1% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 27.2% 16.3% The equity volatility used depends on term, money-ness and region.
The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.
Fixed interest yield volatility is also dependent on term and money-ness.
The figure shown is for a ten-year swap option with ten-year term, currently at the money.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2015 have been set consistently with the year-end 2014 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of each fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions for with-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2014 2013 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement IFRS Financial statements | A Aviva viva p plc lc A An nn nu ua al r l re ep po orrt a t an nd a d ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 14 4 191 191 41 Insurance liabilities continued Allowance for future mortality improvement is in line with the rates shown for non-profit business below.
Non-profit business The valuation of non-profit business is based on regulatory requirements, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business.
Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2014 2013 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 1.7% 2.5% Pensions conventional non-profit 2.1% 3.2% Annuities Conventional immediate and deferred annuities 1.3% to 3.3% 3.2% to 4.7% Non-unit reserves on Unit Linked business Life 1.7% 2.8% Pensions 2.1% 3.5% Income Protection Active lives 1.8% 2.9% Claims in payment level 1.8% 3.1% Claims in payment index linked 0.9 % 0.6 % The above valuation discount rates are after reduction for investment expenses and credit risk.
For conventional immediate annuity business the allowance for credit risk comprises long-term assumptions for defaults and downgrades, which vary by asset category and rating, and short-term supplementary allowances for higher expected defaults during the current economic conditions.
The credit risk allowance made for corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited equated to 55 bps and 87 bps respectively at 31 December 2014 2013: 48 bps and 124 bps respectively.
For corporate bonds, the allowance represented c. 40% of the average credit spread for the portfolio 2013: 44%.
The total valuation allowance held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited in respect of corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, was 1.9 billion 2013: 2.0 billion over the remaining term of the UK Life corporate bond and mortgage portfolio.
Total liabilities for the annuity business were 34 billion at 31 December 2014 2013: 30 billion.
During 2014 there has been a change to the model and assumptions used to value certain equity release assets and the consequential impact on the liabilities that they back.
The revised model derives a best estimate view on property growth and explicitly calculates the additional return that would be demanded by investors due to uncertainties in the asset cash flows.
This results in a lower value of assets and a corresponding lower value of liabilities due to changes in the valuation interest rate.
Changes in the Aviva Annuity UK Limited net asset value are driven by changes in the No Negative Equity Guarantee NNEG as any changes to asset values that are not driven by NNEG result in a corresponding offset to the liability values through a revised valuation interest rate.
As a result the annuity liabilities have reduced by 452 million and the backing equity release mortgages have reduced by 278 million during the year.
Mortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality tables used 2014 2013 Assurances Non-profit AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 adjusted adjusted for smoker status and for smoker status and age sex age sex specific factors specific factors Pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting AM00 AF00 adjusted AM00 AF00 adjusted Annuities in payment Pensions business and general annuity business PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement | 19 192 2 A Aviva viva p plc lc A An nn nu ua all r re ep po orrtt a an nd d a ac cc co ou unfit ntss 2 20 01 14 4 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 41 Insurance liabilities continued For the main pensions annuity business in Aviva Annuity UK Limited, the underlying mortality assumptions for Males are 101.5% of PCMA00 2013: 102.0% of PCMA00 with base year 2000: for Females the underlying mortality assumptions are 96.5% of PCFA00 2013: 97.5% of PCFA00 with base year 2000.
Improvements are materially unchanged from prior year and are based on CMI 2013 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.75% for males and 1.5% for females, both with an addition of 0.5% to all future annual improvement.
Year-specific adjustments are made to allow for selection effects due to the development of the Enhanced Annuity market.
b France The majority of reserves arise from single premium savings products and are based on the accumulated fund values, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
For traditional business, the net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2014 and 2013 2014 and 2013 TD73-77, TD88-90, TH00-02 TF00-02, H AVDBS, F AVDBS Life assurances 0% to 4.5% H SSDBS, F SSDBS Annuities 0% to 4.5% TGF05 TGH05 c Other countries In all other countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the gross long-term business provisions during the year: 1 2014 2013 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 94,972 131,190 Provisions in respect of new business 4,796 5,671 Expected change in existing business provisions 5,806 8,015 Variance between actual and expected experience 1,383 2,871 Impact of operating assumption changes 1,118 428 Impact of economic assumption changes 6,819 2,812 Other movements 227 235 Change in liability recognised as an expense 5,847 2,092 2 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 805 34,441 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,904 509 Other movements 194 Carrying amount at 31 December 98,110 94,972 1 The 2013 comparatives include US Life in each line of the analysis up to the effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals item.
2 The movement during 2014 includes 103 million related to the disposal of Eurovita, 696 million related to the disposal of CxG and 6 million related to the restructuring of our operations in Indonesia.
The variance between actual and expected experience of 1.4 billion in 2014 is primarily due to the impact of favourable property returns on liabilities for unit-linked and participating contracts in the UK and Ireland.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Less significant variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors in Italy and Spain.
The impact of operating assumption changes of 1.1 billion in 2014 reduces the carrying value of insurance liabilities and relates mainly to longevity and expense releases in the UK business with the impact on profit significantly offset by a corresponding reduction in reinsurance assets.
The 6.8 billion impact of economic assumption changes reflects reductions in valuation interest rates, primarily in respect of immediate annuity and participating insurance contracts in the UK.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 45, together with the impact of movements in related nonfinancial assets.
c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date.
The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
IFRS Financial statements | A Aviva viva p plc lc A An nn nu ua al r l re ep po orrt a t an nd a d ac cc co ou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 14 4 193 193 41 Insurance liabilities continued The Group only establishes loss reserves for losses that have already occurred.
The Group therefore does not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.
As at 31 December 2014 As at 31 December 2013 Outstanding Outstanding claim IBNR Total claim claim IBNR Total claim provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions m m m m m m Motor 3,510 1,130 4,640 3,724 1,001 4,725 Property 1,402 67 1,469 1,493 180 1,673 Liability 1,916 1,224 3,140 2,035 1,208 3,243 Creditor 25 21 46 26 18 44 Other 445 136 581 452 161 613 7,298 2,578 9,876 7,730 2,568 10,298 ii Discounting Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2014 2013 2014 2013 Reinsured London Market business 2.1% 2.5% 10 years 12 years Latent claims 0.16% to 2.75% 0.36% to 3.76% 6 to 15 years 6 to 15 years Structured settlements 2.0% 2.8% 35 years 35 years The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 10,326 million 2013: 10,914 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 6 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected outside of operating profit as an economic assumption change.
During 2014, the Group has seen a reduction in the number of new bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements, which are reserved for on a discounted basis.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case setting procedures.
Claim technicians apply their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
They take into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for estimate authorisation.
No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
| 19 194 4 A Aviva viva p plc lc A An nn nu ua all r re ep po orrtt a an nd d a ac cc co ou unfit ntss 2 20 01 14 4 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 41 Insurance liabilities continued The following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate 245 million 2013: 235 million greater than the best estimate, or 75 million 2013: 70 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2014, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 120 million 2013: 90 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 58.
Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables.
The Ogden Tables contain a discount rate that is set by the Lord Chancellor and that is applied when calculating the present value of loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
The process for setting this discount rate is under review.
The timing of the conclusion of this review is unclear and it is still uncertain whether or by how much the rate will change.
However an allowance has been included in provisions for a change in the Ogden discount rates.
A reduction in the Ogden discount rates would increase lump sum payments to UK bodily injury claimants.

In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 7,106 million was re-estimated to be 6,612 million at 31 December 2014.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
The Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2014 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2014 were: 112 million release from UK & Ireland due to favourable development in UK & Ireland on personal and commercial motor, and commercial property claims.
97 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
15 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development in France and Italy, partly offset by strengthening of motor third party claims in Turkey.
Key elements of the movement in prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2013 were: 32 million release from UK & Ireland, including Group reinsurance business, mainly due to favourable development in health, commercial motor and commercial liability in Ireland, slightly offset by a small strengthening in the UK.
160 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
9 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development across a number of lines of business in France.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2005.
The undiscounted claim provisions for continuing operations, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2014 were 984 million 2013: 976 million.
The movement in the year reflects reclassification from other commercial liability provisions of 65 million partly offset by favourable claims development of 12 million in the UK 2013: 5 million strengthening, other decreases in undiscounted provisions of 12 million 2013: 2 million, claim payments net of reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange rate movements.
