Statement of directors shareholding and share interests audited information In order to further align the executive directors long term interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has introduced new share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017 18.
The guidelines require that, with effect from 2017 18, when the first awards to be granted under the 2014 LTIP are due to vest, executive directors retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans and retain up to half of any bonus pay-out after tax to purchase shares in the Company until the value of their shareholding is equal to 125% of gross basic salary.
Until this shareholding is acquired, the executive directors may not, without Remuneration Committee approval, sell shares other than to finance any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of LTIP awards.
Prior to 2017 18, executive directors will be required to retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans until the value of their shareholding is equal to 100% of gross basic salary.
B. C. Short, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott met the 100% of gross basic salary requirement applicable for the year to 26 January 2014.
