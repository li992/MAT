The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the impact of the accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by adding to or deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the effective value of the annual share award in order better to match the underlying staff costs in the year with the revenue recognised in the same period.
Profit on disposal of available-for-sale investments includes a 1.7m profit from the disposal of the Groups 3.03% holding in Pinnacle Regeneration Group Limited in January 2014, the final receipt in relation to the disposal of the Groups 4.3% shareholding in IPD Group Ltd in 2012 0.5m and a 0.2m loss arising from the disposal of the Groups 2.03% shareholding in the Cordea Savills Student Hall Fund in July 2014.
Acquisition related costs include transaction costs of 6.7m and 9.9m of provisions for future payments in relation to the Studley, Inc. acquisition, which are expensed through the income statement to reflect the requirement for the recipients to remain actively engaged in the business at the payment date.
