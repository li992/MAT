STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND OPERATIONS Ore reserves Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 the JORC Code as required by the Australian Securities Exchange ASX.
Codes or guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, the US, Chile, Peru, the Philippines, the UK, Ireland and Europe.
Together these Codes represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long-term commodity prices, in calculating Ore Reserve estimates.
However, for US reporting, the US Securities and Exchange Commission requires historical price data to be used.
For this reason, some Ore Reserves reported to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those reported below.
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information in the tables below is based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by JORC, most of whom are full time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies.
Each has had a minimum of five years relevant estimation experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics.
Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears.
Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on pages XX and XX, by operation, along with their professional affiliation, employer and accountability for Ore Reserves and or Mineral Resources.
Where operations are not managed by RioTinto, theOre Reserves are published as received from the managing company.
The Ore Reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2014.
Summary data for year end 2013 are shown for comparison.
Metric units are used throughout.
The figures used to calculate Rio Tintos share of Ore Reserves are often more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.
