FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Corporate information KAZ Minerals PLC the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The Companys registered office is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom.
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Restructuring which resulted in the sale of a number of the Groups relatively mature mining and power operations, primarily located in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions the Disposal Assets completed on 31 October 2014.
As a result of this transaction, the Company which was previously known as Kazakhmys PLC changed its name to KAZ Minerals PLC.
Following the Restructuring, the Group consists of the East Region operations, Bozymchak and the major growth projects.
The Group operates within the natural resources sector through three divisions, the principal activities of which during 2014 were: Primary country Operating division Principal activity of operations East Region operations Mining and copper processing operations Kazakhstan Mining Projects Mining and copper processing development projects Kazakhstan Bozymchak Mining and copper processing development project Kyrgyzstan The legal names of the constituent companies within the above divisions are shown in note 38 m. From 15 August 2014, the date the independent shareholders approved the Restructuring, the Disposal Assets were classified as assets held for sale and have been treated as a discontinued operation in these financial statements see note 14 a.
Basis of preparation The financial statements set out on pages 110 to 170 have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with IFRSs.
The Company has taken the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not published the Companys income statement and related notes.
a Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth and operating performance, are set out in the Operating Review on pages 38 to 45.
The financial performance and position of the Group, its cash flows and available debt facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 46 to 57.
In addition, note 33 commencing on page 147 sets out the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital structure, liquidity position and financial risks arising from exposures to commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange and counterparties.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities and working capital funds.
The Board monitors the net debt level of the Group taking into consideration the expected outlook of the Groups financial position, cash flows and future capital commitments.
The Group adopts a prudent approach in managing its liquidity risk, reflecting the volatility in commodity prices.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups net debt was $962 million with total undrawn committed facilities of $798 million.
At 31 December 2014, $692 million of the $1.5 billion loan facility with CDB, to be used for the development of the major copper project at Aktogay, was drawn.
The funds are available to draw down over a three and a half year period commencing from 31 December 2012 and mature 15 years from the date of the first draw down.
On 29 October 2014, the Group amended the $500 million PXF facility that was signed in December 2012.
The amended facility is available for general corporate purposes and provides additional liquidity during the period of the development of the major growth projects at Bozshakol and Aktogay.
At 31 December 2014, the amended PXF facility was fully drawn at $349 million, with $151 million of the original facility having been repaid.
The principal repayments will amortise over a three year period commencing in January 2016 until final maturity in December 2018.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had gross liquid funds of $2.1 billion and an additional $798 million available only for the development of the Aktogay copper project.
The Directors have considered the Groups financial position, the available borrowing facilities, the planned capital expenditure programme and the outlook for the Groups products and major growth projects, and believe there is sufficient funding available to meet the Groups anticipated cash flow requirements.
The Board is mindful of the Groups exposure to a single commodity and to the successful delivery of the Groups major growth projects in the medium term.
A severe downturn in the copper price or material adverse developments on the major growth projects would impact future funding requirements.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future which is for this purpose a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all financial information has been rounded to the nearest million dollars $ million except where otherwise indicated.
com 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Basis of preparation continued c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2014 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct those activities of an enterprise that most significantly affect the returns the Group earns from its involvement with the enterprise.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This treatment may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled through the income statement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Prior to the completion of the Restructuring, Kazakhmys LLC underwent a demerger which created Vostoktsvetmet LLC, which holds the East Region operating assets.
As a result of the demerger, the non-controlling interests in the East Region assets, which were previously within Kazakhmys LLC, remain with Vostoktsvetmet LLC.
The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Company.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
Refer to note 38 m for a list of the Companys significant subsidiaries.
d Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union EU, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. e Adoption of standards and interpretations In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has applied the following standards on their effective date: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The Group adopted IFRS 10 with effect from 1 January 2014.
This has not had a material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Consequently, no adjustment has been made to the comparative financial information as at 31 December 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The Group has adopted IFRS 11 with effect from 1 January 2014.
The adoption of the standard has not had a material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: The Group has adopted IFRS 12 with effect from 1 January 2014.
The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that were issued but are not yet effective.
f New standards and interpretations not yet adopted In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has not applied the following relevant standards and interpretations.
The Groups adoption of these standards and interpretations is dependent on the date they become effective for application in the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: the IASB effective date is 1 January 2018, however the standard has yet to be endorsed by the EU.
Based on the nature of the Groups financial assets, the adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: the standard was issued in 2014 with an IASB effective date of 1 January 2017.
The standard has yet to be endorsed by the EU.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 on its financial position and reporting of performance.
Improvements to IFRSs: There are a number of amendments to certain standards following the 2013 annual improvements project which have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The impact of any consequential changes to the consolidated financial statements is not expected to be significant.
g Comparative information Where a change in the presentation format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
116 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 116 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sale of a number of the Groups relatively mature mining and power operations, primarily located in the Zhezkazgan and Central Regions the Disposal Assets was approved by the independent shareholders on 15 August 2014.
As a result these operations were reclassified as assets held for sale and as a discontinued operation from that date.
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 has been restated to conform to this presentation.
The sale completed on 31 October 2014. h Devaluation of the tenge On 11 February 2014, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced it would seek to support the tenge at around 185 KZT to the US dollar, resulting in a devaluation of approximately 19%.
The impact of the devaluation in the condensed consolidated financial statements is as follows: net finance costs of $263 million includes net foreign exchange losses of $181 million from continuing operations which primarily arose from the retranslation of tenge denominated monetary assets and liabilities, particularly on intercompany loans, within the Groups UK subsidiaries which have a US dollar functional currency.
The foreign exchange losses arising on the devaluation of the tenge are nonoperational and have been treated as a special item: the loss for the year from discontinued operations includes a net foreign exchange gain of $24 million: and non-cash foreign exchange loss of $430 million recognised within equity, primarily due to the retranslation on consolidation of the Groups Kazakhstan based subsidiaries whose functional currency is the tenge, which mainly arose at the time of the devaluation, of which $180 million relates to continuing operations and $250 million to discontinued operations.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the course of preparing these financial statements, the Directors make necessary judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Judgements are based on the Directors best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions applied are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Critical accounting judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, which the Directors believe are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations On 15 August 2014, the Groups independent shareholders approved the sale of the Disposal Assets, within the previous Kazakhmys Mining and Kazakhmys Power segments.
The Directors believed it was highly probable that the disposal would complete within 12 months following independent shareholder approval.
As a result, the Disposal Assets were classified as assets held for sale at 15 August 2014, and reflected as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement for the period ended 31 October 2014, when the sale completed.
On the date of classification, the Disposal Assets were remeasured to the fair value less costs to sell of nil, resulting in a charge of $1.6 billion being recognised.
On 5 December 2013, the Board of Directors accepted an offer from Samruk-Energo, an investment vehicle of the Government of Kazakhstan, for the sale of the Groups 50% joint venture in Ekibastuz GRES-1 and the Groups investment in Kazhydrotechenergo LLP Kaz Hydro for $1,249 million, after transaction costs of $2 million and the additional $49 million, being the cost of acquiring the remaining shares held in Kaz Hydro.
After considering the status of the sales process, the Directors believed that it was highly probable a sale would complete within 12 months.
As a result, the Groups investments in Ekibastuz GRES-1 and Kaz Hydro were classified as assets held for sale at 31 December 2013, with Ekibastuz GRES-1 being classified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement for the period ended 5 December 2013.
The sale completed on 1 April 2014.
Determination of excess profits taxation EPT Discontinued operations In 2011, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan ruled that Kazakhmys LLC should not have been an EPT payer in the periods up to and including 2008.
Kazakhmys LLC subsequently submitted a claim for $108 million to the Ministry of Finance.
During 2012, $60 million had been reimbursed by set-off against the 2012 tax year income tax and MET liabilities and was recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a special item.
The remaining $48 million of the $108 million claim was challenged by the Ministry of Finance, who believed that this amount related to periods beyond the Kazakhstan statute of limitations.
In 2013, the Ministry of Finance continued its legal action over the $48 million claim, with their appeal reaching the Supreme Court.
In October 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Kazakhmys LLC confirming Kazakhmys LLCs right to receive the $48 million $39 million at year end exchange rates of the past EPT payments.
Due to the ongoing uncertainty following a legal appeal by the tax authorities against the Supreme Courts decision, no credit was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2013. www.
com 117 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 3.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Due to actions taken by the tax authorities during 2014, management continued to believe that sufficient uncertainty remained over the recoverability of this amount such that no credit was recognised in the Disposal Assets financial statements as at 31 October 2014, the date of disposal.
b Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of assets The Directors review the carrying value of the Groups assets to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment such that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment has arisen requires considerable judgement, taking account of future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, sales demand and the competitive environment.
Where such indicators exist, the carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use, which is determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.
This involves management estimates of commodity prices, market demand and supply, the development of operating costs, economic and regulatory climates, capital expenditure requirements, long-term mine plans and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of the assets.
Bozymchak During the year ended 31 December 2014, Bozymchak recognised a $128 million impairment charge following the identification of a number of impairment indicators.
In determining the value-in-use of the Bozymchak project, the Directors made estimates of the future cash flows to be generated by this project with the key variables being copper and gold price assumptions, the mine economics such as copper grades, capital expenditure to complete the project and its commissioning date for commercial production see note 7.
The Zhezkazgan Region within the Disposal Assets and discontinued operations The asset review performed in 2013 considered the results of the optimisation programme and the potential for future savings, when assessing the future economic outlook for assets.
The prospects for the Zhezkazgan Region, a cash generating unit CGU previously within Kazakhmys Mining, were considered challenging.
The recoverable amount of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU was believed by management to be significantly lower than its carrying value such that an impairment charge of $575 million was recognised at 31 December 2013 see note 14.
The calculation of the fair value less costs to sell of the Groups CGUs for the impairment review at 31 December 2013 provided a range of outcomes which were particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, operating cost inflation, capital expenditure and the discount rate used.
Any changes to the assumptions adopted in the calculation of the fair value less costs to sell, individually or in aggregate, would result in a different valuation being determined.
The Directors note that following the impairments recognised in 2013, the deficit between the Groups net asset value and its market capitalisation remained significant at 31 December 2013.
This deficit was largely due to the fact that under accounting standards, the carrying value of the assets could not be negative, whilst the valuation of the same assets on a discounted cash flow basis could result in values below zero.
In particular, whilst the Zhezkazgan Region CGU was written down to nil, the forecast discounted cash flows resulted in a significant negative amount which could not be recognised at 31 December 2013.
The Directors considered this and other circumstances that contributed to the difference between the Groups net asset value and market capitalisation and believed that despite this difference there were no further impairments necessary in respect of the Groups other CGUs.
The Zhezkazgan Region CGUs assets formed part of the Disposal Assets that were divested by the Group on 31 October 2014.
Determination of ore reserves and useful lives of property, plant and equipment Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups mining properties.
In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by competent persons as defined in accordance with the JORC Code.
A review of the Groups reserves and resources is undertaken on an annual basis by an independent competent person.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral reserves are only taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction proven and probable mineral reserves.
Since the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and as additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves may affect the Groups financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following: asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows: depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the unit of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change: decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities: and 118 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 118 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax benefits.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being revised.
For property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, the appropriateness of the assets useful economic life is reviewed at least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Employee benefits The expected costs of providing long-term employment benefits under defined benefit arrangements relating to employee service during the period are determined based on financial and actuarial assumptions.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set in consultation with an independent actuary.
Kazakh legislation requires that the amounts payable for death and disability benefits are linked to future salary increases.
As a result, future salary increases within the business have to be estimated.
Other key assumptions include the selection of discount and mortality rates.
The discount rate used was determined by reference to the 10-year Kazakhstan Government euro-dollar bonds issued in 2014 adjusted for currency conversion to KZT.
The 10-year bond rate approximates to the average maturity profile of the Groups benefit obligations.
Mortality rates are based on the official mortality table of Kazakhstan published by the Government.
While the Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would impact the employee benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet and hence the financial performance of the Group.
This obligation predominantly arises within the Disposal Assets, which were disposed of on 31 October 2014.
The obligation that remains with the continuing operations is significantly smaller and therefore any changes in the above assumptions are unlikely to have a material impact on the Groups balance sheet.
Income taxes In determining the level of accruals and provisions to be recognised in respect of any potential exposures for various tax liabilities, the Directors make estimates in relation to the level of taxes payable, particularly in relation to transfer pricing, non-deductible items and outcomes of tax disputes.
The tax obligations, upon audit by the tax authorities at a future date, may differ as a result of differing interpretations.
These differences may also impact the level of accruals and provisions recognised.
Segment information Information provided to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group.
For management and operational purposes, the Group is organised into three separate businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their operations, end-products and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
The Restructuring undertaken by the Group in 2014 has resulted in a change in the Groups operating segments.
As the Disposal Assets were classified as a discontinued operation at 15 August 2014 with the comparatives restated to conform to this presentation, the operating segment disclosures for the year ended 31 December 2013 have also been restated to reflect this classification.
The Groups updated operating segments following the Restructuring are: East Region operations The East Region operations business is managed as one operating segment and comprises: the Groups main operating entity, Vostoktsvetmet LLC, whose principal activity is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products: and the Groups UK trading function, KAZ Minerals Sales Limited, which is responsible for the purchase of exported products from Vostoktsvetmet LLC and subsequently applies an appropriate mark-up prior to onward sale to third parties.
The UK entity is a sales function on behalf of the East Region operations business and consequently the assets and liabilities related to those trading operations, i. e. trade payables and trade receivables, are included within the East Region operations operating segment.
Mining Projects The Groups project companies, whose responsibility is the development of the Groups major growth projects Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay.
Bozymchak The Bozymchak gold-copper deposit, which is located in Kyrgyzstan, is at the commissioning phase and is managed and reported on as a separate operating segment.
Managing and measuring operating segments The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items, which is defined as operating profit adjusted to remove depreciation, depletion, amortisation, the non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation, MET and special items.
Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business see notes 5 and 14. www.

For the year ended 31 December 2013, discontinued operations comprised the results of Disposal Assets, the results of MKM for the period up to 28 May 2013, the date on which it was sold, the share of post-tax results from the Groups investment in Ekibastuz GRES-1 up to 5 December 2013 and the share of post-tax results from the Groups investment in ENRC up to 24 June 2013.
2 On 31 October 2014, the Group sold the Disposal Assets recognising a loss on disposal of $2,273 million see note 13 a.
In addition, on 1 April 2014 the Group completed the sale of the Groups investment in Ekibastuz GRES-1 joint venture and Kaz Hydro recognising a gain on disposal of $207 million see note 13 b.
3 The non-cash component of the Groups disability benefits obligation has been excluded from EBITDA, a key financial indicator, as EBITDA is a proxy for cash earnings from current trading performance.
The non-cash component of the disability benefits obligation is determined as the actuarial remeasurement charge recognised in the income statement less the actual cash payments disbursed during the year in respect of the disability benefits obligation.
4 MET has been excluded from the key financial indicator of EBITDA.
The Directors believe that MET is a substitute for a tax on profits, hence its exclusion provides a more informed measure of the operational performance of the Group.
5 Following the restatement of the Groups 2013 income statement to reflect the Disposal Assets as discontinued operations, intersegment rechargeable costs of $30 million were reallocated from the previous Kazakhmys Mining segment within the Disposal Assets, to Corporate Services within the continuing operations.
6 On 28 May 2013, the Group sold its German subsidiary, MKM, recognising a loss on disposal of $1 million see note 13 c. In addition, on 8 November 2013 the Group completed the sale of the Groups investment in ENRC recognising a loss on disposal of $528 million see note 13 d. Loss on disposal of assets includes $14 million relating to the disposal of property, plant and equipment see note 14 h. 7 Shown net of taxes.

A reconciliation of the income tax expense applicable to the accounting loss profit before tax at the statutory income tax rate to the income tax expense at the effective income tax rate for continuing operations is as follows: $ million 2014 2013 Loss profit before tax from continuing operations 169 138 1 At UK statutory income tax rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% 36 32 Under over provided in prior periods current income tax 1 11 Over under provided in prior periods deferred income tax 4 7 Tax losses 8 Effect of domestic tax rates applicable to individual Group entities 20 9 Non-deductible items: Transfer pricing 2 Net foreign exchange loss arising on the devaluation of the tenge 48 5 Other non-deductible expenses 36 14 65 48 1 For 2014, the UK statutory rate for January to March 2014 was 23.0% and for April to December 2014 was 21.0%, giving a weighted average full year rate of 21.5%.
For 2013, the UK statutory rate for January to March 2013 was 24.0% and for April to December 2013 was 23.0%, giving a weighted average full year rate of 23.25%.
Corporate income tax CIT is calculated at 21.5% 2013: 23.25% of the assessable profit for the year for the Company and its UK subsidiaries, 20.0% for the operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan 2013: 20.0% and 10.0% for the Groups Kyrgyzstan based subsidiary 2013: 10.0%.
Effective tax rate Tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The lower CIT rate in Kazakhstan will have the effect of lowering the Groups overall effective tax rate below the current UK statutory corporate tax rate.
The impact of transfer pricing provisions and non-deductible items, including impairment losses, will increase the Groups overall effective tax rate.
The following factors impact the effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2014: Tax losses During 2014, there was no utilisation of tax losses.
In 2013, the continuing operations incurred tax losses during the year, primarily related to certain subsoil use contracts, which were not expected to generate sufficient taxable profits for these losses to be utilised in the foreseeable future.
As a result, deferred tax assets of $8 million in respect of these losses were not recognised.
Transfer pricing Notwithstanding recent changes to Kazakhstans transfer pricing legislation to closer align it with international trading practices, inconsistencies still arise between the transfer pricing requirements in Kazakhstan and the UK.
However, these inconsistencies have been minimised based on the current contracts, such that no transfer pricing provision was necessary at 31 December 2014 2013: $2 million.
Other non-deductible expenses Includes the $13 million tax impact of the impairment charges recognised at Bozymchak and other non-deductible expenses within East Region operations, Mining Projects, Bozymchak and in the UK of $23 million 2013: $14 million.

These losses can be utilised against future taxable profits within the statute of limitations period, which for tax losses is currently five years.
The recent impairment attributed to Bozymchak indicates that utilisation of these losses may extend beyond the five year period and were not recognised.
ii United Kingdom Certain companies in the UK have tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits in these companies.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
There is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these companies against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Discontinued operations and assets held for sale continued g Impairment losses Year ended 31 December 2014 Disposal Assets During 2014, the Disposal Assets wrote off $15 million relating to equipment which was no longer in use and impaired stripping costs where the mine is not expected to generate any future benefits.
Year ended 31 December 2013 Disposal Assets Zhezkazgan Region cash generating unit CGU impairment review In light of the lower prices of commodities produced by the Group and inflationary pressures on operating costs, the Group commenced an optimisation programme and asset review which has resulted in operating cost and capital expenditure savings.
The asset review considered the results of the optimisation programme, and the potential for future savings, when assessing the future economic outlook for assets.
The prospects for the Zhezkazgan Region, a CGU within the former Kazakhmys Mining segment, were considered challenging.
The recoverable amount of the Zhezkazgan Region cash generating unit was believed by management to be significantly lower than its carrying value such that an impairment charge of $575 million was recognised, including $98 million of deferred taxes written off.
The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the Zhezkazgan CGU to nil.
The recoverable amount of the Zhezkazgan Region was determined based on the fair value less costs to sell calculations using the cash flows expected to be generated from existing operations and certain development projects, in particular Zhomart II.
Cash flows were projected for periods up to the date that mining, refining and power generation was expected to cease based on managements current expectations.
For current operations, the completion dates were based on recent assessments of the reserves and resources available and annual ore extraction rates.
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations were: Recoverable amount of reserves and resources Economically recoverable reserves and resources were based on managements expectations and the technical studies and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by in-house and third party specialists.
Commodity prices Long-term commodity prices assumed fall within the range of external market analyst consensus.
Operating costs Variable operating costs were included in the impairment test as a function of the related production volumes.
Fixed costs at the mines, concentrators and smelters were largely constant but reflect material changes in activity levels.
Discount rate A discount rate of 16% was used in the recoverable amount calculations, which represents the pre-tax rate that reflected the Groups current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Timing of capital expenditure Management estimated the timing of capital expenditure on the development projects based on the Groups current and future financing plans and the results of technical studies completed to date.
Inflation and exchange rates These were based on a combination of externally sourced forecasts and rates determined from information available in the market after considering long-term market expectations.
The calculation of the fair value less costs to sell of the Groups CGUs for the impairment review at 31 December 2013 provided a range of outcomes as the calculation was particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, operating cost inflation, capital expenditure and the discount rate used.
Any changes to the assumptions adopted in the calculation of the fair value less costs to sell, individually or in aggregate, would have resulted in a different valuation being determined.
Impairment charges against property, plant and equipment The impairment charges recognised against property, plant and equipment included $325 million related to the impairment of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU, the impairment of certain production assets during the year, principally the Zhezkazgan smelter, Satpayev concentrator and associated assets of $115 million and a number of mid-sized projects that were suspended during the year of $33 million.
Impairment charges against mining assets The Zhezkazgan Region CGUs mining assets were impaired by $139 million and certain mid-sized projects were impaired by $5 million as these were suspended during the year.
Inventories An impairment charge of $4 million related to specialised consumable inventories at the suspended Zhezkazgan smelter.
Other assets The impairment of other assets of $32 million related mainly to the allocation of the impairment charge recognised in respect of the Zhezkazgan Region CGU, as discussed above, in accordance with IAS 36 on a proportionate basis.
MKM In 2013, MKM was impaired by $22 million to write it down to its fair value less costs to sell.
Of the total impairment charges recognised at MKM in the year ended 31 December 2013 for the period until 28 May 2013 when it was disposed of, $1 million relates to the impairment of receivables which are not treated as special items.

The funds attracted interest at US$ LIBOR plus 2.80%.
The facility had a final maturity date of December 2017 and monthly loan repayments of principal due to commence in January 2015.
On 27 December 2013, the facility was reduced to $500 million, being the amount drawn at the end of the availability period.
Following the amendment signed in October 2014, this facility was fully repaid.
On 29 October 2014, the Group signed an amendment to the PXF debt facility.
The amended facility restates the existing PXF facility signed in December 2012 which contained certain disposal and other restrictions meaning the facility could not continue after completion of the Restructuring.
At signing, commitments from the existing syndicate of lending banks totalled $334 million and a net payment of $166 million paid to exiting banks.
The amended facility contains an accordion feature which will enable existing lenders to increase their commitments, or new lenders to join, up to a maximum total facility amount of $500 million.
On 5 December 2014, the facility was increased to $349 million.
Under the facility, principal repayments amortise in equal monthly instalments over a three year period commencing from January 2016 until final maturity on 31 December 2018.
The margin payable on the amended facility is variable, ranging from 3.0% to 4.5% above US$ LIBOR, dependent on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA which will be tested semi-annually.
KAZ Minerals PLC, Vostoktsvetmet LLC and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited act as guarantors of the loan.
The amended facility resulted in certain changes to the covenant package including the suspension of the net debt to EBITDA ratio covenant, until 1 July 2016, and changes to the balance sheet gearing covenants to make these more aligned to the Groups projected financial profile until completion of the Bozshakol major growth project.
At 31 December 2014, $344 million 2013: $500 million was drawn under the facility agreements.
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 31 December 2014 of $5 million 2013: $14 million, gross cost before amortisation of $5 million 2013: $18 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
For accounting purposes the amendments, which were considered significant, resulted in the settlement of the facility signed on 20 December 2012, with $10 million of previously unamortised costs being expensed in full.
China Development Bank and Samruk-Kazyna financing facilities On 30 December 2009, KAZ Minerals announced that it had secured a $2.7 billion financing line with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna, allocated from a $3.0 billion financing line agreed between CDB and Samruk-Kazyna.
Of the $2.7 billion secured for the Group, facility agreements were signed for $2.1 billion on 30 December 2009, and for a further $200 million on 12 January 2010, for the development of the Groups projects at Bozshakol and Bozymchak and other development projects, and two facility agreements for $200 million each, allocated to the Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects, were signed on 11 June 2012.
Samruk-Kazyna has separately signed an agreement for $300 million of the $3.0 billion to be used elsewhere and not for the benefit of the Group, which was subsequently repaid to CDB by Samruk-Kazyna in January 2013.
As part of this financing package, the Company, along with a subsidiary of SamrukKazyna, provided a guarantee in favour of CDB in respect of Samruk-Kazynas obligations under the $2.7 billion financing line.
The funds, which were fully drawn in January 2013, attract interest semi-annually at an annualised rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.80%.
The loans have a final maturity falling between January 2022 and August 2025 and the first repayment commenced in January 2013.
In January 2014, the Group repaid $400 million under this facility related to the Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects as development of these projects is not expected to commence in the near future.
On 30 December 2014, the Group announced an amendment to these facilities, which resulted in the facilities becoming bilateral between KAZ Minerals and CDB and a lowering of the interest rate from US$ LIBOR plus 4.80% to US$ LIBOR plus 4.50%.
An arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% is payable in January 2016.
Repayment of the previous facilities with Samruk-Kazyna and drawing of the new facilities directly from CDB is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2015.
All other material terms of the facilities, including the final maturity, remain unchanged.

Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 31 December 2014 of $30 million 2013: $25 million, gross cost before amortisation of $35 million 2013: $43 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
China Development Bank Aktogay finance facility On 16 December 2011, the Group signed a $1.5 billion loan facility with CDB, to be used for the development of the major copper project at Aktogay.
The loan facility consists of two separate agreements with similar terms and conditions.
The first agreement is for up to $1.3 billion and the second agreement for up to CNY1.0 billion $161 million equivalent at the CNY US$ exchange rate on 31 December 2014.
The US dollar agreement attracts interest at US$ LIBOR plus 4.20% and the RMB agreement attracts interest at the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China.
KAZ Minerals PLC acts as guarantor of the loan.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had drawn down CNY697 million $112 million 2013: CNY350 million $57 million under the RMB facility.
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost of $1 million 2013: $0.6 million, gross cost before amortisation of $1.2 million 2013: $0.8 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
In order to protect the Group from currency risks arising on this CNY denominated debt, the Group has entered into a CNY US$ cross currency swap during the year.
This derivative instrument provides a hedge against any movement in the CNY exchange rate against the US dollar and also swaps the interest basis from a CNY interest rate into a US$ LIBOR interest basis.
The fair value of the swap at 31 December 2014, included within payables, is $3 million.
At 31 December 2014, $580 million was drawn down under the USD facility.
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost of $10 million, gross cost before amortisation of $11 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.

Employee benefits Vostoktsvetmet LLC and Kazakhmys LLC until its disposal on 31 October 2014 provide post-retirement benefits and other long-term benefits in Kazakhstan which are unfunded.
The largest portion of the employee benefits provision is for other long-term benefits, of which the most significant is for the long-term disability allowances.
The other benefits provided include one-time retirement grants, financial aid, dental care, medical benefits, sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners and funeral aid.
The amounts recognised in the income statements are as follows: $ million 2014 2013 Employers share of current service cost 1 Employers share of past service cost 1 3 Actuarial losses recognised in the period 4 3 Interest cost on benefits obligation 1 1 Income statement charge attributable to continuing operations 4 8 Income statement charge attributable to discontinued operations 64 195 68 203 In accordance with Kazakhstan law, the Group obtained insurance cover for the disability payments to employees from February 2005.
The disability payments that were covered by insurance contracts were accounted for under IAS 19 Employee benefits as an insured benefit, with no asset or liability being recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
During 2013, as a result of financial difficulties, the insurance companies ceased making their obligated payments to the employees covered by insurance contracts and the Group agreed to meet these future disability payments.
Consequently at 31 December 2013, the liability for the future disability benefit payments to the employees previously covered by the insurance contracts was included in the disability benefits obligation.

Financial risk management The financial information disclosed in the tables relating to the year ended 31 December 2014 represents continuing operations only.
The 2013 comparative amounts include the Disposal Assets which were classified as assets held for sale and a discontinued operation from 15 August 2014 and were sold on 31 October 2014.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Groups Treasury department in close cooperation with the Groups business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Groups cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of treasury counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and the financial exposures facing the Group.
The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee and the Groups Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis.
The Groups Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Groups strategy, progress on the Groups financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivatives used for risk management purposes.
The Groups borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are controlled and managed centrally by the Groups Treasury department.
Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan is only held for working capital purposes.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 37. a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates.
The Groups philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams.
In periods of significant market volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility and any negative impact on its operating cash flows.
Limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal controls.
b Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities by categories are as follows: 4 $ million Notes 2014 2013 1 Loans and receivables 20,23,24,25 2,299 2,584 2 Available for sale assets 20 19 3 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 27,29,31 3,507 3,669 1 Loans and receivables comprise long-term deposits within other non-current investments see note 20, trade and other receivables, current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
2 Available for sale assets comprise unlisted investments within other non-current investments see note 20.
3 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise borrowings, provision for cash payments payments for licences and trade and other payables excluding payments received in advance, other taxes payable and MET payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
4 Includes the Disposal Assets which were classified as assets held for sale and a discontinued operation from 15 August 2014. c Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by a Group company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of the Kazakh entities within the Group is the Kazakhstan tenge, of the Bozymchak project in Kyrgyzstan is the Kyrgyz som and of KAZ Minerals Services Limited, UK sterling.
The Company, the Groups financing and holding companies and also the sales entity of East Region operations KAZ Minerals Sales Limited have US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar based revenues and certain costs, bank deposits and trade receivables of Vostoktsvetmet LLC and certain intercompany funding balances that exist within the Group.
Where possible, the Group attempts to conduct its business, maintain its monetary assets and seeks to source corporate debt capital in US dollars so as to minimise its exposure to other currencies.
The Group retains surplus cash balances in US dollars for capital expenditure, acquisitions and returns to shareholders.
Working capital balances are maintained in a mix of US dollars and local currencies depending on the short-term requirements of the business.
Whilst there is a strong correlation between many mining input costs and the US dollar, a significant portion of the mining business operating costs are denominated in local currencies, particularly the Kazakhstan tenge.
Rates of exchange for these currencies relative to the US dollar could fluctuate significantly and may materially impact the profitability of the underlying operations and the net assets of the Group.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
From time to time, acquisitions and capital investments may expose the Group to movements in other currencies and the Group will consider hedging such exposures on a case by case basis.

i Foreign currency exposure by company profile The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany amounts indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.

This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013: Impact on profit $ million 2014 2013 KZT 198 126 Euro UK sterling CNY A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
d Commodity price risk The Groups mining revenues and earnings are directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups principal commodities copper, zinc, gold and silver are priced via reference to global metal exchanges, upon which pricing is derived from global demand and supply and influenced by macroeconomic considerations and financial investment cash flows.
The pricing of the Groups principal commodities may also include a pre-determined margin or discount depending on the terms of sales contracts.
Commodity prices, particularly those derived from global metal exchanges, may fluctuate significantly and may have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
Management closely monitors the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on the business and uses conservative pricing assumptions and sensitivity analysis for its forecasting and investment appraisals.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2014.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
A 10% increase decrease in commodity prices after the period end would have no impact on loss profit after tax 2013: $nil.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant and was performed on the same basis as 2013. e Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates primarily impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows floating rate debt or their fair value fixed rate debt and deposits.
The Groups interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
A limited amount of fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had outstanding interest rate swaps on the CDB Aktogay facility of $3 million 2013: $nil.
At 31 December 2014 and 2013 all borrowings were at floating rates.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 December 2014 Noninterest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Non-current investments 1 1 Trade and other receivables 168 168 Current investments 400 400 Cash and cash equivalents 941 750 39 1,730 Total financial assets 941 1,151 207 2,299 Financial liabilities Provisions for cash payments 11 11 Borrowings 3,092 3,092 1 Trade and other payables 404 404 Total financial liabilities 3,092 11 404 3,507 www.

2 Includes the Disposal Assets which were classified as assets held for sale and a discontinued operation from 15 August 2014.
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate such as LIBOR.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2014.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time.
The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year-end net debt position and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $16 million 2013: $20 million.
f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and commitments due from third parties.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor the distribution of these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Given the number and geographical spread of the Groups ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited in respect of trade receivables.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Customer credit risk is managed by each division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each divisions customer credit risk management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner.
Credit evaluations are performed for all major customers and credit limits are established based on internal or external rating criteria.
The credit quality of the Groups significant customers is monitored on an ongoing basis, and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality.
Letters of credit are obtained where customer credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit.
There were no material impairments of trade receivables during the year ended 31 December 2014 or 2013.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
Within East Region operations, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are predominantly made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
For all sales made to Chinese customers without letters of credit, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Payment from European and Chinese customers is subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
East Region operations is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material in the context of the Groups overall revenues.
East Region operations also provides certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of past payment history.
As at 31 December 2014, 10 2013: 10 customers accounted for 86% 2013: 87% of the trade and other receivables balance of East Region operations.
By 23 February 2015, 100% 24 February 2014: 100% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.

Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
The Groups cash management policies emphasise security and liquidity ahead of investment return.
Investment of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Exposures are measured against maximum credit limits assigned to each approved counterparty to ensure credit risk is effectively managed.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes.
The Group must maintain a level of cash and deposits in Kazakhstan with local branches of international financial institutions and well-established local Kazakhstan banks.
The surplus funds in the UK are held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and AAA rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments.

Financial risk management continued g Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of liquid cash investments and debt facilities of varying maturities.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
The Groups policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities, which will be settled on a gross basis, into relevant maturity groups based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

152 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 152 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS h Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
2 2014 2013 Carrying Carrying $ million value Fair value value Fair value Non-current investments 1 1 28 28 Trade and other receivables 168 168 235 235 Current investments 400 400 625 625 Cash and cash equivalents 1,730 1,730 1,715 1,715 Provisions for cash payments 11 11 36 36 Borrowings 3,092 3,119 3,111 3,133 1 Trade and other payables 404 404 522 522 1,208 1,235 1,066 1,088 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and MET payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and dividends payable approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments: provisions for cash payments are discounted back to their present value: and the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar maturities.
i Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders either through dividends or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2014, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $5,196 million, compared to $7,332 million at 31 December 2013.
Total capital employed is the measure of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
At 31 December 2014, the Group is in a net debt position from continuing operations of $962 million 2013: $771 million.
The Group does not have a target debt equity ratio, but has determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term normalised EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle.
This ratio is reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle, where normalised EBITDA excludes special items.
Included within the debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity ratios, minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
There are no covenants under negotiation at present.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, which may crystallise a financial loss for the Group.
b Kazakhstan taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
Kazakhstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
The Directors interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial performance or position.
com 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 34.
Commitments and contingencies continued ii Tax audits Historical tax years relating to various Companies with the Group remain open for inspection during a future tax audit.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
iii Transfer pricing The Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation provides clarity on various aspects of transfer pricing, including the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Notwithstanding these amendments, the Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors interpretation of the transfer pricing legislation and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities.
The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors expectations.
iv Period for additional tax assessments The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax.
In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
v Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law.
The resulting effect of any positions taken by the tax authorities that differ from those of the Directors is that additional tax liabilities may arise.
However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
c Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving and new emissions legislation is expected to be introduced in the near future.
The outcome of environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements, however recognise that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of environmental legislation.
The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise, however due to the range of uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 29, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
d Use of subsoil and exploration rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Investments and Development the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2062. e Capital expenditure commitments The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its mining subsoil agreements.
Committed expenditure under the subsoil agreements typically relates to investments in community-related projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities.
The total commitments for property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2014 amounted to $150 million 2013: $861 million.
f Operating lease commitments The operating lease expense for the year was $5 million 2013: $4 million.
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group had the following total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases: $ million 2014 2013 Within one year 2 5 After one year but not more than five years 7 18 More than five years 4 48 13 71 154 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 154 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS g Koksay contingent consideration As part of the purchase of the Koksay mining licence, a payment of $35 million is due in July 2015, which is contingent on the confirmation of resources.
Related party disclosures a Transactions with related parties Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties, including Cuprum Holding, are disclosed below.
The following table provides the total amount of transactions which have been entered into with related parties for the relevant financial period: Amounts Amounts Sales to Purchases owed by owed to related from related related related 1 $ million parties parties parties parties Cuprum Holding and the Disposal Assets 2014 6 97 23 57 2013 Companies under trust management 2014 10 13 2013 12 6 43 6 Other 2014 4 11 2 6 2013 2 20 11 1 A provision of $nil 2013: $46 million is held set against the amounts owed by related parties.
The bad debt expense in relation to related parties was $nil for the year 2013: $10 million.
i Government Share ownership in the Company On 24 July 2008, the Company issued 80,286,050 ordinary shares to the State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Government, thereby making the Government a 15% shareholder of the Company and a related party with effect from this date.
On 4 October 2010, the Groups Chairman at that time, Vladimir Kim, sold 58,876,793 ordinary shares, approximately 11% of KAZ Minerals shares in issue, to Samruk-Kazyna.
As a result of the transaction, the Governments interest in the Group increased to 139,162,843 ordinary shares, representing approximately 26% of the shares in issue.
The Governments interest was held via the State Property and Privatisation Committee's existing 15% holding and the 11% shareholding of Samruk-Kazyna.
Following the purchase of 11,701,830 of the Companys shares under the share buy-back programme which completed in May 2012, the Governments percentage of the total voting rights held increased to 26.57% as at 31 December 2013.
On 19 June 2013, the Government transferred its entire shareholding of 26.57% to Eurasian Resources, and was considered a related party up until that date.
Eurasian Resources held 139,162,843 ordinary shares in KAZ Minerals PLC following a transfer from the Government of Kazakhstan on 19 June 2013.
As part of the settlement of the consideration under the ENRC Takeover Offer on 8 November 2013, KAZ Minerals PLC received 77,041,147 of its ordinary shares from Eurasian Resources, which were subsequently cancelled.
Following the ENRC Takeover, Eurasian Resources transferred KAZ Minerals PLC shares to the shareholders of ENRC, such that Eurasian Resources holding in KAZ Minerals PLC at 31 December 2014 is minimal less than 1%.
China Development Bank and Samruk-Kazyna financing line As explained in note 27, the Group secured a $2.7 billion financing line with Samruk-Kazyna, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government of Kazakhstan, and CDB.
The terms and conditions of the financing line, including a guarantee issued by the Group over the debt obligations of Samruk-Kazyna to CDB under the financing line, are considered to be on an arms length basis.
Up until 19 June 2013 when the Government transferred its interest in the Group, Samruk-Kazyna was also considered a related party.
Subsequent to that, both the Government and CDB were no longer considered as related parties.
In addition, in December 2014 the loan was amended to a bilateral facility between CDB and KAZ Minerals PLC.
com 155 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 35.
Related party disclosures continued Other transactions In the normal course of business, the Group conducts transactions with entities controlled by the Government.
The principal activities relate to the payment of electricity transmission fees, use of railway infrastructure and payments to tax authorities.
In addition, the Group also constructs or pays for the construction of community assets and projects which may be transferred to the relevant Government department as part of the Groups social programme in Kazakhstan.
Transactions between the Group and Government departments and agencies are considered to be related party transactions.
Disclosure of these routine transactions is not made where all of the following criteria are met: they were done in the ordinary course of business of the Government department and or company: there is no choice of suppliers: and they have terms and conditions including prices, privileges, credit terms, regulations, etc.
that are consistently applied to all entities, public or private.
The Group did not have any material or significant non-arms length or privileged transactions with entities controlled by the Government 2013: $nil.
Dividend payment No dividends were paid in 2014, the Governments share of the final 2012 dividend paid by the Company on 21 May 2013 was $11 million.
ii Cuprum Holding and the Disposal Assets Following the completion of the sale of the Disposal Assets to Cuprum Holding a company owned by Vladimir Kim, a Director of the Company, and Eduard Ogay, a former Director of the Company on 31 October 2014, Cuprum Holding and its subsidiaries are considered related parties of the Group.
The transactions mainly consist of transitional and longer-term services provided under two Framework Services Agreements between KAZ Minerals and Cuprum Holding.
The Framework Services Agreements cover certain functions such as smelting and refining.
For the 10 months until 31 October 2014, the date the Disposal Assets were sold, the Group paid $2.4 million in remuneration to key management personnel of the Disposal Assets.
These individuals were previously considered to be key management personnel of the Group prior to the completion of the Restructuring.
iii Companies under trust management agreements The Group operates a number of companies under trust management agreements with local and state authorities.
The activities include heating distribution systems and road maintenance.
The purpose of these agreements is to provide public and social services without any material financial benefit for the Group.
iv Other Transactions with other companies primarily relate to the provision of goods and services, on an arms length basis, with companies whose boards or shareholders include members of senior management from the Groups subsidiaries.
b Terms and conditions of transactions with related parties Prices for related party transactions are determined by the parties on an ongoing basis depending on the nature of the transaction.
Share-based payment plans The Companys share-based payment plans consist of a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2014 arising from these plans was $5 million 2013: $5 million.
The total number of shares outstanding under these schemes as at 31 December 2014 was 3,653,331 2013: 2,567,348.
The total number of shares exercisable under these schemes as at 31 December 2014 was 258,580 2013: 168,966.
These plans are discretionary benefits offered by the Company for the benefit of its employees.
The main purpose is to increase the interest of the employees in KAZ Minerals long-term business goals and performance through share ownership.
They represent incentives for employees' future performance and commitment to be aligned to the goals of the Group.
The shares issued under these plans are dilutive ordinary shares.
For any future awards, the Company may issue new shares rather than purchase the shares in the open market through the Employee Benefit Trust.

Summary of significant accounting policies The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group.
a Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
The functional currency of the Company, the Groups financing and holding companies and KAZ Minerals Sales Limited is the US dollar $ as the majority of the operating activities are conducted in US dollars.
The functional currency of the Groups Kazakh entities is the Kazakhstan tenge KZT, with the Bozymchak project being the Kyrgyz som KGS.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate component of equity.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 Spot Average Spot Average Kazakhstan tenge 182.35 179.19 153.61 152.13 Kyrgyz som 58.89 53.64 49.25 48.44 Euro 0.82 0.75 0.75 0.73 UK pounds sterling 0.64 0.61 0.61 0.64 b Business combinations The Group applies the purchase method to account for business combinations.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable net assets on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Those mining rights, mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
The consideration transferred cost of acquisition is the aggregate of: a the fair values at the date of exchange, of assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group: and b the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in the income statement.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
If the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified and measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.
If that excess remains after reassessment, the Group recognises the resulting gain in the income statement on the acquisition date.
When a subsidiary is acquired in a number of stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the income statement.
Similar procedures are applied in accounting for the purchases of interests in associates and joint ventures.
Any goodwill arising on such purchases is included within the carrying amount of the investment in the associate, but not thereafter amortised.
Any excess of the Groups share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the investment is included in the income statement in the period of the purchase.
c Intangible assets i Non-mining intangible assets Non-mining intangible assets relate largely to software purchases, which are acquired by the Group and which have finite useful lives, and are stated at cost which comprises purchase price plus any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for intended use less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value which can be measured reliably as at the date of acquisition.
ii Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets, which have expected useful lives of three to 10 years, is computed under the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
com 157 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 37.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued d Property, plant and equipment i Initial measurement Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
ii Depreciation The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset or on a unit of production basis depending on the type of asset.
The unit of production method is the ratio of commodity production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves over the life of the mine using proven and probable mineral reserves as determined by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2012 JORC Code on an annual basis based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are used within the business.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15-40 years Plant and equipment 4-25 years Other 3-15 years iii Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
iv Repairs and maintenance Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised with the carrying amount of the replaced component being written off.
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is capitalised if additional future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
v Leased assets Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
e Mining assets i Mineral licences and properties Costs of acquiring mineral licences and properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Costs associated with a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period development expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral licences and properties are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
ii Mine development costs Mine development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves or mineral-bearing ore deposits and to provide facilities for extracting, lifting and storing minerals.
Such costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
iii Mine stripping costs Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mines production phase is deferred if the stripping activity permits an increase in the output of the mine in future periods through providing access to additional sources of reserves that will be produced in future periods.
Capitalised stripping costs are amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity.
158 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 158 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS iv Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest once the legal right to explore has been acquired, other than that acquired through a purchase transaction, is carried forward as an asset, within mining assets, provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale: exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off.
Administrative and general expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase transaction are recognised as assets at their cost, or fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Exploration and evaluation assets attributable to producing interests are amortised over the remaining life of the mine on a unit of production basis.
f Impairment The carrying values of mining assets, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment when indicators of such impairment exist.
If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the assets recoverable amount is calculated.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses related to continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
If this is the case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
ii Reversals of impairment A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in relation to goodwill are not reversed for subsequent increases in its recoverable amount.
g Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost is determined on the following bases: raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis: and work in progress and finished goods are valued at the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation, labour and overheads based on normal operating capacity.
The cost of work in progress and finished goods is based on the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
h Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value less any impairment.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised within an allowance account unless the Group considers that no recovery of the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value of the asset is reduced directly.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities less than three months at inception and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
com 159 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 37.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued j Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the assets or disposal groups are available for immediate sale in their present condition.
The Group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification.
Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount prior to being classified as held for sale, and the fair value less costs to sell.
A non-current asset is not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
A non-current asset held for sale is presented separately in the balance sheet.
The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately as one line in the assets and liabilities sections on the face of the balance sheet.
An asset or business is considered to be a discontinued operation if it has been sold or is classified as held for sale and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of either a separate major line of business or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to sale.
Once an operation has been identified as discontinued, its net profit is presented separately from continuing operations.
Comparative information is reclassified so that the net profit of the prior period is also presented separately.
k Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
l Employee benefits i Long-term employee benefits The Groups entities located in Kazakhstan remit contributions to defined contribution pension plans on behalf of its employees.
Contributions to be paid by the Group are withheld from employees salaries and are recognised as part of the salary expense in the income statement as incurred.
The Groups defined benefit plans, including the death and disability plans for current and former employees, are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised, such that the plan liabilities and assets are measured by actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value.
The discount rate is determined by reference to the US treasury bond rate adjusted for country specific inflation and risk.
The treasury bond used approximates to the average maturity profile of the Groups benefit obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified independent actuary.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise for defined benefit plans not considered to be other long-term employee benefits.
In respect of other long-term employee benefit plans, namely the Groups disability benefits obligation, all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
The expense in relation to all long-term employee benefits is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to the period of service of the employees.
ii Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with marketrelated vesting conditions is determined using the Monte Carlo method and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
m Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired either by the Employee Benefit Trust for the purposes of the Groups employee sharebased payment plans or by the Company as part of any share buy-back programmes are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
n Trust activities Assets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions entered into with these trust activities are expensed in the consolidated financial statements.
o Social responsibility costs The Group is obliged to contribute towards social programmes for the benefit of the local community at large.
The Groups contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the income statement at the point when the Group is committed to the expenditure.
160 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 160 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS p Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
i Site restoration costs Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
Over time, the discounted provision is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over the remaining life of the mine to which it relates, using a unit of production method.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
Any change in restoration costs or assumptions will be recognised as additions or charges to the corresponding asset and provision when they occur.
For permanently closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Payments for licences In accordance with the terms of subsoil use contracts, provision is made for future licence payments when the Group has a present obligation to repay the costs of geological information provided for licensed deposits.
The amount payable is discounted to its present value.
iii Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources and for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
q Revenue Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties during the year.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax.
MET is included within cost of sales.
All revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue associated with the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title and any insurance risk has passed to the customer and the goods have been delivered in accordance with the contractual delivery terms or when any services have been provided.
Almost all sales agreements for copper cathodes, copper rods and copper and zinc concentrate are provisionally priced i. e. the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotation period, typically the average price either for the month or the month following delivery to the customer, based on the LME market price for the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract.
Such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is not required to be separated from the underlying host contact, being the sale of the commodity.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal sales are marked-to-market using forward prices, with adjustments both gains and losses being recorded in revenue in the income statement and in trade receivables or trade payables in the balance sheet.
r Finance income Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
s Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings which are not capitalised under the borrowing costs policy see 2 u below, the unwinding of interest cost on provisions and foreign exchange losses.
t Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are considered substantially ready for their intended use, i. e. when they are capable of commercial production.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available for a short term from money borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the year.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred using the effective interest rate method.
com 161 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Year ended 31 December 2014 37.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Borrowing costs that represent avoidable costs not related to the financing arrangements of the development projects and are therefore not directly attributable to the construction of these respective assets are expensed in the period as incurred.
These borrowing costs generally arise where the funds are drawn down under the Groups financing facilities, whether specific or general, which are in excess of the near-term cash flow requirements of the development projects for which the financing is intended, and the funds are drawn down ahead of any contractual obligation to do so.
u Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Excess profits tax is treated as income tax and forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
v Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
w Financial instruments The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the income statement.
The Groups financial assets include cash and short-term investments, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted and unquoted investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups most significant financial assets, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
These are typically loans and receivables created by the Group in providing money to a debtor.
Subsequent measurement After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income statement.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
162 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 162 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ii Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups most significant financial liabilities, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after initial recognition.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
iii Derivative financial instruments Where the Group enters into derivative contracts that are not hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39, these are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance income or finance costs in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would have been expected.
iv Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is an enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
v Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured is provided in note 33. www.

Company financial statements continued d Company accounting policies Basis of preparation The KAZ Minerals PLC parent company balance sheet, statement of cash flows and related notes have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency adopted is US dollars.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements refer to notes 2 and 37 except for the additional accounting policy relating to non-current investments set out below.
There were no changes to the accounting policies during the year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, following implementation of these standards, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Non-current investments Non-current investments are held at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

The impairment charge arises as the holding company of the Disposal Assets sold the respective companies for nil proceeds.
ii KAZ Minerals Services Limited In 2014, an additional investment of $2 million 2013: $3 million relating to capital contributions made by the Company to KAZ Minerals Services Limited was recognised in respect of the share awards issued by the Company on behalf of employees of KAZ Minerals Services Limited.
iii KAZ Minerals Finance PLC During 2014, the Company waived $150 million of the intercompany loan receivable due from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC as a capital contribution to KAZ Minerals Finance PLC.
iv ENRC The Company, via an intermediate holding company, held 334,824,860 shares in ENRC representing 26.0% of the issued share capital, until its disposal on 8 November 2013. v Other companies The Company holds its interests in other subsidiaries in the Group either directly or via intermediate holding companies for those businesses in Central Asia.

This balance is repayable on demand and accrues interest at US$ LIBOR minus 10 bps.
As at 31 December 2014, interest receivable of $3 million 2013: $3 million had accrued on this loan balance and is included within intercompany receivables note 38 g. 166 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 166 KAZ Minerals Annual Report & Accounts 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS g Company trade and other receivables $ million 2014 2013 Intercompany receivables 3 3 Group tax relief receivables 11 10 14 13 Group tax relief is due from KAZ Minerals Sales Limited of $11 million 2013: $10 million as all UK Group companies are considered part of a tax group for corporation tax purposes.

Consequently, the cost of these shares previously treated as a loan advanced to the Employee Benefit Trust has been reclassified to the treasury shares reserve within equity.
i Capital reserve The capital reserve is a non-distributable reserve created when the shares issued pursuant to the share exchange agreements prior to the Companys listing were recorded at fair value.
To the extent the Company received dividends from Kazakhmys LLCs profits created in the period prior to the share exchange, the capital reserve was realised through a transfer to distributable retained earnings.
Prior to the divestment of the Disposal Assets, the Company recognised an impairment charge of $3.3 billion against the carrying value of its investments see note 38 e and utilised the capital reserve, which related to Kazakhmys LLC and arose pursuant to the share exchange arrangements, to reflect part of the impairment.
ii Capital redemption reserve As a result of the share buy-back programme undertaken in 2008 and the re-purchase of KAZ Minerals PLC shares received from the ENRC disposal in 2013, transfers were made from share capital to the capital redemption reserve based on the nominal value of the shares cancelled.
iii Treasury shares The treasury shares reserve represents the cost of the Companys shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the share options awarded under the Companys share-based payment schemes.

Company financial statements continued k Company financial risk management The Company, as a holding company, has limited exposure to foreign exchange, credit and interest rate risks and these are shown below.
The Company has no exposure to commodity, liquidity or price risks.
i Foreign exchange risk The Company has transactional currency exposures principally arising from transactions relating to corporate costs which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency being the US dollar.
Corporate costs are primarily denominated in UK sterling.
The Company generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
ii Credit risk Credit risk for the Company relates to cash and cash equivalents.
Balances within intercompany loans and trade and other receivables mostly relate to amounts owed by Group undertakings resulting in reduced credit risk for these balances.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: $ million 2014 2013 Intercompany loans 184 323 Trade and other receivables 14 13 198 336 The exposure to credit risk for intercompany loans and trade and other receivables at 31 December 2014 and 2013 by geographic areas was all European.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and intercompany loans and payables approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
v Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Companys capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle, to maximise returns to shareholders either through dividends or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the Companys cost of capital see note 33 i. l Company related party disclosures i Transactions with related parties Transactions with related parties comprise interest received from KAZ Minerals Finance PLC of $0.1 million 2013: $1 million and management fees to KAZ Minerals Services Limited for services provided on behalf of the Company during the year under a management service agreement of $52 million 2013: $30 million.
The amounts outstanding from subsidiary companies are provided in notes 38 f and 38 g. The intercompany payables amount of $105 million is due to KAZ Minerals Services Limited for management fees discussed above and other services 2013: $99 million.
The balance is payable on demand and is interest free.
The Company received $50 million dividends from KAZ Minerals Sales Limited 2013: $60 million during the year.
An additional investment of $2 million relating to capital contributions was made to KAZ Minerals Services Limited during 2014 2013: $3 million see note 38 e.
