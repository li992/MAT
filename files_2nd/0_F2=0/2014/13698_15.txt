Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Significant accounting policies RPS Group Plc the Company is a company domiciled in the UK under the Companies Act.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 26 February 2015. a Basis of preparation The Group has prepared its annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the UK.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
These financial statements have been prepared using the accounting policies set out in the Report and Accounts 2014.
During the year, the Group has applied IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 as revised in 2011 Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28 as revised in 2011 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Their adoption has not had a material impact on the disclosures or amounts reported in these accounts.
Otherwise the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to both years presented in these consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
c Revenue Revenue is stated net of sales tax.
Revenue is recognised only when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
i Fees expenses Revenue is classified into Fee revenue and Expense revenue.
Fee revenue represents the Groups personnel, subcontractor and equipment time and expertise sold to clients.
Expense revenue is the revenue recognised on the recharge of costs incidental to fulfilling the Groups contracts, for example mileage, flights, subsistence and accommodation.
ii Time and materials In the case of time and materials projects, revenue represents the fair value of services provided using time spent at agreed rates as the basis.
iii Fixed price In the case of fixed price contracts, revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date measured by reference to the milestones achieved or cost incurred as a proportion of the total forecast cost.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
iv Tuition Tuition fees in respect of courses run by RPS are recognised over the period of instruction.
v Agency agreements The Group enters into certain agreements with clients where it manages client expenditure as an agent.
It is obliged to purchase third party services and recharges those costs, plus a management fee, to the client.
In these cases only the management fee is recognised as revenue.
Receivables, payables and cash related to these transactions are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Significant accounting policies continued Accrued revenue is booked as a receivable in the consolidated balance sheet when the amount of revenue recognised on a contract exceeds the amount invoiced.
Where the amount invoiced exceeds the amount of revenue recognised, the difference is booked as a payable on the balance sheet in deferred income.
d Deferred consideration Deferred consideration arises when settlement of all or part of the cost of a business combination falls due after the date the acquisition was completed.
Where the payment of deferred consideration is not contingent upon continuing employment of the vendors by the Group, deferred consideration is stated at the fair value of the total consideration outstanding.
In these cases all deferred consideration has been treated as part of the cost of investment.
At each balance sheet date deferred consideration comprises the fair value of the remaining deferred consideration valued at acquisition.
Where the payment of deferred consideration is contingent upon the continuing employment of vendors by the Group, it is treated as a remuneration expense and accounted for as an employment benefit under IAS 19.
A charge is made through the consolidated income statement as a cost of employment.
The cost associated with each payment is accrued over the period it is earned.
At each balance sheet date the contingent deferred consideration balance comprises the accrual for unsettled remuneration which has been expensed to the balance sheet date.
e Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions of subsidiaries and the business, assets and liabilities of partnerships.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets identified in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
The fair values ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in income as an expense as incurred.
iii Amortisation Amortisation is charged to profit or loss in proportion to the timing of the benefits derived from the related asset from the date that the intangible assets are available for use over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite.
The estimated useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 3 to 10 years Trade names 1 to 5 years Order backlog 1 to 4 years Non compete agreements 3 years Software 10 years Intellectual property rights 10 years 40 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts f Impairment of non financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each annual balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement unless the asset is recorded at a revalued amount in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus has previously been recorded.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
g Non statutory performance measures The Board uses six non statutory performance measures.
These are Operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs, Profit before tax, amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs, Adjusted basic earnings per share, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Segment profit and Underlying profit.
The Board considers these to be more reflective of the way the business is managed than the statutory measures Operating profit, Profit before tax, Basic earnings per share and Diluted earnings per share.
Segment profit is defined as profit before interest, tax, amortisation of acquired intangibles, transaction related costs and unallocated expenses.
Underlying profit is defined as segment profit before reorganisation costs.
i Amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs note 4 This classification of income and expense comprises amortisation of acquired intangibles see note 1 e iii, deferred consideration payments that are contingent on continuing employment and are treated as remuneration see note 1 d, and third party transaction related costs.
ii Reorganisation costs This classification of income and expense comprises costs arising as a consequence of reorganisation including redundancy costs, the costs of consolidating office space and rebranding costs.
An explanation of adjusted earning per share is given in note 10. h Key accounting estimates and judgements The Group considers that the accounting policies above all require judgement to be exercised.
Judgements that could have a material effect on the Groups financial statements include the following: 1.
Revenue recognition judgement is required to identify when it is appropriate to recognise revenue on contracts, particularly with respect to fixed price contracts.
Acquisition accounting judgements are made with respect to the fair value of the net assets acquired.
See note 28 for details of the acquisitions completed in 2014.
Impairment of non-financial assets when impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are undertaken, judgements are made with respect to the discount rates applicable to the Groups cash generating units, along with the expected cash flows of those cash generating units and the growth rates applied to them.
Detail of the results of the impairment reviews performed in 2014 can be found in note 11 along with the judgements applied.
com 41 Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Impairment of financial assets management considers in detail when it is appropriate to recognise impairment reserves against specific financial assets including debtors and accrued income.
This judgement will take into account our previous experience with the client in question, their particular circumstances and the markets that they work in.
Details of the impairment reserves held for financial assets can be found in note 14.
Other accounting policies a Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in income.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
They are recycled and taken to income upon disposal of the operation.
iv Foreign currency forward contracts Foreign currency forward contracts are initially recognised at nil value, being priced-at-the-money at origination.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value determined by price changes in the underlying forward rate, the interest rate, the time to expiration of the contract and the amount of foreign currency specified in the contract.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
b Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy 1 f above.
ii Leased assets Leases which contain terms whereby the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases.
Assets acquired under a finance lease are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value of the leased assets, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities net of finance costs allocated to future periods.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalised.
iii Subsequent costs The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
42 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts iv Depreciation Depreciation is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Alterations to leasehold premises Life of lease Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures, fittings, IT and equipment 3 to 8 years c Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at cost and carried at cost less impairment losses.
Trade and other receivables are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses are taken to the income statement as incurred.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement.
e Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the Statement of Comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
These remeasurement gains and losses are not recycled to the income statement.
Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements recognised in administrative expenses net interest expense or income recognised in finance costs : and remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the deficit in the Groups defined benefit scheme.
iii Share-based payments The Group operates share based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity settled awards for share based payments is determined at grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The Group has calculated the fair market value of options using a binomial model and for whole share awards the fair value has been based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant adjusted to take into account some of the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted.
Those fair values were charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting period adjusted to reflect actual and expected vesting levels.
The Group also incentivises employees through the grant of conditional share awards under the bonus Banking Plan BBP for Executive Directors and other senior directors: the Performance Share Plan PSP, for senior managers and staff, and the Share Incentive Plan SIP, available to staff.
Under these arrangements shares are granted at no cost to the employee.
The release of shares granted under the BBP and PSP are subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance conditions and continuity of employment provisions.
The release of shares under the SIP are subject to continuity of employment provisions.
iv Accrued holiday pay Provision is made at each balance sheet date for holidays accrued but not taken, to the extent that they may be carried forward, calculated at the salary of the relevant employee at that date.
com 43 Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Other accounting policies continued f Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
g Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Trade payables with a short useful life are not discounted.
h Borrowings Bank overdrafts and interest bearing loans are initially measured at cost.
i Reserves The description and purpose of the Groups reserves are as follows: Share premium Premium on shares issued in excess of nominal value, other than on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.
Merger reserve Premium on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.
Employee trust Own shares held by the SIP and ESOP trusts.
Translation reserve Cumulative gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling.
Retained earnings Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of changes in equity.
j Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
k Income tax Income tax on the income for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In accordance with IAS12, deferred tax is taken directly to equity to the extent that the intrinsic value of the outstanding share awards based on the closing share price is greater than the share based payment expense already charged to the income statement.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
44 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts l Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when they are paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
m Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP As the Company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purpose of the Group accounts.
The ESOPs assets other than investments in the Companys shares, liabilities, income and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements.
The ESOPs investment in the Companys shares is deducted from shareholders funds in the Group balance sheet as if they were treasury shares.
n Accounting standards issued but not adopted At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU : n IFRS 9 Financial Instruments n lAS 1 amended Disclosure Initiatives n IFRS 10 amended, IFRS 12 amended and lAS 18 amended n lAS 16 and IAS 38 amended Depreciation and Amortisation Investment Entities n lAS 19 amended Employee Contributions n IFRS 11 amended Joint Operations n lAS 27 amended Separate Financial Statements n IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts A full assessment of the impact of these standards has not been undertaken yet.
It is not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of their impact until a detailed review has been completed.
3. Business and geographical segments Segment information is presented in the financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The business segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Business segments The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2013 were restated following the transfer of a business into the BNE North America segment from the Energy segment as noted in the Interim Management Statement issued on 1 May 2014.
The business segments of the Group are as follows: Energy - the provision of integrated technical, commercial and project management support and training in the fields of geoscience, engineering and health, safety and environment on a global basis to the energy sector.
Built and Natural Environment BNE - consultancy services to many aspects of the property and infrastructure development and management sectors.
These include: environmental assessment, the management of water resources, oceanography, health and safety, risk management, town and country planning, building, landscape and urban design, surveying and transport planning.
Consulting services are provided on a regional basis in Europe and North America.
Australia Asia Pacific AAP - In the AAP region there is a single board that manages the BNE and Energy services we provide in that region.
Accordingly the results of this business are reported as a separate segment.
Certain central costs are not allocated to the segments because either they predominantly relate to the running of the Group head office function or could only be allocated to the segments on an arbitrary basis, such costs include the remuneration and support costs of the main board and the costs of the Group finance and marketing functions.
These costs are included in the category unallocated expenses.
Segment profit and Underlying profit are defined in note 1 g rpsgroup.

The UK tax expense for the groups UK companies is 21.5% 2013: 23.25% representing the weighted average annual corporate tax rate for the full financial year.
The actual tax expense for 2014 is different from 21.5% 2013: 23.25% of profit before tax for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2014 2013 Profit before tax 46,272 43,607 Tax at the standard rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% 9,948 10,139 Effect of: Overseas tax rates 3,534 3,432 Non deductible acquisition consideration treated as remuneration 247 1,401 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 673 403 Non taxable income 755 133 Effect of change in tax rates 490 Adjustments in respect of prior years 722 235 Total tax charge on the profit for the period 12,925 14,987 The UK government has announced a future decrease in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% from April 2015.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax credit arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse.
This change was reflected in the 2013 Report and Accounts.

Earnings per share The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share were based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the related period as shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 000s 2014 2013 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 33,347 28,620 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share 219,399 218,355 Effect of employee share schemes 1,135 909 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share 220,534 219,264 Basic earnings per share pence 15.20 13.11 Diluted earnings per share pence 15.12 13.05 The directors consider that earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangible and transaction related costs provides a more meaningful measure of the Groups performance than statutory earnings per share.
The calculations of adjusted earnings per share were based on the number of shares as above and are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2014 2013 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 33,347 28,620 Amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs note 4 19,842 19,425 Tax on amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs note 9 4,838 3,889 Adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 48,351 44,156 Adjusted basic earnings per share pence 22.04 20.22 Adjusted diluted earnings per share pence 21.92 20.14 52 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts 11.
Acquisitions in 2013 were originally stated at provisional values.
These fair values have now been finalised and the tax liability on one acquisition was found to be overstated by 41,000.
No adjustments have been made to the prior year balance sheet or income statement on grounds of immateriality in accordance with IFRS 3.
As described in note 3, the 2013 results have been restated.
Accordingly goodwill has been reallocated between the Energy and BNE: North America CGU groups.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: rpsgroup.

Management have not identified any impairment triggering events in the period since the last annual review.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the CGU groups to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and the growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Thereafter, a perpetuity is applied to the final years cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rates applied, the growth rates and margins assumed over the forecast period.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
The Group bases its estimate for the pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The inputs to this calculation are derived from market and industry data.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs are in the range 10.6% to 12.3% 2013: 10.3% to 11.7%.
Growth rates The growth rates applied reflect managements judgement regarding the potential future performance of the business.
These incorporate the effects of the global recession over the last three years, the expected recovery of the CGUs affected and the past experience of the Group as it emerged from previous recessions.
The medium term comprises the years 2016 to 2019.
The average real growth rate used during this period is 3.0%, although particular years may be higher or lower than this rate reflecting market conditions.
The long term growth rate applied to the perpetuity calculations was between 2.0% and 2.5% per annum 2013: 2.0% and 2.5% reflecting the average long term EBIT growth rates of the economies in which the CGUs are based.
The assumptions used for the most significant groups of CGUs by amount of goodwill are as follows: Medium term real growth rate Post tax discount rate excluding inflation Long term growth rate BNE: E UK and Ireland 10.6% 3.0% 2.1% AAP 11.5% 3.0% 2.5% Energy global 11.9% 3.0% 2.2% Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charge resulting 2013: nil.
The BNE: Europe UK and Ireland CGU grouping has the lowest percentage headroom.
An increase in the discount rate of 3.0%, a 2015 budget miss of 30% or a reduction in the medium term growth rate of 10.0% would reduce the headroom to zero.
The AAP CGU grouping has the next lowest percentage headroom.
An increase in the discount rate of 3.4%, a 2015 budget miss of 26% or a reduction in the medium term growth rate of 12.0% would reduce the headroom to zero.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on these differences as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the fiscal authority.
Included within the closing balance of 795,000 for provisions and other timing differences are deferred tax assets of 647,000 relating to UK trading losses and 331,000 relating to the defined benefit pension scheme deficit.

The payment made will be in the range of nil to 1,500,000 and the fair value has been determined by estimating the likelihood of payment.
Goodwill arising represents the value of the workforce acquired, potential synergies, future contracts and access to new markets.
There is no tax deductible goodwill.

Acquisitions continued The vendors of the acquired companies have entered into warranty agreements with the Group.
The total undiscounted cash flow that could be receivable by the Group is between nil and 14,372,000.
The Group does not expect that these warranties will become receivable and therefore has not recognised an indemnification asset on acquisition.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 1,160,000 which have been expensed through the income statement and are included within amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related expenses.

A reconciliation of the goodwill movement in 2014 in respect of acquisitions made in 2013 and 2014 is given in the table below.
No negative goodwill was recognised in 2013 or 2014.
Defined benefit pension scheme The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes, arising from the acquisition in 2013 of the OEC Group.
These schemes are closed to new entrants.
The schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to post-retirement yearly instalments amounting to 66% of pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 67.
The pensionable salary is the difference between the current salary of the employee and the state retirement benefit.
The schemes expose the company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
66 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts The most recent full actuarial valuations of the plans assets and present value of the defined benefit liabilities were carried out in October 2014 and December 2014 for the two schemes by a qualified actuary.
The principal assumptions used for the purposes of actuarial valuation were as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate 3.00% 4.10% Expected rate of salary increase 3.25% 3.75% Inflation 3.00% 1.75% There are two defined benefit schemes in Norway: all principal assumptions are the same for both schemes other than the expected rate of pension increase.
One scheme has assumptions of 3.0% and the other used 0.10%.
Mortality assumptions The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: Years 2014 2013 Retiring today: Males 21.8 20.4 Females 25.0 23.2 This is based on Norways standard mortality table with modifications to reflect expected changes in mortality.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 000s 2014 2013 Current service cost 288 Net Interest Expense 27 Components of defined benefit costs recognised in profit or loss 315 The service charge for the year of 288,000 has been included in the income statement in administrative expenses.
The net interest expense has been included within finance costs see note 6 and the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability is included in the statement of comprehensive income.

Financial Risk Management a Capital management The capital of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings and facilities disclosed in note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and notes 21 and 22.
The Group manages its capital to support its strategy, and there were no changes in approach to capital management during the year.
The borrowings are managed centrally and funds are onward lent to operating subsidiaries as required.
There are two main borrowing facilities.
First, the Group has a committed 125 million multi currency revolving credit facility that provides a high degree of flexibility.
There are two financial covenants related to this facility: interest cover must be no less than 400% and the ratio of group net borrowings including deferred consideration to EBITDA should be no greater than 250%.
These covenants are tested regularly and were not breached during the year and have not been since the year end.
Secondly, the Group has a $150m, seven year US private placement shelf facility.
Seven year notes with principal of 30.0 million were drawn in September 2014 bearing fixed interest at 3.98% per annum.
Seven year notes with principal of $34.1 million were drawn at the same time bearing fixed interest at 3.84% per annum.
There are two financial covenants associated with this facility: interest cover must be no less than 400% and leverage must be no greater than 300%.
These loan notes represent the Groups core debt.
The Groups businesses provide a good level of cash generation which helps fund future growth.
The Group seeks to minimise borrowings by utilising cash generated by operations that is surplus to the immediate operating needs of the business and an objective is to maintain a minimum level of cash at bank.
b Financial instruments The Groups financial assets comprise cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise bank loans, deferred consideration and trade and other payables.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Fair values The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are considered to be materially equivalent to their book value.
The classification of financial instruments is shown in the table below.
As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2014 2013 Cash 17,521 18,699 Trade receivables 157,518 147,737 Financial assets 175,039 166,436 Borrowings 90,701 51,067 Deferred consideration 26,710 35,842 Trade and other payables 74,413 75,572 Financial liabilities 191,824 162,481 Interest rate and currency risk are the most significant aspects for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to liquidity risk that is reviewed in note 16.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
c Interest rate risk The Group draws down term loans, typically between one and three months, against its revolving credit facility in US Dollars, GB Pounds, Australian Dollars and Norwegian Krone at fixed rates of interest for the term of the loan.
The Group has not entered any contracts to fix interest rates beyond the period of the term loans but will consider doing so if borrowings becomes significantly larger and longer term.
The Groups overdraft bears interest at floating rates.

Cash balances at year end: As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2014 2013 Sterling 1,654 1,571 Euro 733 1,146 US Dollar 4,015 4,487 Australian Dollar 2,245 1,322 Canadian Dollar 4,935 5,369 Norwegian Krone 2,608 3,400 Malaysian Ringgit 836 924 Other 495 480 17,521 18,699 70 Report and Accounts 2014 Accounts Cash balances are held in either non-interest bearing current accounts or instant access deposit accounts earning floating rate interest.
There are no interest bearing trade and other receivables.
Borrowing facilities The Group has an undrawn revolving credit facility that expires in 2016.
During 2014, the Group also had an uncommitted overdraft facility, carrying floating rate interest.
Interest rate sensitivity The Group is mainly exposed to interest rate sensitivity in respect of its revolving credit facility.
A 1.0% decrease in interest rates would increase Group profit before tax by 694,000.
A 1.0% increase in interest rates would decrease Group profit before tax by 694,000. d Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investments in overseas operations in the Netherlands, Ireland, USA, Canada, Australia and Norway that have functional currencies other than sterling.
As a result the Groups balance sheet and income statement can be affected by movement in the exchange rate between sterling and the functional currencies of overseas operations.
The most important exchange rates as far as the Group is concerned is the GB Pound to Australian Dollar rate and GB pound to US Dollar.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts held at year end was not material.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposures.
A number of the Groups operations transact in currencies other than their functional currency.
This creates a foreign currency exposure that is monitored and hedged centrally using a risk based approach.
Foreign currency sensitivity Since the Group hedges the majority of its transactional foreign currency exposures, the sensitivity of the results to transactional foreign currency risk is not material.
e Credit Risk It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
The Group does not enter into complex derivatives to manage credit risk.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider the Groups financial assets that are not impaired to be of good credit quality including those that are past due.
See note 14 for further detail on receivables that are past due.
The groups financial assets are not secured by collateral advanced by counterparties.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group has a broad range of clients, the largest being multi-national oil companies, national oil companies or substantial utility companies.
Infrequently and generally for administrative reasons there may be a build up of unpaid invoices.
At December 2014 there was a material amount owing from a national oil company that was substantially paid in January 2015.
The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
