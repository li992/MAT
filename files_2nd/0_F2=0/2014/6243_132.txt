However, the SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable.
During the fiscal year ended 31 December 2014, the Group credited US$9.1 million of mining concession rights against the SMR.
Total mining concessions right paid during the year were US$16 million and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses.
Mining concessions rights paid in excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess.

On the basis of managements internal forecast, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$169.1 million 2013: US$159.2 million.
The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$4.5 million 2013: US$5.6 million on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits.
d Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,528 million 2013: US$1,271 million.
