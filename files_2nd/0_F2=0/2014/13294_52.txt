Employee benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
As noted in the accounting policies, actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes are not obtained for the most part because of the limited number of foreign employees.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the dened benefit type.
This scheme, along with the Ireland and USA dened benefit schemes, has ceased any future accrual for current members and these schemes are closed to new members.
UK, Ireland andUSA employees are now covered by dened contribution schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK dened benefit scheme was carried out at September 2012 and updated to 30th June 2014 by aqualied independent actuary.
The mortality assumption used for 2014 is S1PMA and S1PFA tables, CMI core 2011 model with long-term improvements of 1% per annum.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the UK and Ireland schemes were: UI VOF 30th June 2013 30th June 2012 6, TDIFNF SFMBOE TDIFNF UK scheme Ireland scheme UK scheme Ireland scheme Rate of increase in pension payments 3.5% 2.5% 2.7% 1.7% Discount rate 4.8% 3.6% 4.3% 3.4% Ination rate RPI 3.7% 2.5% 2.7% 1.7% Ination rate CPI o 2.7% 1.7% Retirement age 64 65 64 65 The assets and liabilities in the dened benefit schemes were: UI VOF % of 30th June % of 30th June % of 30th June % of 30th June % of total 2013 total 2012 total 2011 total 2010 total b assets 000 assets 000 assets 000 assets 000 assets Market value of assets: Equities 98 117,114 99 93,827 99 99,365 98 81,737 98 Bonds and cash 2 1,653 1 1,409 1 1,684 2 1,447 2 100 118,767 100 95,236 100 101,049 100 83,184 100 Actuarial value of liabilities 160,485 137,224 138,713 120,435 deficit in the schemes 41,718 41,988 37,664 37,251 Deferred tax thereon 8,973 9,519 9,393 9,694 Note C. 36 gives the analysis of the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
