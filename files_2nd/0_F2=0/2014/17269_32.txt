Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2014 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
Accounting developments and changes IAS 19 as revised in June 2011 Employee Benets has been adopted by the Group in the current financial year and has been applied retrospectively.
The interest cost and expected return on dened benefit pension scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a net interest amount, which is calculated by applying a single discount rate to the net dened benefit liability or asset.
Furthermore, IAS 19 Revised also introduces more extensive disclosures in the presentation of the dened benefit cost, including the clarification on treatment of the schemes administrative expenses.
To aid comparison, the consolidated financial statements and affected notes for the year ended 31 July 2013 have been restated, with the following effects on the previous years consolidated financial statement: 2013 Other costs m Net pension finance cost 13 profit before tax reduced by 13 Taxation 4 profit after tax reduced by 9 Other comprehensive income 9 The effect on basic and diluted earnings per share on continuing and discontinued operations was a reduction of 3.3 pence and 3.2pence respectively.
In addition to IAS 19 Revised, the following new standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group in the current financial year: t IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements t IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities t IFRS 13 Fair value measurement t IFRS 7 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities t Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Amendments to IAS 36 The effect of the above standards has been assessed by the Group and is not material.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out in note 37 on pages 143 to 156.
The following standard has been published, but not yet applied in the current financial year: t IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
No other issued standard or interpretation would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Choices permitted by IFRS The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Many of the Groups accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates.
Wolseley plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Impairment of assets The Group reviews assets that have an indefinite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying value.
The recoverable amount is dened as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, which in turn is the present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use of the cash generating unit or where appropriate aggregation of cash generating units CGU to which they are attributed.
The estimate of value in use, and hence the outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about revenue growth, long-term growth rate of their market and the discount rate considered appropriate to reect the time value of money and any risks specic to the CGU that are not reected in the cash ows.
Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all these assumptions and, further details concerning the sensitivity of key judgements made by the Directors have been presented on pages 121 and 122.
There has been no impairment charge in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets at 31 July 2014 2013: 10 million.
Rebates receivable from vendors The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide rebates from the cost of inventory purchased.
Many of these agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year rather than a financial year, and under certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made.
The Group adjusts the cost of inventory purchased to reect estimated rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying period.
Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost of inventory is based.
Valuation of inventories Inventory comprises nished goods.
Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost.
Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identied.
The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical experience.
The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based.
The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2014 amounting to 113 million 2013: 127 million.
Provisions Provisions for self-insured risks, legal claims, environmental restoration and onerous leases are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Such provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for self-insured risks The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are managed by a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited.
Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual actuarial assessment.
The provision for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported.
The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision isbased.
At 31 July 2014, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 41 million 2013: 51 million.
Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos related litigation and product liability claims, where an outow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter.
In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers.
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2014, legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to 151 million 2013: 147 million.
Where the Group has insurance cover that it is virtually certain will settle a provision then it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables.
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes.
In these cases, where material, appropriate disclosure would be included in the financial statements but no provision would be made and no contingent liability can be quantied.
Wolseley plc 111 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Provisions continued Provisions for onerous leases When the present value of the future cash ows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall rstly against the carrying amount of the assets in the case of finance leases and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract for all leases.
Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future net cash ows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
Actual cash ows paid and received may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2014, the provision for onerous leases was 42 million 2013: 39 million.
Taxation Accruals for current tax are based on managements interpretation of country-specic tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained.
Where management considers it probable that the tax position will be sustained, each material tax benefit is reviewed to assess whether it should be recognised in full, or whether provision should be made for a potential settlement through negotiation.
All such provisions are included in current liabilities.
Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benets The Group operates dened benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 25.
The dened pension benefit obligation is calculated annually for each scheme by using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations.
The Groups liability or surplus recognised on the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating to the terms of the pension obligations.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and ination.
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
The net interest amount is calculated by applying the discounted rate used to measure the dened benefit obligation at the beginning of the period tothe dened benefit net asset liability.
The pension scheme net interest is presented as finance income or expense.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate, ination and life expectancy.
The table below shows the impact of the sensitivities on the net asset liability.

These risks are actively managed by the Joint Working Group which comprises the Trustees of the Wolseley Group Retirement benefit Plan and company employees.
More detail can be found in note 25.

Segmental analysis The Groups reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products and building materials.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal.
The Groups customer base is highly diversied, with no individually significant customer.
At 31 July 2014, management reviewed the Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 and concluded to report Central Europe and France as one reporting segment, Central Europe and France, given that they represent less than 10 per cent of the Groups operating profit and does not meet other quantitative thresholds.
All comparatives were restated for the purposes of consistency and comparability.
Revenue by reportable segment is as follows: 2014 2013 m m USA 7,070 6,785 Canada 779 875 UK 1,853 1,769 Nordic 1,935 1,916 Central Europe and France 1,493 1,809 Group 13,130 13,154 Trading profit loss note 9 and operating profit loss by reportable segment for the year ended 31 July 2014 are as follows: Amortisation and impairment Trading Exceptional of acquired Operating profit loss items intangibles profit loss m m m m USA 546 14 532 Canada 44 44 UK 96 17 1 112 Nordic 73 28 31 14 Central Europe and France 31 26 57 Central and other costs 35 3 32 Group 755 18 46 727 Finance income 2 Finance costs 31 profit before tax 698 Trading profit loss note 9 and operating profit loss by reportable segment for the year ended 31 July 2013 have been restated as follows: Amortisation and impairment Trading Exceptional of acquired Operating profit loss items intangibles profit loss m m m m USA 492 18 474 Canada 51 51 UK 95 6 1 88 Nordic 86 27 35 24 Central Europe and France 43 127 11 95 Central and other costs 42 4 46 Group 725 164 65 496 Finance income 3 Finance costs 39 profit before tax 460 Wolseley plc 113 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, then any reversal of those provisions is shown as exceptional.
Exceptional items included in operating profit from continuing operations are analysed by purpose as follows: 2014 2013 m m significant restructuring programmes including staff redundancy costs 142 Acquisition and integration costs 18 Gain on disposal of businesses 32 21 Loss on closure of businesses and revaluations of held for sale disposal groups 11 32 Other exceptional items 15 11 Total included in operating profit 18 164 Acquisition and integration costs relate to the acquisition in Finland and include transaction costs, onerous leases and redundancy costs linked to the closure of a number of branches as part of the integration plan.
Gains on disposal are principally write-backs on consideration received in the financial year in the form of loan notes which relate to disposals in previous years.
In addition, we recognised small gains for the businesses sold in Central Europe and France mainly due to the recycling of a cumulative foreign exchange gain.
Loss on closure of businesses includes the impairment of assets on closure of branches in the Nordic region.
8 million of the loss is shown as an exceptional item in cost of sales.
Other exceptional items include 11 million of gains on property disposals in France of which 4 million were reported as part of trading profit in the first half of the year.
The 2013 exceptional restructuring and redundancy charge of 142 million arose from reorganisation of our businesses in Central Europe and France and the Nordic region.
38 million of this related to redundancies and the remainder arose from asset write-downs, onerous leases, other provisions and other costs.
Exceptional items relating to discontinued operations are detailed in note 7.

The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore, in accordance with accounting standards, it has been excluded from these financial statements.
Non-GAAP performance measures Trading profit is dened as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
As explained on page 154, the Group considers that trading profit, and other performance measures based on it, including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the financial statements.

The relevant inputs to the value-in-use calculations of each CGU were: t Cash ow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved strategic plan: the forecast for year five represents an estimate of mid-cycle trading performance for the CGU based on historic analysis.
Year four is calculated as the average ofthe final year of the strategic plan and year ves mid-cycle estimate.
t A risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country which ranges from 9.1 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
t The 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in July 2014 has been used for all CGUs except for the Nordic region where a lower long-term growth rate was applied consistent with the previous year.
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level.
Consideration is given to past events, knowledge of future contracts and the wider economy.
It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.
Management performed a sensitivity analysis for each key assumption revenue growth, discount rate and long-term growth rate, keeping all other assumptions constant.
There are three CGUs all within the Nordic region with limited headroom at 31 July 2014: Stark, Neumann and Silvan.
In addition, Starkki showed limited headroom at 31 January 2014 which increased in the second half following an acquisition in March 2014 see note 30.
We have disclosed the sensitivity analysis for the CGUs with limited headroom at the end of the financial year.
The results presented in the table below show the amounts by which the related assumptions can vary such that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equals their recoverable amounts.

UK deferred tax is therefore recognised at the reduced rate of 20 per cent.
Deferred tax assets in the UK have been recognised on the basis that the UK is forecast to have sufficient taxable profits in the future toenable these to be utilised.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 46 million 2013: 115 million that have not been recognised onthe basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The losses are in the UK and France.
The UK losses relate to capital transactions and are not recognised on the basis that there are no transactions resulting in capital gains against which they can be offset.
The French losses relate to asset impairments that have not been recognised on the basis that France is not forecasting to have sufficient taxable profits in the future toutilise them.
None of these losses has an expiry date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on 207 million 2013: 386 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and itis probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Financial instruments and financial risk management There have been no significant changes during the year to the Groups policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of financial instruments.
These policies are summarised on pages 148 to 154.
Capital structure To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio does not exceed 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity During the year ended 31 July 2014, the Group entered into a 300 million revolving facility which matures in August 2015.
In addition the Group added a further 59 million $100 million to the existing 296 million $500 million securitisation of US trade receivables facility maturing in October 2016.
As at 31 July 2014, 250 million was drawn under the 300 million facility mentioned above.

The environmental and legal provision includes 49 million 31 July 2013: 51 million for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 2.6 per cent 2013: 3.3 per cent.
This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2014 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover signicantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash ow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash ows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.
Other provisions include warranty and separation costs relating to businesses disposed of and rental commitments on vacant properties and dilapidations on leased properties.

Retirement benefit obligations continued iv Plan risks As described on page 155, the dened benefit plans typically expose the Company to the following actuarial risks which are managed by a Joint Working Group, comprising the Trustees of the dened benefit plan and employees of the Company.
Investment risk The present value of the dened benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease a net surplus or increase a net pension liability.
Currently the plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equity securities and property to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability, and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the dened benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.

From 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014, shares were issued to satisfy options exercised under the Groups share schemes.
Following approval at the Annual General Meeting held on 26 November 2013 and in connection with the special dividend approved at that meeting, a share 53 5 consolidation under which shareholders received 30 new ordinary shares of 10 pence for every 31 existing ordinary shares of 10 pence 66 11 each, became effective on 2 December 2013.
The share consolidation resulted in the number of ordinary shares in issue decreasing by 8,856,602 shares.
During the year, the Company issued 1,027,171 2013: 533,648 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.1 million 2013: 0.1 million to participants in the long-term incentive schemes and all-employee sharesave plans for an aggregate consideration of 14 million 2013: 8 million.
The terms of issue were xed on the respective dates of grant.
The relevant dates of grants were between November 2003 and April 2013 and the market price on those dates were between 5.30 and 32.38.
This consideration was settled in cash.
A summary of the movements in the year is detailed in the following table: 2014 2013 5 Number of 10 pence ordinary shares in the Company in issue at 1 August 274,361,228 286,281,635 11 Effect of share consolidation 8,856,602 12,454,055 Exercise of executive share options 322,489 150,141 Exercise of savings related share options 704,682 383,507 53 5 Number of 10 pence 2013: 10 pence ordinary shares in the Company in issue at 31 July 266,531,797 274,361,228 66 11 Wolseley plc 135 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.

There were no other significant changes to the Groups share plans.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent.
The number of outstanding and number of exercisable share options and share awards are detailed below.

The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes except the Long Term Incentive Scheme, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used.
The fair value of shares granted under the Ordinary Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan for more information please refer to page 155 was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Long Term Executive Share Options Employee Share Options Incentive Schemes 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 Risk free interest rate 1.8% 1.1% 1.6% 0.4% 0.4% 0.7% Expected dividend yield 2.5% 2.9% 2.9% 2.4% 0.0% 3.0% Expected volatility 43% 42% 29% 35% 29% 33% Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1-6 years 1-7 years 3 years 3 years Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due to the Groups capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.
The principal assumptions for the Ordinary Share Plan are an expected dividend yield of approximately 2.5 per cent and an expected life of three years.

Acquisitions continued The acquisitions contributed 144 million to revenue, 5 million to trading profit and 2 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 13,430 million and Group trading profit would have been 769 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, as stated above.
It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Some of these operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for.
At 31 July 2014, provisions include an amount of 42 million 2013: 39 million in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of sublease payments expected to be received.
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2014 is 14 million 2013: 17 million.
Contingent liabilities Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees.
Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise.
In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.
Certain claims arise as a result of the unintentional supply of defective products and these claims are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group.
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals Following a review of the appropriate allocation of the Groups resources in 2009, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers and other third parties, including warranties regarding financial statements and taxation.
Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provisions has been made could be received in the future.
Group companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be called in an event of default.
As at the dateofthis report there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Environmental The operations of certain Group companies, particularly those engaged in processing, converting or treating building materials, are subject tospecic environmental regulations.
From time to time the Group conducts preliminary investigations through third parties to assess potential risks including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites.
Where an obligation to remediate contamination arises then this is provided for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made.
Outcome The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Post balance sheet events A one year extension of the securitisation of the US trade receivables facility was approved on 23 September 2014.

Additional information Group accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out below.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the trading and financial results of the Group.
In addition, management presents trading profit, headline profit and headline earnings per share to provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
Examples of such items that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to: t Restructuring and other expenses relating to the integration of an acquired business t Gains losses on disposal of businesses t Acquisition related costs principally relating to professional fees t Costs arising as a result of material and non-recurring regulatory and litigation matters Consolidation The consolidated financial information includes the results of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2014.
The trading results of businesses operations are included in profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated onconsolidation, with the exception of gains losses required under relevant IFRS accounting standards.
Discontinued operations When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations it classies such operations as discontinued.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations isshown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of the Group.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end.
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve see the separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments.
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency net borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Business combinations The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
Acquisition related costs are expensed.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Groups ordinary activities, excluding intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer.
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or picked up by the customer.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed.
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised in the period that loyalty credits are redeemed.
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are xed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and overheads attributable to assembly and construction services.
Vendor rebates The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates.
These purchase rebates are accrued asearned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included within intangible assets.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or aggregations of cash generating units together CGUs where synergy benets are expected.
CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
No CGU is larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses onthe disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to each CGU.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Other intangible assets An intangible asset, which is an identiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benets attributable to the asset will ow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably.
The asset is deemed to be identiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Other intangible assets continued Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other intangible assets.
The cost of the intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 4 25 years Trade names and brands 1 15 years Other 1 4 years Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income statement over its estimated useful life as follows: Software 3 5 years Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated.
Property, plant and equipment PPE PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
In addition, subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 20 50 years Operating leasehold improvements over the period of the lease Plant and machinery 7 10 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Fixtures and ttings 5 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.
The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts.
The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as operating leases.
The cost of operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Assets and disposal groups held for sale Assets are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business.
Where agroup of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also classied as held for sale.
For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected toresult in a completed sale within 12 months.
Assets that are classied as held for sale are not depreciated.
Assets or disposal groups that are classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise all goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions in those items of inventory.
The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Examples of such evidence include significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off arecredited to the income statement.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2014 in respect of impaired receivables represented 0.15per cent of revenue 2013: 0.19 per cent.
The Group held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2014 amounting to 39 million 2013: 46 million.
Retirement benefit obligations Contributions to dened contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benets are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For dened benefit pension plans and other retirement benets, the cost of providing benets is determined annually using the projected unit credit method by independent qualied actuaries.
The current service cost of dened benefit plans is recorded within operating profit.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The asset liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of dened benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised tothe extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups executive share option, long-term incentive, employee share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a requirement for employees to save and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders of the Company or paid.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Cash, which is not freely available to the Group, is disclosed as restricted cash.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from thebusiness activities of the Group and the nancing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash ows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not full the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classied as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in theincome statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Additional information continued Additional information about financial instruments continued The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on observable yield curves.
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Other receivables include an amount of 48 million 2013: 50 million which has been discounted at a rate of 2.6 per cent 2013: 3.3 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.
Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear oating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values.
The book values and fair values of categories including non-current assets and liabilities can be compared as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Trade and other receivables, excluding prepayments and accrued income 1,919 1,919 1,980 1,980 Trade and other payables, excluding accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security 1,999 1,999 2,135 2,135 Bank loans and overdrafts 520 520 264 264 Senior unsecured notes 430 447 491 510 Finance lease obligations 43 43 57 57 Financial instruments: disclosure of offsetting arrangements The financial instruments that have been offset in the financial statements are disclosed below: Gross Offset Financial balances amounts statements a b c At 31 July 2014 Notes m m m Financial assets Non-current assets Derivative financial assets 17 61 30 31 Current assets Derivative financial assets 17 20 9 11 Cash and cash equivalents 18 1,395 1,155 240 1,476 1,194 282 Financial liabilities Current liabilities Derivative financial liabilities 17 30 30 Bank loans and overdrafts 21 1,314 1,155 159 Finance leases 23 7 7 Non-current liabilities Derivative financial liabilities 17 9 9 Bank loans 21 791 791 Finance leases 23 36 36 2,187 1,194 993 Closing net debt 32 711 711 Wolseley plc 150 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information 37.

Financial instruments: risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well dened policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2014 and 31 July 2013.
By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change during or since the previous year-end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period underreview, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash ows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Wolseley plc 151 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Additional information continued Additional information about financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outows excluding interest income and income from derivatives including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that oating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash ows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash ows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Trade and other Interest payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July 2014 m m m m Due in less than one year 1,888 156 28 2,072 Due in one to two years 20 390 21 431 Due in two to three years 9 6 17 32 Due in three to four years 79815 120 Due in four to five years 6 3 12 21 Due in over five years 69 303 28 400 Total 1,999 956 121 3,076 Trade and other Interest payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July 2013 m m m m Due in less than one year 2,032 37 31 2,100 Due in one to two years 14 87 31 132 Due in two to three years 12 151 24 187 Due in three to four years 6 1 19 26 Due in four to five years 5 103 15 123 Due in over five years 66 322 43 431 Total 2,135 701 163 2,999 Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 54 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 13 per cent in euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash ow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or currency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the five year summary on page 167.
The net effect of currency translation was to decrease revenue by 462 million 3.5 per cent 2013: increase by 59 million, or 0.4 per cent and to decrease trading profit by 31 million 4.2 per cent 2013: increase by 5 million or 0.6 per cent.
These currency effects reect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, euros and Canadian dollars as follows: Wolseley plc 152 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information 37.

The principal value of those financial instruments designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was 1,260 million 2013: 1,539 million.
The gain on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of 77 million 2013: loss of 43 million has been taken to the translation reserve.
At 31 July 2014, the Group had the following short-term currency swaps and forward contracts which were designated and effective as hedges of overseas operations.
Forward Currency Contracts 2014 Swaps 2014 Currency Currency million m million m Bought sold forward SEK 35 3 DKK 1,200 128 DKK 28 3 GBP 128 128 Currency Swaps 2013 Currency million m Bought sold forward DKK 1,440 169 GBP 166 166 3 Interest rate risk To manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations, the Groups policy is between 0 per cent and 50 per cent of projected borrowings required during the next two years should be at xed rates.
However, this percentage is regularly reviewed by the Board and 63per cent of loans were at xed rates at 31 July 2014.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
Rates which reset at least every 12 months are regarded as oating rates, and the Group then if appropriate considers interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate prole.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from oating rate arrangements.
During November 2011, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising xed interest payable on US$664 million of notional principal.
The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the xed interest rates range between 1.51 per cent and 2.94 per cent.
These contracts have been held since inception at fair value through profit or loss.
With effect from 1 December 2011 interest rate swap contracts comprising xed interest receivable on an original notional principal of US$729 million US$664 million at 31 July 2014 have been classied as held at fair value through profit or loss.
The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the xed interest rates range between 5.05 per cent and 5.32 per cent 2013: 5.05 per cent and 5.32 per cent.

Credit risk Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able topay outstanding balances.
At 31 July 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk was 1,919 million 2013: 1,980 million.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In some cases protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases eldbased.
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash ows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of 282 million 2013: 401 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group has estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to the income statement of 3 million, arising from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would result in a charge to equity of 74 million 2013: 57 million, arising from the translation of borrowings denominated in foreign currency, and a credit of 4 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation of interest rate swaps held at fair value through profit or loss 2013: 7 million.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macroeconomic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.
Additonal information about non-GAAP measures and performance Trading profit is dened as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.

The Group also operates two dened benefit plans in the United States which are closed to new entrants.
One of the plans is funded and the majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.

Most of the Canadian dened benefit plans are funded.
In Europe, both dened contribution and dened benefit plans are operated.
Liabilities arising under dened benefit plans are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Investment policy The Groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specic allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK plan, the policy is to invest approximately 70 per cent of the assets in equities and 30 per cent in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Company.
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in dened levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.
