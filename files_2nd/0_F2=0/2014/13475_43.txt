Mineral resources As required by the Australian Securities Exchange, the following tables contain details of other mineralisation that has a reasonable prospect of being economically extracted in the future but which is not yet classified as Proved or Probable Ore Reserves.
This material is defined as Mineral Resources under the JORC Code.
Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors.
While in the judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.
As in the case of Ore Reserves, managed operations estimates are completed using or testing against Rio Tinto, long-term pricing and market forecasts scenarios.
Mineral Resources are stated as additional to the Ore Reserves reported earlier.
Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the Mineral Resources are published as received from the managing company.
Where new project Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves are footnoted as being reported for the first time, additional information about them can be viewed on the Rio Tinto website.
