Segment information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal management reporting.
For the purposes of managing the business, the Group is organised into two reportable segments: Engineered Conveyor Solutions and Advanced Engineered Products.
Engineered Conveyor Manufacture of rubber ply, solid woven and steel cord conveyor belting for mining, power generation and Solutions industrial applications with complementary service operations which design, install, monitor, maintain and operate conveyor systems for mining and industrial customers.
Advanced Engineered Manufacture of precision polymer products including: Products - precision drives for computer peripherals, copiers and ATMs: - problem-solving power transmission and motion transfer components: - silicone and complex hoses for heavy duty trucks, buses and off-road vehicles: - lay-flat hoses for firefighting, agriculture, water and gas industries: - seals and sealing solutions for the fluid power and oil & gas industries: - technical textiles for medical and industrial applications and silicone-based products for medical applications: - rollers for digital image processing and medical diagnostics: and - fluropolymer components for fluid, oil and gas handling and medical applications.
Operating segments within these reportable segments have been aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics with similar products and services, production processes, methods of distribution and customer types.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purpose of IFRS 8 is the Board of Directors.
The financial position of the segments is reported to the CODM on a monthly basis and this information is used to assess the performance of the Group and to allocate resources on an appropriate basis.
Segment performance is reviewed down to the operating profit level.
Financing costs and taxation are managed on a Group basis so these costs are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices on inter-segment revenues are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
