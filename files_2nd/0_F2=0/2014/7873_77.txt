111 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING COSTS What you will find in this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The directors determine the appropriate capital structure for the Group, specifically, how much cash is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.
The Board is mindful that equity capital cannot be easily flexed and in particular raising new equity would normally be likely only in the context of an acquisition.
Debt can be issued and repurchased more easily but frequent adjustments lead to high transaction costs and debt holders are under no obligation to accept repurchase offers.
4.1 Net debt Net cash debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total outstanding debt, net of the current cash resources.
Some of the Groups borrowings and cash is held in foreign currencies.
Movements in foreign exchange rates affect the sterling value of the net debt.
