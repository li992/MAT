The tax effect is shown separately within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 88.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, a number of changes to the UK corporation tax system have been proposed or enacted.
A further reduction in the main rate has been enacted, reducing the main rate to 20% from 1 April 2015.
This reduction has been reflected in the deferred tax items in the balance sheet which are predominantly measured at this 20% rate.
This change is not therefore expected to further impact future tax charges.
