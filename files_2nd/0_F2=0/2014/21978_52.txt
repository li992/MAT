Retirement benefit plans continued If the deficit at 2014 is below the value of the remaining 2011 recovery plan, no additional deficit contributions are necessary and the remaining recovery plan will be revised.
Likewise, if the deficit at 2017 is below the remaining recovery plan at that time.
Other protection of BTPS member benets In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and which applies upon the winding up of BT.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that the Crown Guarantee can cover members who joined before and after privatisation.
The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
In a further High Court decision issued in December 2011, it was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT nor does it cover benefit augmentations granted by BT.
The judgments were appealed on 30 April 2014 and a decision from the Court of Appeal is pending.
the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Other benefit plans In addition to the BTPS, the group maintains benefit plans in most other countries with a focus on these being appropriate for the local market and culture.
After the BTPS, the largest dened benefit plan sponsored by the group is a plan in the Netherlands with liabilities of around 120m.
As part of the group-wide restructuring programme, a dened benefit plan in the US, with liabilities of 60m, was closed and is being wound up, resulting in a settlement charge of around 2m.
This charge is included as a specic item within restructuring costs see note 8.
The BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS is the largest dened contribution scheme maintained by the group with around 26,000 active members.
In the year to 31 March 2014, the group contributed 97m to the BTRSS.
