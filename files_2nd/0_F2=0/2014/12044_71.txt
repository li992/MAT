The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period of the purchase contract.
22 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese joint ventures.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 91 22 Financial risk management continued The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2014 2013 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate Euro 1.24 1.28 1.17 1.20 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Investments 3.8 3.6 Sensitivity analysis A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.3m loss gain in relation to investments 2013: 0.3m.
Interest rate risk The Group currently holds no fixed interest borrowings.
This reflects both the low borrowing requirements of the Group and the current low interest rates applicable to floating borrowings.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Sensitivity analysis If in the year ended 31 December 2014 UK interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.4m 2013: increased decreased by 0.3m.
The Groups post-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.3m 2013: increased decreased by 0.2m.
These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the net financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on the wider economic environment such as house pricing, mortgage availability and exchange rates.
Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the risk of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities and work in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2014, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 10.1m 2013: 10.7m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy in relation to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under the syndicated loan even in the event of deterioration in market conditions.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
The liabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 92 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial risk management continued Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained: and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size of the Group.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable on request from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by four leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group maintains a 300m revolving credit facility committed to March 2019.
These committed facilities are sufficient to meet projected liquidity requirements to this date.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 300m 2013: 300m.
Cash deposits The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of net cash debt borrowings as detailed in note 20 offset by cash and bank balances and equity of the Group comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst also maintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and a system of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.
The Group is currently pursuing a strategy of capital return to shareholders, whilst at the same time building a stronger, larger business.
Full details are available in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 33.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments not discounted.

Whilst generally repayable upon demand, in practice it is unlikely there will be any required repayment in the short term.

In all but a small minority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
The pressures of recent market conditions necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure from 2008 onwards.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk of the Group in respect of such sales.
There was 0.8m requirement for a charge in relation to credit impairment in the year 2013: 0.6m.
The maximum total credit risk is as follows: 2014 2013 Group m m Trade and other receivables 67.3 82.4 Available for sale financial assets 201.3 215.4 Cash and cash equivalents 378.4 204.3 647.0 502.1 Company Loans and receivables including intercompany balances 866.2 845.6 Cash and cash equivalents 301.0 129.8 1,167.2 975.4 The maximum credit exposure of the Group to overseas parties is under 0.1m 2013: under 0.1m Company: nil 2013: nil.
The Groups credit risk is widely distributed.
The maximum credit risk should any single party excepting financial institutions fail to perform is 2.7m 2013: 0.8m and is not yet due Company: 348.7m 2013: 323.6m being a subsidiary debtor.
The Directors consider these financial assets to be of high quality and the credit risk is assessed as low.
The maximum credit risk associated with a financial institution in respect of short term cash deposits is 91.0m 2013: 50.0m.
