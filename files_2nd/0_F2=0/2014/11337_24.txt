Notes to the accounts 1 General information Northgate plc is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 112.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 4 and in the strategic report on pages 9 to 32.
The accounts are presented in UK Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2 Principal accounting policies Statement of compliance The accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The accounts have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group accounts comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Going concern The accounts continue to be prepared on a going concern basis since the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future as set out on page 27 of the Financial Review.
Changes in accounting policy IAS 19, Employee benefits was amended in June 2011.
The impact on the Group was to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability.
The impact of this in the income statement is less than 0.1 million.
Prior year numbers have not been restated as the amounts are not considered material.
IFRS 13, 'Fair value measurement' has not been applied as the impact is not considered to be material.
Various other new accounting standards and amendments were issued during the year, none of which have had or are expected to have any significant impact on the Group and effects will principally relate to amendment and extension of current disclosures.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2013 and 30 April 2014.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary undertaking are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of subsidiary undertakings to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

indb 68 15 07 2014 12:59 2 Principal accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Group revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the hire of vehicles, sale of used vehicles and the supply of related goods and services in the normal course of business, net of value added tax and discounts.
Revenue from vehicle hire is recognised evenly over the hire period and revenue from sales of other related goods and services is recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue from the sale of used vehicles is recognised at the point of sale.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses identified through annual or other tests for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 13 years Intangible assets other Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed three years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Certain properties were revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS.
These valuations were treated as deemed cost at the time of adopting IFRS for the first time.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 50 years or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter Plant, equipment & fittings 3 to 10 years Vehicles for hire 3 to 6 years Motor vehicles 3 to 6 years Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
These depreciation rates have been determined with the anticipation that the net book values at the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the open market values for those vehicles.
Depreciation charges reflect adjustments made as a result of differences between expected and actual residual values of used vehicles, taking into account the further directly attributable costs to sell the vehicles.
Property under construction is not depreciated.
Depreciation commences when these assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.

indb 69 15 07 2014 12:59 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised in an earlier period, the Group reassesses whether there are any indications that such impairment has decreased or no longer exists.
If an impairment no longer exists, an impairment reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent required.
Inventories Used vehicles held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Other inventories comprise spare parts and consumables and are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
70 Northgate plc Annual report and accounts 2014 c109372.
indb 70 15 07 2014 12:59 2 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, where recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the items being hedged.
The fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the derivative counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement as a net profit or loss for the period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on the net investment hedges are transferred to the translation reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts.
Bank loans, other loans, loan notes and issue costs Bank loans, other loans and loan notes are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.

indb 71 15 07 2014 12:59 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Principal accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies other than UK Sterling are recorded at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
The net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into UK Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is recognised directly in equity.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated into UK Sterling using average exchange rates for the financial period and variances compared with the exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are recognised directly in equity, together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity.
They are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, with any variances reflected directly in equity.
All foreign exchange differences reflected directly in equity are shown in the translation reserve component of equity.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments As Lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives using Group policies.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
As Lessor: Motor vehicles and equipment hired to customers under operating leases are included within property, plant and equipment.
Income from such leases is taken to the income statement evenly over the period of the operating lease agreement.
Retirement benefit costs The Group predominantly operates defined contribution pension schemes but has one defined benefit scheme.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Pension contributions in respect of one of these arrangements are held in trustee administered funds, independently of the Groups finances.
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with updates to actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
72 Northgate plc Annual report and accounts 2014 c109372.
indb 72 15 07 2014 12:59 2 Principal accounting policies continued The Group also operates group personal pension plans.
The costs of these plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Employee share schemes and share based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and deferred annual bonuses, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and deferred annual bonuses are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity-settled payments granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market based performance criteria not being met.
The Group also operates a share incentive plan under which employees each have the option to purchase an amount of shares annually and receive an equivalent number of free shares.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense evenly throughout the period over which the employees must remain in the employ of the Group in order to receive the free shares.
Interest income and finance costs Interest income and finance costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Directors to be material and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the accounts are to be properly understood.
Dividends Dividends on Ordinary shares are recognised in the period in which they are either paid or formally approved, whichever is earlier.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Own shares The Group makes open market purchases of its own shares in order to satisfy the requirements of the Groups existing share schemes.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a reduction in shareholder equity.
The carrying values of own shares are compared to their market values at each reporting date and adjustments are made to write down the carrying value of own shares when, in the opinion of the Directors, there is a significant market value reduction.

indb 73 15 07 2014 12:59 Notes to the accounts continued 3 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors have made the following judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts.
Depreciation Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Group is required to review its depreciation rates and estimated useful lives regularly to ensure that the net book value of disposals of tangible fixed assets are broadly equivalent to their market value.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
In determining whether provision is required against any trade receivable, judgment is required in estimating the likely levels of recovery.
In exercising this judgment, consideration is given to both the overall economic environment in which a debtor operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of the nominal balance may be in doubt, for example days sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other qualitative information in respect of a customer.
Taxation The Group carries out tax planning consistent with a Group of its size and makes appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with the tax authorities.
To the extent that tax estimates result in the recognition of deferred tax assets, those assets are only carried in the balance sheet to the extent that it is considered that they are likely to be recovered in the short term.

Revenue from sale of vehicles is included as revenue in accordance with IAS 16 which requires used vehicle assets to be classified as inventories.
Used vehicle sales are included within UK and Spain operating segments, which reflects the level at which the executive Board of Directors allocate resources and review performance of the Group.
There is no significant intersegment trading.
Geographical information Revenues are attributed to countries on the basis of the companys location.
The Directors consider the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to be a single geographical segment on the grounds that the results and net assets of operations in the Republic of Ireland are immaterial to the Group as a whole.
Segment assets and liabilities exclude derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, since these balances are not included in the segments assets and liabilities as reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.

There has been no recognition of deferred tax assets previously derecognised.
On 1 April 2014 the UK Corporation tax rate changed from 23% to 21%.
A further change to the UK Corporation tax rate was announced in the March 2013 budget and subsequently enacted, to reduce the rate to 20% from 1 April 2015.
Based on the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, the tax disclosures reflect deferred tax measured at 21%.

13 Goodwill 2014 2013 Group 000 000 Carrying value: At 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2014 3,589 3,589 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has two cash generating units: the UK and Spain.
The goodwill balance all relates to the UK CGU.
The Group tests its CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that assets might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth rates forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.

indb 80 15 07 2014 12:59 13 Goodwill continued In addition to the annual test of impairment, and as required by IAS 36, there has also been an assessment as to whether there has been any indication that an impairment loss of other non-current assets recognised in an earlier year has decreased or no longer exists.
The impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in May 2014 using growth rates of 1% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 9.6% for the UK CGU and 9.9% for the Spain CGU.
The projected terminal value is calculated based on the Gordon Growth Model assuming cash flows are generated into perpetuity.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment of other non-current assets previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
In the prior year, the impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2013 using growth rates of 1% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 9.9% for the UK CGU and 11.2% for the Spain CGU.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
The value in use assessment is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible changes to the assumptions used for either the UK CGU or Spanish CGU resulted in an additional impairment charge being required.

Property loans All property loans related to land and buildings held in Spain and were accounted for as finance lease obligations.
The loans were secured on the properties to which they related.
At 30 April 2014, the average remaining lease term was one year and the average borrowing rate was 2.0%.
Confirming facilities Spanish confirming facilities of 814,000 2013 1,413,000 are unsecured and all fall due within one year.
It is common practice in Spain for businesses to have a bank facility which enables their suppliers to be paid earlier than under normal credit terms.
When this is the case the supplier pays to Northgate Espaas bank a discount fee for early settlement.
When invoices fall due for payment, Northgate Espaa settles such invoices with its bank.
The Group pays no interest on confirming.
Total borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities at the balance sheet date, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, are as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Less than one year 8,172 7,262 In one year to five years 64,617 58,197 72,789 65,459 The total amount permitted to be borrowed by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in terms of the Articles of Association shall not exceed six times the aggregate of the issued share capital of the Company and Group reserves, as defined in those Articles.

indb 87 15 07 2014 12:59 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Borrowings continued Financial instruments see also Note 37 Financial assets The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk associated with trade receivables in Spain is more concentrated in larger customers than the UK and, consequently, as in the UK the Group has a credit insurance policy in place to mitigate this risk.
Treasury policies and the management of risk The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably.
Treasury operations manage the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only.
Consistent with Group policy, Group Treasury does not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using more complex financial instruments.
Further details regarding derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 22.
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only minimal exposures, with banks and other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to major credit rating agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed and which maintain an A rating.
Individual aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk The Groups policy is to finance operating subsidiary undertakings by a combination of retained earnings and medium term bank loans.
Cash at bank and on deposit yield interest based principally on interest rate indices applicable to periods of less than three months, those indices being LIBOR for Sterling denominated cash and EURIBOR for Euro denominated cash.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives as detailed in Note 22.
These derivatives are also used to manage the Groups desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the interest cost on outstanding debt.
At 30 April 2014 79.8% 2013 0.5% of net borrowings were at fixed rates of interest comprising interest rate swaps of 105,000,000 and 206,500,000, 500,000 of preference shares and 814,000 of confirming facilities 30 April 2013 500,000 of preference shares and 1,413,000 of confirming facilities, as detailed in Note 22.
Foreign currency exchange risk The Group maintains borrowings in the same currency as its cash requirements, with the exception of borrowings maintained in Euro as net investment hedges against its Euro denominated investments Note 22 as explained above.

The Groups borrowing facilities were restructured on 29 April 2013 on which date all the then existing interest rate and cross-currency swaps were cancelled.
New interest rate swaps were entered into on 2 May 2013.
The Group was therefore not party to any interest rate derivatives at 30 April 2013.
Additional interest rate hedging was executed in April 2014.

These had weighted average pay rates of 0.68% and 0.48% respectively and all had weighted average lives of 3.6 years.
In April 2014, 50,000,000 of interest rate swaps commenced.
These had weighted average pay rates of 1.40% and weighted average lives of 3.2 years.
During the prior year the following transactions relating to interest rate derivatives occurred: 25,000,000 and 152,832,000 of interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 2.44% and 2.35% matured: 25,000,000 of interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract receive rate of 1.13% matured: 76,416,000 of interest rate swaps which were entered into in the year ended 30 April 2011 commenced with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 3.12% and a weighted average life of 2.0 years: 76,416,000 of interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 3.12% and a remaining weighted average life of 1.4 years were cancelled at a cash cost of 2,709,000.
This was in connection with the extinguishment of bank debt: and 100,000,000 Sterling interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 3.62% and weighted average remaining life of 8.0 years were cancelled at a cash cost of 16,841,000.
This was in connection with the early repayment of the other loan.
All the Groups interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and their fair value to the point of either maturity or termination, along with changes in fair value in the current year, has been deferred in equity.
To the extent that the interest rate swaps are not 100% effective, a net amount of Nil 2013 12,000 has been credited to the income statement Note 8.
The total change in fair values of interest rate derivatives credited to the income statement of Nil 2013 445,000 is shown within finance costs Note 8.
Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps In April 2013 the Group made early repayment of all outstanding US Dollar denominated loan notes with a capital value of $178,502,000 with total repayments in the year of $249,837,000.
During the period in which these US Dollar denominated notes were in issue they bore fixed rate interest in US Dollars.
The payment of this interest and the capital repayment of the loan notes at maturity exposed the Group to foreign exchange risk.
To mitigate this risk, the Group previously entered into a series of Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps.
The effective start dates and termination dates of these contracts were the same as the loan notes against which hedging relationships were designated and which are shown in Note 21.

indb 90 15 07 2014 12:59 22 Derivative financial instruments continued The Group had interest cash outflows in Sterling and interest cash inflows in US Dollars over the life of the contracts.
On the termination date of each of the contracts, the Group paid a principal amount in Sterling and received a principal amount in US Dollars.
The weighted average interest rate that the Group paid in Sterling in the prior year was 8.86%.
All the Groups Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps entered into in September 2009 were designated and were highly effective as cash flow hedges and their fair value to the point of either maturity or termination, along with changes in fair value in the current year, were deferred in equity.
To the extent that the cross-currency swaps were not 100% effective, a net amount of 368,000 was charged to the income statement Note 8.
In November 2012 cross-currency swaps with a total notional amount of $71,335,000 matured.
In April 2013 cross-currency swaps with a total notional amount of $178,502,000 and weighted average remaining life of 2.4 years were cancelled with a cash outflow of $400,000.
Euro Sterling cross-currency swaps In November 2012, cross currency swaps with a total notional amount of 27,623,000 matured.
In April 2013 the Group cancelled all remaining Euro Sterling cross-currency swaps with a total notional value of 114,157,000.
The Group had interest cash inflows in Sterling and interest cash outflows in Euro over the life of the contract.
On termination date of the contract, the Group paid a principal amount in Euro and received a principal amount in Sterling.

This matched the exchange difference on retranslation of the loan notes at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, leaving a net impact of Nil in the income statement.
The gross exchange difference on retranslation of the loan notes at the exchange rate prevailing at 30 April 2013 was a loss of 68,000.
In addition, the amount included the amortisation of the interest legs of the terminated swaps over their residual life.
The amount recycled to the translation reserve represented the movement on the foreign exchange elements of the total fair value of the derivative subsequent to the designation of the Euro Sterling swap as a net investment hedge.
The net fair value remaining in the hedging reserve represented the fair value of the interest rate element of the derivatives Note 29.
Net investment hedges The Group manages its exposure to currency fluctuations on retranslation of the balance sheets of those subsidiary undertakings whose functional currency is in Euro by maintaining a proportion of its borrowings in the same currency.
In addition in prior years, the Group entered into a number of Sterling Euro cross-currency swaps which were designated as net investment hedges.
The hedging objective is to reduce the risk of spot retranslation of the Euro subsidiaries from Euro to Sterling at each reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the borrowings and net investment hedges have been recognised directly within equity along with the exchange differences on retranslation of the net assets of the Euro subsidiaries.

Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 24 to 32.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 21 and 22.

Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities within the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate liabilities and related derivatives.
For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over the period and average rate applicable for the period.

Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal fixed interest rate amount Fair value Outstanding receive floating pay 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 fixed contracts % % 000 000 000 000 Sterling In the third to fifth years inclusive 1.02% 105,000 685 Euro In the third to fifth years inclusive 0.48% 206,500 637 Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 21 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
All interest cash flows and the weighted average effective interest rate have been calculated using interest rate conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.

All the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate swaps and cross-currency derivatives, are held at fair value.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.

This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, approximately 355,000 2013 685,000 is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no customers who represent more than five per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK and Spain.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 6,407,000 2013 7,088,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and mainly unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
