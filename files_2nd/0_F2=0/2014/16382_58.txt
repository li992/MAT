COMBINED EARNINGS PER SHARE The combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury stock.
In calculating diluted earnings per share and core earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares in the year 2038 of shares in a group company refer below and ii the exercise of share options by employees.
On 19 May 2014, a subsidiary of Unilever PLC purchased the shares convertible to ordinary shares in 2038 see note 24.
Due to the repurchase, the average number of combined share units is not adjusted for these shares from 20 May 2014 to 31 December 2014.
The adjusted average number of share units is calculated based on the number of days the shares were dilutive during the year ended 31 December 2014.
