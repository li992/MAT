The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash fl ows within the cash-generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related 01 expenditure and loan impairment rates.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that refl ect current market conditions, adjusted for the specifi c risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash fl ow forecasts are based on the most recent fi financial budgets for the next fi financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to fi five years, adjusted for expected futureevents.

Goodwill continued UK, Europe and Australia The three most signifi cant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management, Kensington and Investec Wealth & Investment IWI which now includes the business of Williams fide Bro acquired in 2012 as part of the Evolution Group which was merged with IWI in August 2012.
For IWI goodwill of 236.3 million has been supported by a test for impairment on the basis of the cash fl ow projections for the next three years discounted at 10.3% 2013: 10.4% which incorporate an expected revenue growth rate of2.0% March 2013: 2.0%.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out and it has been concluded that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause an impairment to be recognised.
For Investec Asset Management, the fair valuation calculation based on the value placed on the business in the sale completed in July 2013 of 15% of the company to management comfortably supports the value of the goodwill of 88 million.
As announced on 6 February 2014, Investec is in the process of exploring a sale of Kensington.
The sale process is ongoing and there are no indications from this process that there is any impairment of the goodwill of 39.7 million.
As announced on 11 April 2014, Investec is selling Investec Bank Australia Limiteds IBAL Professional Finance Experian, Asset Finance and deposit-taking businesses.
The price agreed is a premium of A$210 million approximately 116 million to net assets.
A signifi cant proportion of the goodwill Investec is carrying in relation to IBAL relates to the Professional Finance and Asset Finance businesses and is supported by the sale premium.
The balance of goodwill in Australia mainly relates to the Investment Banking business and following an assessment at year end apartial impairment of A$20 million 11.2 million has been taken in respect of this.
South Africa The majority of the goodwill attributed to the South African operations relate to Investec Asset Management, particularly to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identifi ed as a separate cash-generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account profi tability, being the current year profi ts and the budgeted profi ts and funds under management.
The discount rate applied of 14.47% is determined using the South African risk-free rate adjusted for therisk related to the cash-generating unit.
