At that point 10% of Redefine International Fund Managers Europe Limited RIFME was held by noncontrolling interests and so on acquisition the NCI was recognised based on their proportionate interest in the assets and liabilities of RIFME Note 40.
Subsequently the Group acquired the remaining 10% of the issued share capital.
This acquisition was settled by the issue of 444,754 shares of 8p each in the share capital of the Company resulting in a loss on the acquisition of noncontrolling interests of 0.16m.
The Company through its 71% held subsidiary RHH, acquired the remaining 40% of the issued shares in BNRI Earls Court Limited BNRI for a purchase consideration of 6.3m.
This resulted in a gain on the acquisition of noncontrolling interests of 0.34m.
2 The decrease in noncontrolling interests relates to the repayment of certain shareholder loans by Ciref Europe Limited.
3 The increase in noncontrolling interests in Redefine Hotel Holdings Limited arose as a result of the capitalisation of certain loans given to that company by the noncontrolling shareholders and the issue of additional shares in the entity to them.
In 2013 the Group acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests in Newington House Limited, Ciref Malthurst Limited and Trito KwikFit Limited for an aggregate purchase price of 1,992,223.
The purchase price has been settled by the issue of 5,108,290 shares of 8p each in the share capital of the Company to the noncontrolling interests shareholders at a price of 39p per consideration share.
