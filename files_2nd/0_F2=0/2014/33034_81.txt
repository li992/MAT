Intangible assets continued Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services, BT Business and BT Consumer.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows BT Global Services BT Business BT Consumer Total m m m m At 1 April 2012 1,082 192 65 1,339 Acquisitions note 14 33 33 Disposals 8 8 Exchange dierences 43 3 46 At 1 April 2013 1,117 228 65 1,410 Acquisitions note 14 15 15 Disposals and adjustments 12 12 Exchange dierences 75 7 82 At 31 March 2014 1,030 221 80 1,331 The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2013 14 was 9.6% 2012 13 8.8% for all CGUs.
The perpetuity growth rate for BT{Global Services was 2.5% 2012 13 2.5% and 2.0% 2012 13 2.0% for BT Business and BT Consumer.
Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash ow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three-year period and a further two years approved by the line of business and group senior management team.
They reect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash ows are also adjusted downwards to reect the dierent risk attributes of each CGU.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that sector.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
Impact of the simplication of our internal trading model on the goodwill impairment review As set out in note 1 on page 127, eective from 1 April 2013 we have made a number of changes that simplify our internal trading and more closely align our line of business financial results and our regulatory accounts.
These changes impacted the cash ow projections for BT Global Services, BT Business and BT Consumer used in the annual goodwill impairment review.
They resulted in an increase in operating cash ows of BT Global Services of 206m in 2012 13 and 208m in 2011 12.
Sensitivities There is significant headroom in all CGUs.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 2,826m.
The{following changes in isolation in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.5% assumption applied to a revised assumption of a perpetual decline rate of 9% or more an increase in the discount rate from the 9.6% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 16% or more shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in perpetuity operating cash ow decreasing by 350m or more.
For BT Business and BT Consumer no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
