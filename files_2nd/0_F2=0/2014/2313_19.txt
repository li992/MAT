Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information a Overview Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom Registration number 05145685.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and Directors Reports.
b Basis of accounting In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 28 March 2014 adopted IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c Basis of consolidation On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in a share-for-share transaction.
Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital.
As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March.
Following the transaction, the Companys continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Giant Topco Limited.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control.
Accordingly, the combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i. e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
During the prior period, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited Makro which has two subsidiaries: Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited.
The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in accordance with undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way.
As a result, the Group had neither control nor significant influence over Makro, and therefore it had not met the requirements for consolidation as set out in IFRS3 revised Business Combinations and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
In accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the investment was held as an available for sale financial asset.
Cash subsequently advanced from Makro at the prior year end was shown within creditors.
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received from the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro has been consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.
See note 9 for more details.
58 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements d Accounting standards adopted in the period The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations: Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans 2011 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 2010 As a result of IAS 19 2011, the Group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related to the defined benefit pension scheme.
Under IAS 19 2011, the Group determines the net interest expense income for the period on the net defined benefit liability asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Previously, the Group determined interest income on plan assets based on their long term rate of expected return.

59 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
General information continued f Going concern The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed.
In particular, the Groups performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions.
Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated a new unsecured bank facility of 120m for a period of 5 years.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements.
g Use of assumptions and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for: IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The acquisition accounting in relation to Makro Holding Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Directors are required to fair value both Makros assets and liabilities and the consideration paid at the date of consolidation.
This requires significant judgements to be made especially with regard to property valuations.
IAS37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do so.
Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any for the period up until the point it is judged that the lease will no longer be onerous.
In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties.
The Directors believe that their estimates, which are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate.
Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations.
In testing for impairment of goodwill, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity.
Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
At 28 March 2014, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired.
In applying the Groups accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are required to make assumptions regarding the Groups ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely quantum and timing of future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident that the Groups future profits will utilise historical tax assets.

Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Intangible assets a Business combinations and goodwill Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b Other intangibles Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years and charged to administrative expenses.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Employee benefits a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The defined benefit obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs.
In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006, the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
61 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued c Short term benefits Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Financial instruments Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
c Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d Interest-bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Costs associated with extending the bank facility have been recognised in the income statement.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
62 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Guarantees Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These are measured and recognised at fair value.
These property guarantees are included within Provisions on the balance sheet.
Impairment The carrying values of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or the replacement cost and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location less supplier volume rebates.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity method of accounting.
The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities post tax profit or loss within the income statement and its share of the net assets within investments.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
Other investments As stated in the basis of consolidation, the investment in Makro was shown in the prior period in other investments and represented an available-for-sale financial asset and is held at fair value.
Competition Commission clearance was received on 19 April 2013, since then Makro has been treated as a subsidiary.
Leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term.
The total amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge changes.
The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within Accruals and deferred income.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
63 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Operating Segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the CEO.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation in IFRS 8 are met.
These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics: similar nature of products and services: similar type or class of customers: similar methods used to distribute products or provide services: and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways for example by customer and product types, by delivery channels and between Booker Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, Classic Drinks, Ritter-Courivaud and Makro.
However, none of these possible segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and distribution channels, and there are a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets liabilities that are not specific.
It is therefore not possible to analyse, and the CEO does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the same way in which turnover is analysed.
Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CEO focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and report the results and financial position on an IFRS basis.
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the possible segments, which in any event would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS 8, separately in these financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the Extra business centre conversions have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 30 years Leasehold improvements lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years Plant and equipment 320 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Revenue Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax.
Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned.
Provision is made for expected customer returns.
64 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements Share based payments The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve.
This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, taking into account service conditions and market performance.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Supplier rebates Supplier allowances and credits are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned according to the underlying agreement.
Allowances consist primarily of promotional allowances, quantity discounts and payments under merchandising agreements.
Amounts received under promotional or other merchandising allowance agreements that require specific performance are recognised when the performance is satisfied, the amount is fixed and determinable and the collection is reasonably assured.
Taxation Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets excluding goodwill and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Other than the operation in India, all of the Groups revenue originates from the UK.
The functional currency of the Indian operation is Rupees.
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers.

As Makro was not consolidated until 19 April 2013, and it is group policy not to pay for group relief, the benefit of the prior year trading losses tax value of 4.0m has been accounted for as a permanent difference in the Groups prior year tax charge.
A tax credit of 0.7m arises on the net exceptional credit of 3.4m, which is after taking account of a charge arising from the revaluation of Makros deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date, following enactment on 2 July 2013 of reduced future rates of corporation tax.
The effective rate of tax on profit after exceptional items becomes 13.8% 2013: 17.5%.

Further reductions to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the deferred tax assets liabilities at 28 March 2014 which has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval.
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.

Business combination continued The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities as at 19 April 2013: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Property, plant and equipment 142.2 12.4 154.6 Inventories 67.8 67.8 Trade and other receivables 10.6 10.6 Trade and other payables 81.2 3.0 84.2 Bank overdraft 7.9 7.9 Deferred tax 15.2 15.2 Net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 131.5 24.6 156.1 Gain on bargain purchase included in exceptional items 11.2 Total consideration 144.9 The fair value adjustments made on acquisition have had the effect of: increasing the property valuations: providing for onerous contracts: and recognising a deferred tax asset in relation to accelerated capital allowances.
The fair value of the consideration is based upon the fair value of the investment held in Makro prior to the date of consolidation.
The investment was measured at fair value in accordance with IAS39 as it was an available for sale financial asset.
The fair value was initially determined by reference to the consideration transferred as set out below at completion, and the subsequent fair value was considered to be unchanged at both 29 March 2013 and 19 April 2013 and therefore there has been no valuation gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income.
The subsequent investment fair value was measured by reference to the performance of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets of the business, predominantly properties.
Consideration for purchase of investment comprised of: m Issue of 156,621,525 new ordinary shares determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc 124.2 at the date of completion, taking into account a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from being sold for one year after the date of completion Cash consideration 15.8 Cash paid to reflect a targeted cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012 4.9 144.9 The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is higher than the fair value of consideration paid, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of 11.2m, which has been included in exceptional items.
The Directors considered whether this indicated inappropriate fair values underlying the acquisition accounting and concluded that all the fair values were reasonable.
In the 49 weeks to 28 March 2014, Makro contributed turnover of 599m and, after synergies, a profit before interest, tax and exceptional items of 11m.
If the acquisition had occurred at the start of the reporting period, turnover would have been 632m with profit before interest, tax and exceptional items of 10.7m.

Goodwill arose in the Group from the following: the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in 2005: and the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in 2010.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to test its fixed assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.
Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intagible fixed assets and tangible fixed assets contained in each cash generating unit CGU with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre tax cash flow projections of each CGU based on the Groups approved budget for 2015 and plan for 2016.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2013: 2%, being the Directors estimated view of the long term compound growth in the economy.
This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term business.
The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with their expectations of the market.
The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together with the Directors estimations of its market share and competitive pressures.
Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities.
Expenses are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.
72 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements The Directors believe that three CGUs now exist within the Group: a Ritter intangible assets of 12.6m and tangible assets of 1.0m A pre tax discount rate of 10.4% 2013: 10.5% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
With all other assumptions held constant, neither a 5% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 5%, would require an impairment to be made.
b Makro tangible assets of 133.6m The majority of Makros assets relate to freehold and leasehold property which were fair valued on consolidation.
c Remaining business intangible assets of 426.1m and tangible assets of 69.9m A pre tax discount rate of 10.5% 2013: 10.8% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
With all other assumptions held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10%, would require an impairment to be made.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of fixed assets is supported are reasonable and that no impairment to fixed assets is required.

Makro Holding Limited has two subsidiaries: Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited.
This was held as an investment at 29 March 2013, while the transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in accordance with undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way.
As a result, the Group had neither control nor significant influence over Makro at the previous year end, and therefore it did not meet the requirements for consolidation as set out in IFRS3 revised Business Combinations and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
In accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the investment was initially held as an available for sale financial asset.
Cash that was subsequently advanced from Makro is held within creditors.
The shares issued as consideration for the investment were valued at their fair value of 124.2m, at the date of completion.
Fair value was determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc at the date of completion, taking into account a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from being sold for one year after the date of completion.
In addition a further 4.9m was paid to reflect an above target cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012.
The investment was measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 39 as it is an available-for-sale financial asset.
The fair value of the financial asset subsequent to the date of completion, but prior to consolidation, was measured by reference to the performance of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets in the business, predominantly property.
Full clearance to the transaction was received by the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the date that control passes to the Group.
The fair value of the investment, at the date of consolidation, became the fair value of the consideration in respect of the acquisition, and is considered to be unchanged since the date of completion.

Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of 120m for a period of 5 years.
The revolving credit facility bears floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any drawn facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.
2014 2013 m m Facility available 120.0 120.0 Bank guarantees 7.0 7.0 Undrawn facility available 113.0 113.0 The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 3 years 3 and 4 years 4 years m m m m m 2014 Trade and other payables 600.9 2013 Trade and other payables 500.9 It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual interest payments and the adjustment for non cash items including unamortised borrowing costs.
The undiscounted cash flows for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the balance sheet.
There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature.
Credit risk The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group has an accounting policy to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially drawn for a small part of the year.
Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.
78 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account i. e. share capital and retained earnings.
The Group has 149.6m of net cash as at 28 March 2014 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Groups Indian operation which are denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does not hold any foreign exchange contracts.
Post employment benefits The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees.
Change in accounting policy As a result of IAS 19 2011, the Group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related to the defined benefit pension scheme as described in note 1.
Defined contribution schemes Pension contributions of 5.0m 2013: 3.5m were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period.
Included within accruals is 0.4m 2013: 0.3m of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Booker Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded pension arrangement based on final salary and was closed to new entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002.
However, active members benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by independent fund managers appointed by the Trustees.
The benefit obligations as at 28 March 2014 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS 19 basis using the results of the 31 March 2013 triennial actuarial valuation which has then been updated to 28 March 2014.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.

h Contributions to be paid The Trustees have recently completed their 31 March 2013 triennial valuation of the Scheme.
The Trustees assessed the funding position to be a shortfall of approximately 24m at this date.
This shortfall is expected to be recovered through Company deficit contributions 9.6m of deficit contributions were paid into the Scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014 and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme.
Of the 9.6m paid to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2014, 2.4m was paid on 31 March 2014, in the next reporting period.
No further contributions to the Scheme are expected to be made until the funding position is reviewed following the next actuarial valuation of Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016.
