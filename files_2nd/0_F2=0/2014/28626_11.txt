Our consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is much higher than the banking industry norm.
This reflects the low-risk nature of our banking activity and our lack of debt financing.
The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio has fallen to 17.7% from 21.0% at the previous year end mainly due to an increase in intangible assets following the purchase of part of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Managements London-based private client investment management business and acquisition of Jupiter Asset Managements private client and charity investment management business, partially offset by the proceeds from the placing of 1.3 million shares in April.
The consolidated leverage ratio was 7.5% at 31 December 2014, down from 11.5% at 31 December 2013: this fall is due to the growth in the balance sheet and the increase in intangible assets, which have reduced Common Equity Tier 1 capital.
The leverage ratio represents the groups Common Equity Tier 1 capital as a percentage of its total assets, excluding intangible assets and investment in associates, plus a proportion of off balance sheet exposures.

Capital expenditure During 2014, we have continued to invest for future growth with capitalised expenditure on our premises and systems totalling 4.6 million 2013: 4.5 million.
Investment in new systems continues at a steady pace as we continue to improve the efficiency of our systems and our back office.
Although some of this is driven by regulatory change, much is driven by our desire to optimise the service that our clients receive and to give our investment managers the tools they need to manage portfolios more easily.
New investment accounted for approximately 70% of capital expenditure in 2014, with the balance being maintenance and replacement of existing software and equipment.
This split is broadly consistent with the spending pattern in the recent past, although there was only very limited expenditure on property during the year.
In 2015, we expect capital expenditure to remain at 2014 levels as we continue to invest in our internet portal for clients and advisers as part of our ongoing endeavours to improve and develop the business.
