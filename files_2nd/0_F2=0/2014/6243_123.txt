The exploration services provided by the exploration companies listed in note 4 and projects under development have been aggregated into the Other segment below.
Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation.
Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines.
The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the consolidated income statement.
Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments.
Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
In 2014 and 2013 substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.
