18 Financial instruments The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Group businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The Groups businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend.
To accommodate the significant free cash ow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the overall debt portfolio is typically kept short term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and sufficient capacity under committed credit lines.
The treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring a that no more than $1.5bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, b that the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus commercial paper is less thanthe sum of available cash plus committed facilities and c minimum levels of borrowing with maturities over three and five years are maintained.
The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by a targeting certain levels of commercial paper across a given year, b maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately 5 years and c minimising surplus cash balances.
From time to time, based on cash ow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase outstanding debt in the open market.
Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currency that is needed.
It is recognised that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings and net assets in currencies other than the reporting currencies.
For this reason, a significant proportion of the Groups net debt has historically been denominated in US dollars, reecting the size and importance of the US businesses.
There were no changes to the Groups long-term approach to capital and liquidity management during the year.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash ows and includes contractual gross cash ows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.
