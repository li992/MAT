46 Beazley Annual report 2014 Financial review Balance sheet management Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $62.0m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.7m, US admitted licences of $9.3m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $12.6m.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $860.7m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $192.5m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $195.0m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $665.7m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium tail.
The chart on page 47 shows the profile of these assets based on their S&P rating at the end of 2014: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2014 our provision had reduced to $14.1m 2013: $14.5m in respect of reinsurance recoveries, following a partial recovery during the year in relation to Lehman Re.
Insurance receivables Insurance receivables are amounts receivable from brokers in respect of premiums written.
The balance at 31 December 2014 was $587.0m, a decrease of 5% compared to 2013 $617.7m.
We continue to outsource the majority of the collection of our Lloyds broker premium balances to Randall and Quilter Investment Holdings plc, which operates within the Lloyds market as a specialist credit controller, the remainder of the balances are controlled and monitored internally.
Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the financial statements.
The largest items included comprise: deferred acquisition costs of $222.7m: profit commissions of $11.4m and other balances of $7.3m receivable from syndicate 623: and deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $9.0m.

Our UPR has increased by 7% to $1,022.5m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid of $984.7m and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR of $2,540.2m.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves have decreased by 3% to $3,524.9m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises three long term debt facilities: in 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
In 2013 we bought back 26.2m of this debt.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the nominal value of this debt as at 31 December 2014 is 76.5m 2013: 76.5m : a US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US$ London interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009: and during September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250m euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and is due in 2019.
This diversified the source and maturity profile of the groups debt financing.
A syndicated short term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group Plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
Of this, $175m may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.6% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.75% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will expire on 31 December 2016, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
com 48 Beazley Annual report 2014 Financial review Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
We comply with all IGD requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company Inc. We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an on going basis in light of the current regulatory framework, and expected changes in regulation, i. e. Solvency II and opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However, there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
In 2014, Beazley acquired 3.1m of its own shares into the employee benefit trust.
These were acquired at an average price of 245.0p and the cost to the group was 7.5m.
The following table sets out the groups sources of funds: 2014 2013 $m $m Shareholders funds 1,342.7 1,338.7 Tier 2 subordinated debt 2026 122.5 132.1 Retail bond 2019 115.8 123.0 Long term subordinated debt 2034 18.0 18.0 1,599.0 1,611.8 Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity on a Solvency II basis alongside $122.5m of tier 2 subordinated debt, $18.0m subordinated long term debt, a $115.8m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225.0m.

We will therefore be paying a special dividend of 11.8p, reducing the surplus to 20% which is within our current target range 15% to 25% of ECR.
Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
The current capital assessment has been established using our Solvency II internal model which has been run within the ICA regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to determine the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
Solvency II It is now confirmed that the Solvency II regime will be implemented from 1 January 2016, with the passing of the Omnibus II Directive by the European Parliament in 2014.
We welcome this definitive start date and, while some final detail of requirements remains to be confirmed, we believe that we are strongly positioned for full compliance.
Beazleys programme to prepare for Solvency II began in 2008 and will remain in place through to completion.
Beazley, having indicated to the Central Bank of Ireland CBI the intention to seek approval to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement using a group internal model, has been engaging with the CBI in a pre-application review.
This was materially completed in 2014 and we are on track to submit a formal application for approval at the earliest opportunity, in April 2015.
During 2014, Beazley has continued to benefit from participation in the Lloyds Solvency II programme and the use of the internal model for Lloyds capital setting has been a strong driver for the embedding of the model into business as usual.
