b For the purposes of this analysis, free surplus for asset management operations and the UK general insurance commission is taken to be IFRS basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity.
c Non-operating items are principally short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the effect of changes in economic assumptions for long-term business operations.
d Net cash flows to parent company for long-term business operations reflect the flows as included in the holding company cash flow at transaction rates.
e Exchange movements, timing differences and other items represent: 2014 m Asset management and UK general Long-term insurance business commission Total note 13 Exchange movements 134 11 145 note 12 Mark to market value movements on Jackson assets backing surplus and required capital 77 77 Shareholders' share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes 17 1 18 note f Other 16 90 74 210 80 130 f Other primarily reflects the effect of intra-group loans, contingent loan funding as shown in note 13 i, timing differences and other non-cash items.
g Investment in new business includes the annual amortisation charge of amounts incurred to secure exclusive distribution rights through our bancassurance partners at a rate that reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by reference to new business levels.
Included within the overall free surplus balance of the Asia life entities is 304 million representing unamortised amounts incurred to secure exclusive distribution rights through bancassurance partners.
These amounts exclude 883 million of Asia distribution rights intangibles that are financed by loan arrangements from central companies, the costs of which are allocated to the Asia life segment as the amortisation cost is incurred.
