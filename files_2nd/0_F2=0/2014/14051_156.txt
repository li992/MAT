Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty continued Determining whether assets with impairment indicators require an actual impairment involves an estimation of the expected value in use of the asset or CGU to which the asset relates.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of future cash flows and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, both of which involve considerable judgement.
The future cash flows are derived from approved forecasts, with the key assumptions being revenue growth, margins and cash conversion rates.
Discount rates are calculated with reference to the specific risks associated with the assets and are based on advice provided by external experts.
Our calculation of discount rates are performed based on a risk free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to the asset being tested, which is subsequently adjusted to factor in local market risks and risks specific to Serco and the asset itself.
During the year, goodwill associated with four CGUs was determined to be impaired, resulting in an exceptional charge of 466.0m.
In addition, a charge of 44.6m was recognised in respect of certain intangible assets.
A charge of 40.7m was recognised in respect of certain items of property, plant and equipment and 21.6m in respect of billed receivables.
Further details of these impairments can be seen in notes 20, 21, 22 and 24 to the financial statements.
Capitalisation of Internally Generated Intangible Assets When the Group creates an intangible asset where the future economic benefits are greater than the expected costs, the development costs are capitalised if they meet the other requirements of IAS 38, Intangible Assets, as set out in the accounting policies section above.
Revenue and Recognition Calculating the fair value of revenue typically does not require a significant level of judgement, the exceptions to this are the following areas: Uncontracted variations or claims.
Where work has been performed outside of the normal contracting framework at the request of the customer or a claim has been made for work performed but in dispute, judgement is required in order to determine whether there is sufficient certainty that the Group will be financially compensated revenue is only recognised to the extent that they have been orally agreed by the customer or are virtually certain of being received.
When returns are directly linked to performance through cost savings or other customer driven key performance indicators over a period of time an estimate is made of the likelihood of achieving the necessary level of performance when the period covers a financial year end.
Revenue is only recognised when we can be reasonably certain of achieving the required level of performance.
Revenue and profit is recognised for certain long-term project-based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
The assessment of the stage of completion requires the exercise of judgement and is measured by the proportion of costs incurred to estimated whole-life contract costs, except where whole life contract costs exceed the contract value, in which case the excess is expensed immediately.
Separation of Income Statement Items from Underlying Results IAS 1 requires material items to be disclosed separately in a way that enables users to assess the quality of a companys profitability.
In practice, these are commonly referred to as exceptional items, but this is not a concept defined by IFRS and therefore there is a level of judgement involved in determining what to include in underlying profit.
We consider items which are material, non-recurring and outside of the normal operating practice of the Company to be suitable for separate presentation.
Retirement Benefit Obligations The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, inflation rates and future contribution rates see note 34.
The value of net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is an asset of 126.5m 2013: 52.9m.
Details of the impact of changes in assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations are disclosed in note 34.
Assets Classified as Held For Sale The Group has classified several businesses as held for sale in the current year and where appropriate an allocation of goodwill has been made.
This allocation is a best estimate based on indicative offers and these values may change as the deals are finalised.
In addition, customer consent is required in some cases, which is usual and customary for the sale of businesses with outsourcing contracts.
Receipt of these consents is assumed to be highly probable, but this is an area of judgement.
Prior Year Restatement Two prior year adjustments have been made to reflect the restatement of certain financial instruments.
These resulted in a cumulative net charge of 5.6m to prior years reported profits, which included a net credit to the 2013 profit for the year of 3.0m.
These amounts had previously been taken directly to reserves, and as a consequence there was no adjustment required to restate the net assets of the Group as at 31 December 2013 or prior years.
The first adjustment relates to derivatives held by Intelenet at the time of Sercos acquisition of that company in 2011.
Under IFRS 3, in order to achieve hedge accounting at a Group level, these derivatives should have been designated at Serco Group level at that time.
Because the Group designation was not made at that time, they do not qualify for hedge accounting and so the fair value movement on these instruments since 2011, together with the associated tax, has been reclassified to either retained earnings or the income statement.
The second adjustment relates to net investment hedges that should have been designated in 2011.
Because the designations were not made at that time, they do not qualify for hedge accounting and so the fair value movement on these instruments since 2011 has been reclassified to either retained earnings or the income statement.
