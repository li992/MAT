Disposals and closures include liabilities related to the disposal of Penguin.
In 2013 a provision was established for amounts payable to Bertelsmann upon settlement of the transfer of Penguins UK past service pension liabilities to the new Penguin Random House venture.
During 2014 it was decided that this transfer would not go ahead as planned and therefore the provision has been released.
Legal and other includes legal claims, contract disputes and potential contract losses.
