158 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to primary statements B:  B4:  The following features are of particular relevance to the determination of the 2014 results: a  In 2014, the IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for Asia insurance operations included a profit of 49 million 2013: 44 million representing a number of non-recurring items, none of which are individually significant.
b   Jackson applies a mean reversion technique for amortisation of deferred acquisition costs on variable annuity business which dampens the effects of short-term market movements on expected gross profits against which deferred acquisition costs are amortised.
To the extent that the mean reversion methodology does not fully dampen the effects of market returns, there is a charge or credit for accelerated or decelerated amortisation.
For 2014, there was a charge for accelerated amortisation of 13 million 2013: a credit for decelerated amortisation of 82 million to the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
See note C5.1 b for further details.
Other In 2013, Jackson revised its projected long-term separate account return from 8.4 per cent to 7.4 per cent net of external fund management fees.
The effect of this change together with other assumption changes and recalibration of modelling of accounting values of guarantees gave rise to a net benefit of 6 million to profit before tax in 2013. c  Annuitybusiness: For IFRS reporting, the results for UK shareholder-backed annuity business are particularly sensitive to the allowances made for credit risk.
The allowance is reflected in the deduction from the valuation rate of interest for discounting projected future annuity payments to policyholders that would have otherwise applied.

ii Long-term expected defaults are derived by applying Moodys data from 1970 to 2009 and the definition of the credit rating used is the second highest credit rating published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch.
iii Additional provisions comprise credit risk premium, which is derived from Moodys data from 1970 to 2009, an allowance for a one-notch downgrade of the portfolio subject to credit risk and an additional allowance for short-term defaults.
The prudent Pillar 1 regulatory basis reflects the overriding objective of maintaining sufficient provisions and capital to ensure payments to policyholders can be made.
The approach for IFRS aims to establish liabilities that are closer to best estimate.
