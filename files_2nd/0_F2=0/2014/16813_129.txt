Vodafone Group Plc 178 Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued Fair value hedges The Companys policy is to use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings.
The Company designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the profit and loss account for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Pensions The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Vodafone Group pension scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Vodafone Group pension scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance within FRS 17 to account for defined benefit schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognise only the contribution payable each year.
The Company had no contributions payable for the years ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013.
Fixed assets Accounting policies Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
