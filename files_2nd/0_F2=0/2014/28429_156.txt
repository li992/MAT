European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 275 Section 6 European Embedded Value EEV basis results 276 I ndex to EEV basis results Description of EEV basis reporting In broad terms, IFRS profits for long-term business reflect the aggregate of results on a traditional accounting basis.
By contrast, embedded value is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The European Embedded Value principles were published by the CFO Forum of major European insurers in May 2004 and subsequently supplemented by Additional Guidance issued in October 2005.
The principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of long-term business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows, by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits, full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, and takes into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses.
Further details are explained in notes 16 and 17.
