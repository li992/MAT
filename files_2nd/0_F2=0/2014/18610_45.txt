112 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION CONTINUED The majority of the Groups properties are held as trading stock and are therefore shown in the statutory statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
This does not reflect the market value of the assets and, accordingly, our key statement of financial position measures of net asset value include trading stock at market value.
The two principal net asset value measures reviewed by the CODM are Gross net asset value NAV and Triple net asset value NNNAV.
NAV is the statutory net assets plus the adjustment required to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
In addition, the statutory statement of financial position amounts for both deferred tax on property revaluations and derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are added back to statutory net assets.
Finally, the market value of Grainger plc shares owned by the Group are added back to statutory net assets.
NNNAV reverses some of the adjustments made between statutory net assets and NAV.
All of the adjustments for the value of derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are reversed.
The adjustment for the deferred tax on property revaluations is also reversed.
In addition, adjustments are made to net assets to reflect the fair value, net of deferred tax, of the Groups fixed rate debt and to deduct from net assets the contingent tax calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the adjustment to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
These measures are set out below by segment along with a reconciliation to the summarised statutory statement of financial position.
