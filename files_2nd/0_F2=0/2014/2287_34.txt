Business and geographical segments The Group has 188 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services.

In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy ADE and Automotive & General Industrial AGI business areas, as follows: ADE Western Europe: ADE North America: ADE Emerging markets: AGI Western Europe: AGI North America: and AGI Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Groups two key business areas, ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements.
Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector.
