The expected rate is the weighted average rate taking into account the Groups profits in these jurisdictions.
The expected rate has decreased in 2014 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The tax charge for the year is lower 2013: lower than the expected tax charge due to the following factors: 2014 2013 $m $m Profit before taxation from continuing operations excluding profits from joint ventures 445.1 344.9 Loss profit before taxation from discontinued operations 27.3 55.1 Total profit before taxation 417.8 400.0 Profit before tax at expected rate of 27.69% 2013: 29.32% 115.7 117.3 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior years 16.1 0.7 Non-recognition recognition of losses and other attributes 22.5 7.6 Effect of foreign taxes 1.5 6.6 Other permanent differences 9.1 15.6 Total tax charge 111.5 101.4 The deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years relates mainly to timing differences on expenses which are tax deductible when paid.

The impairment tests were carried out against the Groups Cash Generating Units CGU, being the key Strategic Business Units SBUs within the operating divisions, which are aligned with how the Group manages and monitors performance.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management for 2015 and 2016.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three year period.
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated long term growth rate of 3% across all CGUs.
The growth rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

Details of the key assumptions underlying the cash flows are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the Accounting Policies on page 56.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU.
No goodwill has been written off during the current or prior year.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
This analysis did not identify any impairment.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations.

17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-political uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 77 Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Financial instruments continued a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Where possible, the Group's policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
The Group does not have any financial instruments in place to hedge foreign currency movements in its balance sheet.
However, strategies such as payment of intercompany dividends are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Groups largest foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
The potential impact of changes in the sterling US dollar exchange rate is summarised in the table below.
As the Group reports in US dollars a strengthening of the pound has a positive impact on translation of its sterling companies profits and net assets.

The Group also has foreign exchange risk in relation a number of other currencies, in particular, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Norwegian kroner.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and debt.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2014, 89% 2013: 24% of the Group's bank borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The increase during the year is due to the repayment of most of the Groups floating rate debt following the issue of senior loan notes in the US private placement market.
If the senior loan notes are taken into account the percentage of debt at fixed rate increases to 97%.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2014 2013: 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $2.7m lower or higher respectively 2013: $2.4m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups operations comprise Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN, each of which is made up of a number of businesses.
Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency.
Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
There is significant management focus on receivables that are overdue.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
100% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2014 2013: 81% was held with such institutions.
78 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Financial instruments continued c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2014, 89% 2013: 84% of the Groups borrowing facilities were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
During 2014, the Group issued US$375m of unsecured senior loan notes in the US private placement market.
The notes were issued at a mix of 7, 10 and 12 year maturities.
In January 2015, the Group extended its bilateral facilities of $950m to January 2020. d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
These ratios are calculated using the proportionally consolidated figures used for management reporting.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2014 was 22.7 times 2013: 28.7 times.
The ratio of net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2014 was 0.5 2013: 0.5.
Financial liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Drawdowns under the bilateral bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and therefore loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Drawdowns under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

Other provisions At 31 December 2014, other provisions of $44.4m 2013: $34.6m have been recognised.
This amount includes provisions for non-recoverable indirect taxes, provisions for legal claims, and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses.
It is expected that any payment required in respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years.

As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $93.7m 2013: $51.1m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP and the Long Term Plan LTP.
The LTP replaced the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP in 2013.
The charge to operating profit in 2014 for these schemes amounted to $17.4m 2013: $22.4m.
$18.2m 2013: $21.0m relating to the charge has been credited to retained earnings and $0.8m 2013: $1.4m charge has been deducted from liabilities reflecting a credit to operating profit for the year in respect of 2013 true-ups to the LTCIP, which is a cash settled scheme.
In addition, accelerated charges of $4.8m have been booked to exceptional items in the period relating to employees who transferred to the EthosEnergy joint venture.
$1.3m of this amount is credited to equity and $3.5m, representing the cash amount payable to former Group employees in compensation for loss of the options, is credited to non-current liabilities.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below.
ESOS and LTRP For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 20% for ESOS and 25% for LTRP.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was in place from 2008 to 2012.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives were awarded shares or share options dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the LTIP were EBITA, OCER ratio of operating capital employed to revenue, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
20% of any award earned over the three year performance cycle is deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
Long Term Plan The Groups Long Term Plan LTP was introduced during 2013 to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP.
Two distinct awards will be made under LTP.
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under the LTRP see above.
Awards to former LTIP and LTCIP participants will be made on a broadly similar basis to LTIP with the performance measures being EBITA, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Participants may be granted conditional share awards or nil cost options at the start of the cycle.
Performance is measured over a three year period and up to 80% of an award may vest based on the performance over that period.
The vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally deferred for a further period of at least two years.
Performance based awards Details of the LTIP LTP awards are set out in the table below.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
Further details of the LTIP LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

The options issuable under cycle 5 are estimated based on anticipated achievement against the set targets.
Further details on the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
LTCIP The share based charge for the LTCIP for cycle 4 and 5 was calculated using a fair value of 5.95 2013: 6.62.
The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above.
Payments under the LTCIP are linked to movements in the Groups share price.

The table reflects payments in respect of deferred and contingent consideration made in relation to acquisitions in prior periods.
During the year the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Agility Projects AS, 100% of the share capital of Cape Software Inc, 100% of the share capital of Sunstone Projects Ltd and 100% of the share capital of Swaggart Brothers Inc.
The Group also acquired the assets of Meesters.
Due to its size, the acquisition of Agility Projects AS is considered material and has been presented separately in the table above.
The other acquisitions are not considered to be material on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated above.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups resources to further grow and develop their businesses.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
Provisional fair value adjustments of $27.6m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in the year.
Other provisional fair value adjustments of $2.8m have also been recorded.
Trade and other receivables acquired of $87.4m are expected to be recovered in full.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents in respect of acquisitions is analysed as follows: $m Cash consideration 267.8 Cash acquired 13.6 Borrowings acquired 8.7 Cash outflow 262.9 Included in the cash outflow above are deferred and contingent consideration payments of $40.8m made during the year in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods and $4.8m in respect of the acquisition of non-controlling interests.

$m Total Revenue 7,820.0 Total EBITA 569.8 From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014, the acquisitions contributed $125.0m to revenue and $9.8m to EBITA.
Divestments In May 2014, the Groups joint venture with Siemens, EthosEnergy Group Limited was formed.
Whilst the Group has a 51% shareholding in the new entity, all significant decision making requires unanimous consent from both parties and therefore the Group does not have control and the new company is accounted for as a joint venture.
The transaction was accounted for under IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures as follows -: $m $m Book value of net assets transferred to EthosEnergy 541.8 Cash received and receivable 157.4 Net assets disposed 384.4 Value of the Groups investment in EthosEnergy 384.4 - Disposal costs Cumulative foreign exchange losses recycled through the income statement 7.0 Accelerated share based charges 4.8 Legal and other costs 11.2 23.0 Net impact of transaction included in exceptional items per note 4 23.0 The value of the Groups investment in EthosEnergy represents the fair value of the net assets disposed.
Under the joint venture agreement the Group received a 51% ownership interest in EthosEnergy and EthosEnergy was required to pay the Group $70.0m, of which $21.0m was paid during 2014.
In addition, an estimated $87.4m is payable by EthosEnergy in respect of post close adjustments for items including working capital and indebtedness at the date of formation.
$37.6m of this amount was received during 2014.
Foreign exchange losses of $7.0m which were recorded in the currency translation reserve in prior years have been recycled through the income statement as required by IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Further details of the accelerated share based charges are provided in note 20.
The results of the Wood Group businesses transferred to EthosEnergy are shown as profit from discontinued operations in the Group income statement.
EBITA losses for the four month period were $1.7m, operating losses after deducting the $23.0m disposal costs above were $27.3m, and losses after tax were $25.9m.
Cash outflows from discontinued operations amounted to $24.3m, comprising $12.7m operating cash outflows, $7.1m investing cash outflows and $4.5m financing cash outflows.
At 31 December 2013 the assets and liabilities that the Group anticipated transferring to EthosEnergy were classified as held for sale.
During the year, the Group disposed of one of its South American businesses for net proceeds of $1.7m.
No gain or loss was recorded on the transaction, the net assets having already been written down in 2013.

29 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans.
The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
From April 2007 members accrued benefits under the scheme on a CARE Career Averaged Revalued Earnings basis.
On 30 June 2014, the scheme was closed to future accrual.
A past service gain of 4.0m $6.7m arose as a result of the closure of the scheme and this amount has been credited to administrative expenses in the income statement.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 by a professionally qualified actuary.
On closure of the scheme to future accrual, 7.5m was paid by the Group to reduce the scheme deficit.
The Group has also agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of 1.7m per annum from 2014 until 2021.
At 31 December 2014, there were no active members 2013: 241, 330 pensioners 2013: 286 and 837 deferred members 2013: 654 of the scheme.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2014 2013 % % Discount rate 3.6 4.5 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries N A 5.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.4 Rate of retail price index inflation 3.1 3.4 Rate of consumer price index inflation 2.3 2.6 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 89 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued At 31 December 2014, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider UK wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using up to date projections.
The mortality assumption can be fully described as PXA00 CMI 2012 1.25%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2014 2013 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 293.1 267.1 Fair value of scheme assets 266.1 225.9 Net liabilities 27.0 41.2 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 $m % $m % Equity securities 201.4 75.7 196.8 87.1 Corporate bonds 18.4 6.9 17.8 7.9 Gilts 19.4 7.3 8.1 3.6 Annuity policies 7.2 2.7 - - Cash 19.7 7.4 3.2 1.4 266.1 100.0 225.9 100.0 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2014 2013 $m $m Current service cost included within employee benefits expense 3.5 7.5 Past service gain 6.7 - Interest cost 12.0 10.8 Interest income on scheme assets 10.2 8.4 Total included within finance expense 1.8 2.4 The employee benefits expense and past service gain are included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

Scheme risks The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are Volatility The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a deficit, all other things being equal.
The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation.
This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase in the value of the schemes bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members life expectancies will increase the defined benefit obligation, all other things being equal.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 91 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Retirement benefit obligations continued Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below.
The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Assumption Change Impact on obligation Discount rate 0.1% $5.8m Rate of retail prices index inflation 0.1% $3.3m Rate of consumer price index inflation 0.1% $1.2m Life expectancy 1 year $7.5m Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans were as follows: 2014 2013 $m $m Defined contribution plans 89.6 92.8 There were no material contributions outstanding at 31 December 2014 in respect of defined contribution plans.

The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases vehicles, plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
31 Contingent liabilities At the balance sheet date the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries.
The Group is aware of potential legal challenges which may affect historic and future employment costs and may have an impact on the Group.
At this point it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the liability, if any, that may arise and therefore no provision has been made.
From time to time and in the normal course of business the Group is notified of legal claims in respect of work carried out.
Management believe that the Group is in a strong position to defend these claims.
In addition, the Group is currently cooperating with investigations in relation to facilities where it provides or previously provided services.
Management do not believe that it is probable that any material liability will arise from any of these matters.
