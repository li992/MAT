284 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 4 Operating profit from business in force continued Notes a The decrease in unwind of discount and other expected returns of 20 million from 668 million for 2013 to 648 million for 2014 is impacted by the effect of lower interest rates of 55 million, and a 61 million adverse foreign currency translation effect, partially offset by 96 million mainly for the increase in the opening in-force value.
b In 2014, the credit of 27 million for mortality and morbidity assumption changes reflects a number of offsetting items, including the effect of reduced projected mortality rates for Hong Kong.
In 2013, the credit of 19 million mainly reflected the beneficial effect arising from the renegotiation of a reinsurance agreement in Indonesia.
c In 2014, the charge of 17 million for persistency assumptions mainly reflects increased partial withdrawal assumptions on unit-linked business in Korea.
For 2013, the charge of 23 million reflected a number of offsetting items including the effect of strengthening lapse and premium holiday assumptions in Korea.
d In 2014, the credit of 47 million for other assumption changes reflects a number of offsetting items, including the effects of modelling improvements and those arising from asset allocation changes in Hong Kong.
e The favourable effect of mortality and morbidity experience in 2014 of 23 million 2013: 33 million reflects better than expected experience in Indonesia and Hong Kong, offset by higher claims in Malaysia on medical reimbursement products.
f The positive persistency and withdrawals experience variance in 2014 of 44 million 2013: 36 million reflects favourable experience principally in Hong Kong across all product groups.
g The expense experience variance at 2014 is negative 27 million 2013: negative 17 million.
The variance arises in operations which are currently sub-scale China, Malaysia Takaful and Taiwan, and from short-term overruns in India and Korea.
iii US operations 2014 m 2013 m note a Unwind of discount and other expected returns 382 395 Effect of changes in operating assumptions: note b Persistency 55 47 note c Other 31 29 86 76 Experience variances and other items: note d Spread experience variance 192 217 note e Amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses 56 58 note f Other 118 74 366 349 Total US operations 834 820 The 2014 EEV results of the Group are presented on a post-tax basis and, accordingly, the 2013 results are shown on a comparable basis see note 1.
Notes a The decrease in unwind of discount and other expected returns of 13 million from 395 million for 2013 to 382 million for 2014 reflects a 73 million adverse effect of the 90 basis points reduction in the US 10-year treasury rate and a 19 million adverse foreign currency effect, partially offset by a 79 million effect mainly for the underlying growth in the in-force book.
b The credit in 2014 of 55 million 2013: 47 million for persistency assumption changes principally relates to revised assumptions for variable annuity business to more closely reflect recent experience.
c The effect of other changes in operating assumptions of 31 million reflects a number of offsetting items and includes the capitalised effect of changes in projected policyholder variable annuity fees of 46 million 2013: 33 million which vary depending on the size and mix of variable annuity funds.
d The spread assumption for Jackson is determined on a longer-term basis, net of provision for defaults see note 17 ii.
The spread experience variance in 2014 of 192 million 2013: 217 million includes the positive effect of transactions undertaken to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration.
e The amortisation of interest-related gains and losses reflects the fact that when bonds that are neither impaired nor deteriorating are sold and reinvested, there will be a consequent change in the investment yield.
The realised gain or loss is amortised into the result over the year when the bonds would have otherwise matured to better reflect the long-term returns included in operating profits.
f The effect of 118 million in 2014 for other experience variances and other items includes the effect of favourable persistency, mortality and tax experience variances, the most significant item arising from the continued positive persistency experience for annuity business of 59 million 2013: 40 million.
iv UK insurance operations 2014 m 2013 m note a Unwind of discount and other expected returns 410 437 note b Effect of change in UK corporate tax rate 98 note c Other items 66 60 Total UK insurance operations 476 595 The 2014 EEV results of the Group are presented on a post-tax basis and, accordingly, the 2013 results are shown on a comparable basis see note 1.
Notes a The decrease in unwind of discount and other expected returns of 27 million from 437 million for 2013 to 410 million for 2014 reflects a 59 million adverse impact of the 130 basis point reduction in gilt yields partially offset by 32 million mainly for the underlying growth in the in-force book.
b For 2013, the positive contribution from the change in UK corporate tax rates of 98 million reflected the combined effect of the reductions in corporate rates from 23 per cent to 21 per cent from April 2014 and 21 per cent to 20 per cent from April 2015. c Other items of 66 million for 2014 2013: 60 million principally reflect the positive effects of rebalancing the investment portfolio backing annuity business see note 16 b ii.
