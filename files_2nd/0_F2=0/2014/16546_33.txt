Source of information In respect of all businesses, the information has been certified by in house geologist on behalf of Group management.
Basis of preparation Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, other than those relating to Konkola Copper Mines plc KCM which complies with the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources the SAMREC Code.
The former code is prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and Minerals Council of Australia, and is commonly referred to as the JORC Code.
As at the date of this document, the editions of the JORC and SAMREC Codes in force are dated December 2004 and March 2000, respectively.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes recognise a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
The terms and definitions in the SAMREC Code are consistent with those used in the JORC Code with minor differences in terminology the JORC Code uses the term Ore Reserve whilst the SAMREC Code uses the term Mineral Reserve.
For the purposes of ore and mineral resources reported herein, the term ore resources have been used throughout.
Oil & gas reserves and resources have been prepared according to the Petroleum Resources Management Systems PRMS approved in March 2007 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the world Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologist, and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and or grade continuity.
The reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation.
An ore or mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource.
It includes the effect of dilution and losses which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, need to have been carried out and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified.
Ore reserves are sub-divided in order of decreasing confidence into proved ore reserves and probable ore reserves.
The measured and indicated mineral resources have been reported as being inclusive of those mineral resources modified to produce the ore reserves, in addition to the ore reserves.
The resource and reserve estimates provided herein comply with the resource and reserve definitions of the JORC Code, other than those relating to KCM which comply with the SAMREC Code.
