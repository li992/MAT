The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before amortisation of acquired intangibles, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring costs, other one-off items, profits and losses arising on the sale of businesses and associated impairment charges, trading profits and losses associated with disposed businesses, unwinding of provision discounting and net fair value losses on derivative financial instruments of 98.1m is 28.1% 2013: 29.6%, which comprises a tax charge of 27.3% 2013: 29.1% in respect of current year profits and a tax charge of 0.8% 2013: 0.5% in respect of prior years.
A deferred tax asset of 14.9m was recognised in the year in respect of previously unrecognised UK excess non-trading losses incurred in 2008 see Note 23 for details.
The following factors will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium Netherlands corporate tax rates greater than 20% and Ireland Poland corporate tax rates less than 20%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: the agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with a corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 23.

a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme The Company operates a SAYE scheme within the Republic of Ireland which is open to all employees and is linked to a monthly savings contract over a five year period.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at a percentage of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK since 2005.
Instead, the Company has operated a Share Incentive Plan SIP since 2005 as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting see page 116. www.

Awards have also been made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors best estimate for the effects of behavioural considerations.
c Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is offered to UK employees.
The SIP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of 20 each month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2014, 72,238 2013: 37,650 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.
Included within plant and machinery additions in 2014 were assets in the course of construction of 1.8m 2013: nil.
The impairment charges in the year relate to freehold land which the Group intends to sell.
The impairment reflects the expected sales proceeds, less the costs of environmental remediation for the site necessary before a sale can be completed.

DIVESTMENTS The Group has divested of three businesses in the year which in combination reported sales in 2014 of 31.0m 2013: 180.1m and made an operating loss of 6.7m 2013: 1.8m.
German Roofing As disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, at 31 December 2013 the Board had resolved to dispose of the Groups German Roofing operations, and because a loss was anticipated the net assets of the business were impaired to reflect the estimated net proceeds.
The disposal was completed on 28 February 2014 and, in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates the cumulative exchange differences on the retranslation of the net assets and goodwill and intangibles of the business a credit of 6.7m were reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group has incurred a further 1.7m of costs relating to the sale in the year ended 31 December 2014, resulting in a profit on disposal within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement of 5.0m.
Miller Pattison Limited On 24 April 2014 the Group sold Miller Pattison Limited, formerly known as SIG Energy Management Limited, for a consideration of 1.5m deferred until 31 December 2016, resulting in a loss on disposal of 12.9m.

GOODWILL CONTINUED Impairment review process The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs to reflect the operational gearing of the Group.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
In respect of the other assumptions, external data and managements best estimates are applied.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-3% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 3% in perpetuity.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates and range between 9% and 11%.
2014 impairment review results At 30 June 2014 the 3.3m goodwill held in respect of Ice Energy Technologies Limited was impaired in full due to the uncertainty surrounding the Governments Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.
On 13 October 2014 the Group disposed of its 50.6% shareholding in the company.
The carrying value of the Groups other CGUs remain supportable.
Sensitivity analysis A number of sensitivities have been performed on the Groups significant CGUs to highlight the changes in market conditions that would lead to verge of impairment.
The results are as follows: 2014 Long-term operating profit Like-for-like market volume growth rate average % per average % per annum Discount rate % annum CGU Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 678.7m 0.7 20.2 9.2 30.4 3.0 21.2 UK Exteriors 565.1m 0.9 25.9 9.2 24.8 3.0 17.6 Larivire 90.3m 0.4 9.3 11.0 2.9 2.2 1.6 2013 Long-term operating profit Like-for-like market volume growth rate average % per average % per annum Discount rate % annum CGU Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 525.3m 0.8 19.5 10.6 27.6 3.0 20.2 UK Exteriors 313.5m 0.9 19.6 10.6 19.4 3.0 14.6 Larivire 26.9m 0.1 1.8 12.4 1.0 2.2 0.1 The sensitivities noted above are the amounts by which the related assumption would have to vary before an impairment is indicated.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in revenue has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, no impairments would arise.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS The intangible assets presented below relate to acquired intangibles that arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill and computer software separable from any associated hardware.

ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, acquisition expenses of 1.0m in relation to the above acquisitions have been recognised within the Consolidated Income Statement and have been presented within Other items.
In addition, it is currently expected that, dependent upon future profits, a further 18.0m will be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who are employed by the Group.
These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business, and as required by IFRS 3, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the income statement as earned.
The related accrual of potential consideration in the period to 31 December 2014 is 2.9m 31 December 2013: 0.6m.
Added to the 1.0m acquisition expenses, this has led to a charge within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement of 3.9m in respect of acquisitions see Note 2.
Further to this, 11.8m of contingent consideration not subject to the vendors remaining within the business has been recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2015.
These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to: a the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value: b the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and c an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Groups policies.
The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of 5.4m and a gross contractual value of 5.5m.
The best estimate at the date of acquisition of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is 0.1m.
Included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
The goodwill of 18.6m arising from the acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 for all 2014 acquisitions amounted to 20.7m and 1.0m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2014 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2014 to the acquisition dates was 25.0m and 1.0m respectively.
Post balance sheet events On 30 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Advanced Cladding & Insulation Group Limited, a distributor of roofing materials and associated products in the United Kingdom for an initial consideration of 2.5m, with net assets acquired of 1.1m.
On 7 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Gutters & Ladders 1968 Limited, a distributor of roofline materials and associated products in the United Kingdom for an initial consideration of 3.5m, with net assets acquired of 1.7m.

No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 20.7m at 31 December 2014 2013: 27.7m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 130.5m 2013: 125.0m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 31 days overdue 2013: 33 days.
Ageing analysis of trade receivables for which no provision for impairment has been made 2014 2013 m m Neither past due nor renegotiated 220.3 231.2 Renegotiated 0.3 0.2 Balances overdue which have no provision for impairment: 1-30 days 87.1 79.8 31-60 days 29.8 28.8 61-90 days 8.6 10.0 91-120 days 1.7 2.9 121-180 days 1.4 1.8 180 days 1.9 1.7 130.5 125.0 Total trade receivables for which no provision for impairment has been made 351.1 356.4 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 27.7 29.3 Utilised 11.4 10.1 Disposals 0.1 Reclassified as held for sale 1.3 Added on acquisition 0.1 Charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 6.9 9.1 Exchange differences 2.5 0.7 At 31 December 20.7 27.7 In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 31.7m 2013: 40.3m and a provision for impairment of 20.7m 2013: 27.7m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

The derivative financial instruments are guaranteed by certain companies of the Group.
All of the above finance lease contracts are secured on the underlying assets.
The remaining balances are unsecured.
The bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and attract floating rates of interest, which at 31 December 2014 ranged from 0.4% to 3.0% 2013: between 0.5% and 4.0%.
Included within overdrafts are prepaid arrangement fees of 2.3m 2013: 1.0m.
0.4m 2013: 0.2m of the bank loans and loan notes due within one year after taking into account derivative financial instruments are at variable rates of interest.

The average credit period taken for trade purchases for continuing operations on a constant currency basis is 36 days 2013: 37 days.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payments are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of current liabilities approximates to their fair value.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Treasury Risk Management section of the Strategic Report on pages 33 to 35 includes a review of all treasury, liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in managing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Strategic Report on page 32.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, other financial assets, deferred consideration, cash and cash equivalents, and derivative financial instruments.
The following financial assets form part of the net debt of the Group: 2014 2013 m m Cash and cash equivalents including cash deposits repayable on demand 110.3 118.7 Other financial assets 0.9 Deferred consideration 1.5 Derivative financial instruments 33.9 29.7 Total 146.6 148.4 The Directors consider the fair value of financial assets to approximate to their book value.
The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of up to 2.0% 2013: 4.0%.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Of the above cash at bank, 15.9m 2013: 36.2m is denominated in Sterling, 78.1m 2013: 69.3m in Euros, 14.1m 2013: 11.5m in Polish Zloty, and 2.2m 2013: 1.7m in other currencies.
Of the other financial assets, 0.7m 2013: nil is denominated in Sterling, and 0.2m 2013: nil in Euros.
The deferred consideration is denominated in Sterling.
2014 interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2014, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments including derivative assets of 33.9m as noted above was as follows: Weighted Effective average fixed time for Floating Fixed interest which Amount Amount Total rate rate rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % Years m m Private placement notes Sterling 143.1 80.0 63.1 5.2 2.1 143.1 Other borrowings Sterling 2.4 0.1 2.3 0.4 0.5 2.4 Finance lease contracts Sterling 0.2 0.2 7.8 1.4 0.2 Private placement notes Euro 77.9 77.9 4.0 7.5 77.9 Other borrowings Euro 5.1 5.1 n a n a 1.0 4.1 Finance lease contracts Euro 8.0 8.0 6.6 4.9 8.0 Other borrowings Polish Zloty 0.2 0.2 n a n a 0.2 Finance lease contracts Polish Zloty 2.3 2.3 4.3 4.4 2.3 Other borrowings US Dollar 0.4 0.4 3.0 0.1 0.4 Total 239.6 85.4 154.2 12.1 227.5 In addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into a short-term currency derivative financial instrument which alters the currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities.
A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of 48.3m and a liability of 62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2014 at market rates and therefore the fair value is deemed to equate to its book value of nil.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2014 was 126.9m, of which 61.0m is denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling 10.5m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes approximates to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 13.2m and relates to finance lease contracts, fixed rate loans and loan notes.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 2013 interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2013, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments including derivative assets of 29.7m as noted on the previous page, was as follows: Weighted Effective average fixed time for Floating Fixed interest which Amount Amount Total rate rate rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % Years m m Private placement notes Sterling 141.5 37.8 103.7 4.2 3.7 141.5 Other borrowings Sterling 0.1 0.1 n a 0.2 0.1 Finance lease contracts Sterling 0.2 0.2 7.0 2.2 0.2 Private placement notes Euro 83.3 83.3 4.0 8.5 83.3 Other borrowings Euro 5.0 5.0 n a n a 0.5 4.5 Finance lease contracts Euro 7.7 7.7 7.4 4.1 7.7 Other borrowings Polish Zloty 0.2 0.2 n a n a 0.2 Finance lease contracts Polish Zloty 1.9 1.9 7.4 3.9 1.9 Total 239.9 43.0 196.9 10.5 229.4 In addition to the currency exposures above, the Group entered into a short-term currency derivative financial instrument which altered the currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities.
A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of 51.7m and a liability of 62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2013 at market rates and therefore the fair value was deemed to equate to its book value of nil.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2013 was 121.2m, of which 78.4m was denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling 9.8m, were secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors considered the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book values shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes approximated to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounted to 9.9m and related to finance lease contracts and fixed rate loans.
The Directors considered the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to materially approximate to the book values shown above.
In both 2014 and 2013, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
Hedging relationships Included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 33.9m 2013: 29.7m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 477.4m 2013: 500.7m.
Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 1.1m 2013: 2.1m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 573.6m 2013: 568.2m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Fair value measurement The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2. a Net investment hedges As at 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2013: one cross-currency forward contract which swaps Sterling denominated debt into Euro denominated debt.
This derivative financial instrument is a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets.
This derivative financial instrument was designated and effective as a net investment hedge and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2014 2013 Hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets m m Liability at 1 January 5.8 Fair value losses recognised in equity 1.4 Maturity of net investment hedges 7.2 Liability at 31 December b Cash flow hedges With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement within finance costs in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2013: two cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2013: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2014, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 1.8 years 2013: 2.8 years.

This interest rate derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2014, the maturity date of this swap is 3.6 years 2013: weighted average maturity date 4.6 years.

MATURITY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities inclusive of derivative financial assets at 31 December 2014 was as follows: 2014 2013 m m In one year or less 9.9 7.8 In more than one year but not more than two years 2.4 2.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 148.5 145.8 In more than five years 78.8 84.3 Total 239.6 239.9 The table above excludes trade payables of 206.3m 2013: 212.6m.
Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2014 as follows: 2014 2013 m m Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 250.0 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 250.0 Total 250.0 250.0 On 1 October 2014 the Group refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had 478m of committed facilities, of which 250m were undrawn as disclosed above.
Since 31 December 2014, a maximum of 50m has been drawn down against these facilities.
Contractual maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments, other financial assets, deferred consideration and cash and cash equivalents IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the maturity of the Groups remaining contractual financial liabilities.
The tables overleaf have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial assets and liabilities including interest that will accrue to those assets and liabilities except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay the liability before its maturity.
Both the inclusion of future interest and the values disclosed being undiscounted results in the total position being different to that included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Given that this is a maturity analysis all trade payables and receivables including amongst other items payroll and sales tax accruals which are not classified as financial instruments have been included.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a Interest rate sensitivity The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.
mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges: and iii.
floating rate Euro debt and Euro cash deposits.
b Foreign currency sensitivity The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars and Polish Zloty.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 29.
Leasehold dilapidations This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 29.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of completed acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
Other amounts Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and three years time.
Discounting of property provisions At 31 December 2014, existing onerous lease and leasehold dilapidation provisions were remeasured to the present value of the future cash flows required to settle the obligations.
This has resulted in a credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of 1.4m, of which 0.9m has been recognised in Operating Profit before Other items, and 0.5m has been recognised within Other items following the means by which the respective provisions were originally created.

During the year, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 14.9m net relating to c. 72m gross of previously unrecognised excess non-trading losses incurred in 2008 associated with the derivative financial instruments and included within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
In prior periods these non-trading losses were not recognised on the grounds of uncertainty, reflecting their nature.
Following utilisation in the current and prior periods the Directors now feel that the remaining amount is recoverable and therefore the asset has been recognised in full in the period.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 5m 2013: 8m that have not been recognised on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in Poland of 1m expire after four years and the tax losses in The Netherlands of 3m expire after eight years.
The remaining tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 18m 2013: 17m relating to undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, five 2013: five of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, one 2013: one has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and four 2013: four are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
In The Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SIGs share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Groups annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan increased to 112.2% as at 31 December 2014 2013: 107.5%.
As the coverage ratio improved, no change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2013: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
The Groups total pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest was 7.4m 2013: 8.6m, of which a charge of 1.9m 2013: 3.4m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 5.5m 2013: 5.2m related to defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In accordance with IAS 19, the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2013 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 131.4m and their actuarial value covered 90% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other four schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is re-insured by an external insurance company.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
Consolidated Income Statement charges The pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest of 0.6m 2013: 1.1m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 1.9m 2013: 3.4m.
In accordance with IAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2014 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes continued The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising, and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
Consolidated Balance Sheet liability The balance sheet position in respect of the five defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Pension liability before taxation 28.7 25.5 Related deferred tax asset 6.4 5.6 Pension liability after taxation 22.3 19.9 The actuarial loss of 7.7m 2013: gain of 8.3m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 1.7m 2013: charge of 2.0m and deferred tax charge of 0.1m 2013: 0.9m in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of corporation tax to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition, a deferred tax charge of 0.7m 2013: credit of 0.2m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
A full reconciliation of the deferred tax movement is shown in Note 23.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income amounted to a loss of 39.6m 2013: 31.9m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 19.4m 2013: 16.6m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 9.3m 2013: 8.9m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Pension liability at 1 January 25.5 34.4 Current service cost 1.3 2.3 Payment of unfunded benefits 2.4 Contributions 3.4 4.0 Net finance cost 0.6 1.1 Actuarial loss gain 7.7 8.3 Effect of changes in exchange rates 0.6 Pension liability at 31 December 28.7 25.5 Contributions of approximately 3.4m are expected to be paid to defined benefit pension schemes during the annual period beginning 1 January 2015.
The Group is contracted to pay 2.5m per annum to January 2019.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2014 2013 2012 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.5 2.5 2.5 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.6 2.5 2.5 Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 2.9 3.3 2.9 Discount rate 3.6 4.5 4.5 Inflation assumption 3.0 3.3 2.9 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes continued The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 27.4 years 2013: 28.1 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 60 of a male employee currently aged 40 years is 29.1 years 2013: 29.8 years.
If the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.25%, this would decrease increase the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 7.1m.
If the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.25% this would increase decrease the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 1.7m.
If the life expectancy for employees increased decreased by one year the Groups gross pension scheme deficit would increase decrease by 5.5m.
The average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2014 is 18 years 2013: 20 years.
