Other reserves reflect unrealised gains related to the transfer of investments between subsidiaries.
The profit and loss reserve of 843m 2013: 865m arose partly as a result of a provision of 214m against certain investments in subsidiaries in 2001 of which 156m was reversed in 2005.
The directors consider the value of the remaining investments in subsidiaries is considerably more than their book value.
Accordingly, the remaining provision of 58m does not impact the distributable reserves of Rexam PLC which were 862m at 31 December 2014 2013: 876m after deducting 39m 2013: 47m in respect of share options capitalised in cost of investment.
