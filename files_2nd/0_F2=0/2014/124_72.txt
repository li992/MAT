Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee Chairmans Statement On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year to 26 January 2014.
To reflect the requirements of the revised remuneration reporting regulations this report is presented in two sections: the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration policy.
It will be subject to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and every three years thereafter.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 26 January 2014 and how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be operated for the year commencing 27 January 2014.
This is subject to an advisory vote at the 2014 AGM.
2013 14 key decisions and pay outcomes The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay.
As described in the Strategic Report, the Group has continued to grow revenue and volume ahead of the U. K. soft drinks market, with revenue for the year to 26 January 2014 of 254.1m, an increase of 6.9% on the prior year.
Underlying pre-tax profit increased by 9.6% to 38.1m compared to the prior year.
Consequently an annual bonus of 57.8% of salary was paid to each of the executive directors in respect of the year to 26 January 2014.
Average EPS growth for the three years to 26 January 2014 exceeded the average EPS for the three years preceding that period both being adjusted for Retail Price Index by 15.1%.
As a result, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards granted in April 2011 vested at 38.2%.
Proposed changes in executive director remuneration for 2014 15 In line with the range of salary increases across the Group, an increase of 3.2% will be made to the executive directors base salaries with effect from 1 April 2014.
The latest LTIP the 2003 LTIP was approved by shareholders in May 2003, amended by resolution of the shareholders in May 2009 and expired in May 2013.
The Remuneration Committee took the opportunity to review the remuneration policy for the executive directors, including the LTIP.
As a result the Remuneration Committee is proposing to make a number of changes to the executive director remuneration framework for 2014 15.
These changes aim to improve the alignment of the remuneration framework with the interests of shareholders and our strategic sustainable growth agenda.
Key features are: An element of the annual bonus 20% of basic salary for the 2014 15 financial year will be assessed against strategic measures to better align our reward structure with key strategic priorities and to encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business.
At least 80% of the bonus will be assessed against key financial performance metrics of the business 80% of basic salary for the 2014 15 financial year.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the actual annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
They could provide our competitors with insight into our business plans, expectations and our strategic actions.
However, we will disclose how the bonus pay-out relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
For the avoidance of doubt, no changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity which will remain at 100% of salary.
Shareholder approval for a new LTIP the 2014 LTIP is being sought at the 2014 AGM.
The purpose of the 2014 LTIP is to drive and reward the achievement of longer-term objectives aligned closely to shareholders interests.
Awards granted under the 2003 LTIP have been subject to earnings per share EPS growth targets against RPI.
For awards granted under the 2014 LTIP in 2014 15 it is proposed that the awards will continue to be based on growth in EPS.
In future years the relevant metrics and the respective weightings may vary based upon the Companys strategic priorities.
However it is envisaged that no less than 50% of the award would be based on EPS growth.
The Remuneration Committee aims to use measures which provide a robust and transparent basis on which to measure the Companys performance and are aligned with the Companys business strategy.
Furthermore, the Remuneration Committee considers CPI to be a more relevant basis for measuring real EPS growth compared to RPI.
The actual performance measures and targets for 2014 LTIP awards to be granted in 2014 15 are set out on page 67.
The normal maximum annual award under the 2014 LTIP will be increased from 100% to 125% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a normal maximum annual award of 125% is appropriate given the level of stretch in the proposed targets.
