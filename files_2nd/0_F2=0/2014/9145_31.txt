Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the Leases discount on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
On initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

Remeasurements of the net defined pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculations result in a surplus to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect this presentation.
During the year the Group incurred costs of 8.1m on the acquisition of May Gurney 2013: 1.8m: following this acquisition the business incurred 29.6m of restructuring and transformation costs, primarily related to reduction in staff numbers and office rationalisation across the enlarged business.
Provision has been made for the likely 4.5m costs to satisfy the Groups share of both claims from, and administration costs of, The Construction Workers Compensation Scheme and related costs.
In 2013 the Group incurred restructuring costs in the Construction and Services divisions 10.1m, and provided for the loss on disposal of the tower crane business along with other discontinued businesses 3.2m and for the closure of the scaffolding and related businesses, 1.9m.

8 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below.
Kier Group Pension scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust separate from the assets of the Group.
The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service, although consultation with members to close the scheme to future accrual commenced in July 2014.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2013 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 822m which represented approximately 83% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in pensionable salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 16.4m 2013: 29.4m which included contributions of 8m 2013: 20.1m to fund the past service deficit.
The Group is currently consulting with members over the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual with effect from 1 November 2014.
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2013 valuation date.
The Group expects to make contributions for future service of 2.8m, being 21.8% of pensionable pay until 1 November 2014 assuming future accrual ends at that date, plus 16.7m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2015.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Kier Sheffield LLP participation in South Yorkshire Pension Fund The Group participated in the South Yorkshire Pension Fund through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP.
The participation commenced on 1 April 2003 when Kier Sheffield LLP became an admitted body.
As such it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme originally covered 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield City Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP at the start of the contract.
New employees were offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
The original contract terminated on 31 March 2014 and therefore Kier Sheffields participation in this defined benefit scheme ceased on that date.
The assets and liabilities relating to Kier Sheffield LLPs liabilities have been transferred back to Sheffield City Council.
Kier Sheffield LLPs pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The contributions paid during the nine month period to 31 March 2014 were 2.1m 2013: 1.8m.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2014 continued 8 Retirement benefit obligations continued Other defined benefit schemes The May Gurney and TransLinc defined benefit schemes were acquired with May Gurney see note 30.
Both of these defined benefit schemes have closed to future accrual and the sum of the deficit contributions to both plans payable in the period to 30 June 2014 amounted to 0.3m.
The trustees are responsible for decisions, holding the assets and delegate day to day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
Other defined contribution schemes Contributions are also made to a number of other defined contribution arrangements.
The Group paid contributions of 26.7m 2013: 13.7m during the year to these arrangements.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits disclosures Kier recognises any actuarial gains or losses through the statement of comprehensive income as permitted under IAS 19.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries were: Kier Group Pension Scheme 2014 2013 2012 % % % Rate of general increases in pensionable salaries 3.3 3.3 2.8 Rate of increase to pensions in payment liable for Limited Price Indexation 3.2 3.2 2.8 Discount rate 4.4 4.7 4.7 Inflation rate RPI 3.4 3.5 3.0 Inflation rate CPI 2.4 2.5 2.0 The mortality assumptions are that life expectancy from age 60 is currently 27.8 years for a man and 29.6 years for a woman but is expected to increase to 29.3 years for future male and 31.0 years for future female pensioners who retire in 2034.

This year, we have assumed that high quality corporate bonds are those which at least one rating agency considers to be at least AA or equivalent.
In previous years, we had required that the majority of the rating agencies rated a bond as AA for us to consider it a high quality corporate bond.
This represents a change in the basis of estimation applied in prior periods, and has had the impact of decreasing the defined benefit obligation in the Kier Group Pension Scheme by around 32m at 30 June 2014.

The Group has made the following special contributions to the Kier Group Pension Scheme: In July 2012, 5.0m which was settled in cash: and In June 2013, 7.1m which was settled through the transfer of the Groups interest in the Sydenham development site into Kier Sydenham LP, an equal partnership between the Group and the scheme.
These amounts have been included as contributions received by the scheme.
No special contributions were made in the year to 30 June 2014.
Pension sensitivity The following table shows the change in surplus deficit arising from a change in the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the retirement benefits obligations for the Kier Group Pension Scheme: 2014 2013 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year 0.25% 1 year -0.25% -1 year m m m m Discount rate 0.25%, -0.25% 41.1 41.4 36.5 36.5 Inflation rate 0.25%, -0.25% 20.3 20.3 22.0 22.0 Increase in life expectancy - 1 year 28.7 28.7 26.5 26.5 The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occuring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in a key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.

The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to reflect this presentation see note 4.
Kier Group and its subsidiaries are based predominantly in the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax.
Where Kier operates overseas, this will generally be either through UK resident companies or branches of UK companies, and therefore these companies will pay UK corporation tax subject to the offset of local overseas tax.
The Group does not have an aggressive tax policy and has not entered into any tax avoidance schemes which were, or should have been, notified to HMRC under the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes DOTAS rules during the year or previous year.
The tax charge before exceptional items and amortisation of contract rights of 13.9m 2013: 5.1m shown in the table above equates to an effective tax rate of 19% 2013: 11% on adjusted profit before tax of 73.2m 2013: 47.4m.
This effective rate is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 22.5% 2013: 23.75% due to a number of items shown in the table above.
The increase in non-deductible expenses relates mainly to acquisition costs on May Gurney and permanent differences on provisions.
The effect of the change in the UK corporation tax rate arises principally as a result of the impact of the rate change on the deferred tax asset related to the retirement benefit obligations.
In accordance with accounting standards the effect of the change in the tax rate on the deferred tax balance is recognised in the same primary statement that the original deferred balance was recognised.
The original deferred tax balance relating to the retirement benefit obligation is made up of two larger amounts that were previously recognised in part through Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 112 Strategic report Governance Financial statements the income statement and in part through the statement of comprehensive income.
This has resulted in a credit in the income statement and a charge in the statement of comprehensive income for the years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the tax deduction received in respect of the cost of shares exercised under the Groups employee Save As You Earn Scheme and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The adjustment in respect of prior years results from differences between the estimates of taxation included in the previous years financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.
b Recognised in the cash flow statement The cash flow statement shows a repayment of 11.3m during the year 2013: 3.5m.
9.4m relates to May Gurney which primarily is a result of losses on onerous contracts.
c Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 2014 2013 m m Deferred tax expense including effect of change in tax rate Share of fair value movements on joint venture cash flow hedging instruments 3.6 1.7 Fair value movements on cash flow hedging instruments 0.3 Actuarial losses on defined benefit pension schemes 4.9 1.2 Provisions 1.9 Total tax charge in the statement of comprehensive income 10.1 2.9 Restated on adoption of the amendment to IAS 19 see note 31. d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Chancellor has so far cut the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 21% since 2012, and announced it will reduce further by an additional 1% in April 2015, so it will reach 20%.
The corporation tax reduction from 23% to 21%, that became effective from 1 April 2014, and a further reduction to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, were both substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
The reduction to 20% has had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset by 1.1m, with 5.4m being credited to the income statement and 6.5m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
This will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax balance as at the year end has been recognised at 20%.
e Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of 14.8m 2013: 10.3m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 14.7m 2013: 10.2m of these losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
10 Dividends Amounts recognised as distributions to owners of the parent in the year: 2014 2013 m m Final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2013 of 46.5 pence 2012: 44.5 pence 25.0 17.3 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 June 2014 of 22.5 pence 2013: 21.5 pence 12.3 8.5 37.3 25.8 The proposed final dividend of 49.5 pence 2013: 46.5 pence, bringing the total dividend for the year to 72.0 pence 2013: 68.0 pence, had not been approved at the balance sheet date and so has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangibles has been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based on the Groups forecasts, approved by management, covering a three-year period.
The resulting cash flows are discounted to present value, with the discount rate used in the value in use calculations based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the assets being tested.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the forecast revenues and gross margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
Cash flows for periods beyond those forecast have a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Significant headroom exists in all segments and management considers that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not lead to an impairment being recognised.
Services segment A revenue growth rate of 2% and a fixed operating margin of 5% have been applied to the Services segment cash flows into perpetuity.
These assumptions are in line with current trading and current forecasts of UK GDP growth rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.1%.
Based on the value in use calculation, these assumptions derived a recoverable amount for the Services segment that is 531m above the carrying value of segmental assets.
The Services CGU impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions: discount rate, revenue growth rate and the operating margin, although management do not consider that any reasonable possible change in any single assumption would give rise to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
The assumptions would have to change as follows for any single assumption change to bring headroom down to nil: Discount rate increase from 9.1% to 18.1% Growth rate reduce from positive 2% to negative 7.7% Underlying operating margin reduce from 5% to 1.6% Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 116 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 13 Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and buildings equipment Mining Total m m m m Cost At 30 June 2012 51.5 87.0 44.4 182.9 Additions 8.8 12.7 5.5 27.0 Disposals 0.1 6.3 6.4 Transferred to assets held for sale 12.5 12.5 Currency realignment 0.2 0.2 At 30 June 2013 60.2 81.1 49.9 191.2 Acquired 7.3 158.8 166.1 Additions 6.7 39.5 2.0 48.2 Disposals 2.4 42.6 45.0 Currency realignment 1.2 1.2 At 30 June 2014 71.8 235.6 51.9 359.3 Accumulated depreciation At 30 June 2012 4.6 52.0 23.5 80.1 Charge for the year 1.5 8.1 3.1 12.7 Disposals 0.1 5.1 5.2 Transferred to assets held for sale 5.7 5.7 Currency realignment 0.1 0.1 At 30 June 2013 6.0 49.4 26.6 82.0 Acquired 3.2 75.8 79.0 Charge for the year 2.2 32.3 7.0 41.5 Disposals 1.1 35.6 36.7 Impairment 2.0 2.0 Currency realignment 0.9 0.9 At 30 June 2014 12.3 121.0 33.6 166.9 Net book value At 30 June 2014 59.5 114.6 18.3 192.4 At 30 June 2013 54.2 31.7 23.3 109.2 The net book value of plant and equipment includes an amount of 81.2m 2013: 13.7m in respect of assets held under finance leases see note 21.

Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards made under the scheme are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing and is subject to the Group achieving specific performance targets.
Awards under the LTIP are all equity settled.
The awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust and May Gurney Group Trustees Ltd ESOP Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on pages 67 to 85.
Value of share schemes The fair value per option granted has been calculated using the following assumptions.
These calculations are based on the Black-Scholes model for all options apart from the TSR element of the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The performance conditions of the EPS element are non-market conditions under IFRS 2.
The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
4.0m relating to share-based payments has been recognised in the income statement as employee costs 2013: 4.0m.

27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: to optimise the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital: and to maintain a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification.
The three operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property division requires net capital to fund developments.
The Groups capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and deliver the Groups capital management objectives.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2013.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described further below.
The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of borrowings.
All investment decisions are made with regard to the Groups weighted average cost of capital and typically a pre-tax annualised return of at least 15% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise any potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
The Groups most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the client.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual, receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
2014 2013 m m Provision as at 1 July 1.3 1.2 Acquired in the year 1.8 Charged credited to the income statement 0.8 0.1 Provision as at 30 June 2.3 1.3 There were 48.8m 2013: 13.2m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 37.8m 2013: 7.7m had been received by the end of August 2014.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2014 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2014 that were overdue for payment was 13.6% 2013: 5.7%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 36 days 2013: 46 days Services 41 days 2013: 34 days Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 125 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2014 continued 27 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term capital requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR.
The Groups borrowings can be analysed as follows: 2014 2013 m m Fixed rate 62.7 62.7 Variable rate 172.5 29.8 235.2 92.5 In addition, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a Group of relationship banks in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments Current Non-current Total liabilities liabilities liabilities At 30 June 2014 m m m Fuel price forward contracts 0.1 0.3 0.4 Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as derivatives held at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of these contracts has been determined based on a level 2 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
During 2013 Kier Group plc entered in to three cross-currency fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value USD28m.
These swaps have continued to meet the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cashflows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how those cashflows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments.
Expected cash flows More than Fair value Total 0-1 years 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years m m m m m m Interest rate swaps: Liabilities 1.7 6.7 0.9 0.9 2.7 2.2 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2014 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 111.4m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2014, based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to 11.8m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 2.7m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.

May Gurney provides support services and delivers a wide range of essential front-line services to the public and regulated sectors.
The acquisition represented an excellent opportunity to accelerate Kiers strategy for its Services division.
The Kier Board believes the acquisition is highly complementary and will provide an increased breadth of services, skills, geographic coverage and operating efficiencies, representing an attractive proposition for its clients and those of the enlarged Group and enhanced value for the shareholder base of the enlarged Group.
The fair value of the intangible assets acquired represents the fair value of customer contracts at the date of acquisition.
During the second half of the year we continued to review the fair value of the May Gurney net assets acquired and, subsequent to the issue of the interim results as at 31 December 2013, further adjustments were made, principally to provisions for contract losses, current tax asset and deferred tax liabilities.
The fair value of the assets acquired was estimated at 31 December 2013 at 30.4m and the amendments to 30 June 2014, which will not change, reduce the fair value of the net assets acquired to 27.6m.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the knowledge and expertise of the assembled workforce and the operating synergies that arise from the Groups strengthened market position.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
8.1m 2013: 1.8m of acquisition costs were incurred in the year and expensed to the income statement as an exceptional item.

The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the acquisition of May Gurney Integrated Services plc had been made at the beginning of the year, would include revenue from continuing operations of 2,999.9m compared to the Group revenue of 2,985.2m and underlying profit before taxation of 72.6m compared to the reported underlying profit before taxation of 73.1m.
In preparing the pro forma results, revenue and costs have been included as if the businesses were acquired on 1 July 2013 and the inter-company transactions have been eliminated.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchase actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
The May Gurney business contributed to the Group, revenue of 697m and underlying profit before taxation of 32.8m for the period 8 July 2013 to 30 June 2014.
Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 130 Strategic report Governance Financial statements c Deemed disposal of investment in joint venture and subsequent acquisition as a subsidiary of Justice Support Services Norfolk and Suffolk Holdings Limited On 4 April 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Justice Support Services Norfolk and Suffolk Holdings Limited JSS.
JSS had previously been held as a joint venture of which the Group had a 42.5% holding.
On 17 February 2014 the Group increased its holding in JSS from 42.5% to 57.5% at a cost of 0.7m.
JSS continued to be classified as a joint venture as joint control remained in place.
The remaining 42.5% of the share capital of JSS was acquired from the joint venture partner on 4 April 2014 for 4.0m.
This transaction has been treated as a deemed disposal of a joint venture see below and subsequent acquisition of a subsidiary.
A gain of 1.1m arose on the deemed disposal of the joint venture.
The gain on deemed disposal of the joint venture is calculated as follows: m Deemed consideration 5.4 Cost of investment 4.3 Gain on deemed disposal 1.1 Provisional fair values of assets and liabilities at acquisition: Provisional carrying value at acquisition m Non-current assets 65.6 Current assets 2.2 Cash at bank 4.8 Current liabilities 5.1 Borrowings 57.7 9.8 Negative goodwill 0.4 Total assets acquired 9.4 Satisfied by: Cash 4.0 Deemed consideration 5.4 Total consideration 9.4 Subsequent to the acquisition on 4 April 2014, but before 30 June, the Group decided to dispose of JSS within 12 months of the balance sheet date and negotiations are ongoing with a number of interested parties.
As a result at the balance sheet date JSS is held as an asset held for resale.
d Disposal of investments in joint ventures During the year the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Project Investment Limited, sold its investments in the following joint ventures: Justice Support Services North Kent Holdings Limited and Kent PFI Holdings Company 1 Limited.
The disposal proceeds can be reconciled to the profit on disposal as follows: 2014 2013 m m Sales proceeds 17.3 13.0 Book value of net assets and loans of joint ventures 9.4 3.1 Intangible assets sold 1.8 Sale costs 0.1 Profit on disposal 6.1 9.8 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 131 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2014 continued 30 Acquisitions and disposals continued e Sale of plant business On 5 August 2013, the Group through its subsidiary Kier Plant Limited, sold the remainder of its plant business tower cranes for a consideration of 5.2m.
The total impact of this disposal is a loss of 2.6m which was recorded in the income statement in the year to June 2013 as an exceptional item.
The disposal proceeds can be reconciled to the loss as follows: 2014 2013 m m Maximum aggregate consideration 5.2 14.5 Less provision for disposal costs 1.0 1.5 Fair value less provision for disposal costs 4.2 13.0 Carrying value of assets sold 6.8 16.2 Loss 2.6 3.2 The carrying value of the assets sold was originally held in property, plant and equipment.
The loss on disposal in 2013 was recorded in the income statement in the year to 30 June 2012 as an exceptional item.
Change of accounting policy The amendment to IAS 19 has changed the accounting for defined benefit schemes and termination benefits.
The interest cost and expected return on scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 have been replaced with a net interest cost which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation.
The amendment has a corresponding impact on the actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with no overall change to the net retirement benefit liability in the balance sheet.
The Group adopted the amendment to IAS 19 on 1 July 2013 and has restated prior year information, which had the following impact on reported profit, earnings per share and comprehensive income in 2013: Actuarial 2013 losses Deferred tax Total Statement of comprehensive income m m m As previously reported 24.2 2.9 21.3 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 17.1 4.1 13.0 Restated 7.1 1.2 8.3 Profit 2013 before Profit tax Taxation after tax Income statement m m m As previously reported 43.0 4.4 38.6 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 Operating profit 14.2 3.4 10.8 Finance costs 2.9 0.7 2.2 17.1 4.1 13.0 Restated 25.9 0.3 25.6 Earnings per share pence Basic Diluted Adjusted As previously reported 95.8 94.8 136.2 Impact of amendment to IAS 19 33.2 32.8 33.1 Impact of representation of acquisition discount unwind 2.5 Restated 62.6 62.0 105.6 Unwind of discount in respect of deferred consideration.
Subsequent events On 29 August 2014 the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Project Investment Limited, sold its 50% holding in Information Resources Oldham Holdings Limited for a total consideration of 2.4m.
The expected impact of this disposal is a profit of 1.2m before disposal costs.
