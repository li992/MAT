The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys objective and investment policy as set out on page 8, including that borrowings may be used to provide gearing of the equity portfolio up to the maximum authorised by shareholders, currently 200 million.
Net gearing was 15.7% 2013: 17.6% at the balance sheet date.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital were unchanged throughout the year and the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Strategic Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 10 to 13.
These also explain that the Company is able to use borrowings to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy-back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility by the terms imposed by the custodian.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Borrowings comprise the debenture stocks, details of which are contained in note 12 and an overdraft facility which may be used for short-term funding requirements.
Contingencies, Guarantees and Financial Commitments This note would show any liabilities the Company is committed to honour, but which are dependent on future circumstances or events occurring.
There are no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments of the Company at the year end 2013: nil.
