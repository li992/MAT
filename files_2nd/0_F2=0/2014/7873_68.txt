5 Reconciliation of effective tax rate As IMIs head office and parent company is domiciled in the UK, the Group references its effective tax rate to the UK corporation tax rate, despite only a small proportion of the Groups business being in the UK.
Therefore, the following tax reconciliation applies the UK corporation tax rate for the year to profit before tax, both before and after exceptional items.
This resulting tax charge is reconciled to the actual tax charge for the Group, by taking account of specific tax adjustments as follows: 2014 2013 Before Exceptional Before Exceptional exceptionals items Total exceptionals items Total m m m m m m Profit before tax from continuing operations 278.1 32.4 245.7 297.7 48.4 249.3 Profit before tax from discontinued operations section 2.5 - 481.0 481.0 80.4 8.0 72.4 Profit before tax 278.1 448.6 726.7 378.1 56.4 321.7 Income tax using the Companys domestic rate of tax of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% 59.8 96.4 156.2 87.9 13.1 74.8 Effects of: Non-deductible items 2.9 4.7 7.6 4.3 2.1 6.4 Exceptional tax charge on restructuring - - - - 17.1 17.1 Non-taxable profit on disposal of businesses - 108.0 108.0 - - - Utilisation of tax losses - - - 1.4 - 1.4 Current year losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 1.3 - 1.3 1.3 - 1.3 Differing tax rates 0.8 1.7 0.9 0.1 2.1 2.2 Over under provided in prior years 3.6 2.8 0.8 1.3 - 1.3 Total tax in income statement section 2.4 61.2 5.8 55.4 90.7 4.0 94.7 Income tax expense reported in the consolidated income statement 61.2 8.3 52.9 65.5 9.8 55.7 Effective rate of tax: 22.0% 21.5% 22.0% 22.3% Income tax attributable to discontinued operations section 2.5 - 2.5 2.5 25.2 13.8 39.0 Effective rate of tax: 0.5% 31.3% 53.9% Total tax in income statement section 2.4 61.2 5.8 55.4 90.7 4.0 94.7 Effective rate of tax: 22.0% 7.6% 24.0% 29.4% 2.4.

8 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets of 39.8m 2013: 29.0m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 16.1m 2013: 12.4m, interest of 40.4m 2013: 30.6m and capital losses of 113.3m 2013: 83.2m.
The majority of the tax losses have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these temporary differences due to uncertainty over their offset against future taxable profits and therefore their recoverability.
It is likely that the majority of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption.
However 81.7m 2013: 78.0m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 8.1m 2013: 7.9m, of which only 2.0m 2013: 1.5m has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
