Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements and the groups exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the BT Group plc Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these policies to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director of the BT Group plc Board.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2014 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy The groups interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings.
Interest cash ow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rate, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at xed rates.
The groups policy, as set by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority from the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate prole, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.

Sensitivity analysis The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies The impact on the groups annual net finance expense of a 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease of 207m 2012 13: 193m.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2014 2013 m m Increase Increase At 31 March Reduce Reduce Sterling interest rates 337 418 US Dollar interest rates 361 420 Euro interest rates 14 36 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignicant in both 2013 14 and 2012 13. Credit ratings The groups 2016 and 2030 bonds contain covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.3bn at 31 March 2014, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups 600m 2014 bond attracts an additional 1.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating below Baa3 BBB by either or both Moodys and S&P, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of approximately 6m per year.
BT Group plcs credit ratings were as detailed below: 2014 2013 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Stable BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Positive Baa2 Positive BT Group plc is targeting a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 87 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The maturity prole of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2014 is disclosed in note 22.
The group has term debt maturities of 1.2bn in 2014 15.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
During 2013 14 and 2012 13 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2014 the group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2012 13: 1.5bn maturing in March 2016.
Maturity analysis The following table provides an analysis of the remaining contractually agreed cash ows including interest payable for the groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value.

Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the BT Group plc Boards dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and S&P and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
Action is taken where appropriate and cost effective, if counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Operational management policy The BT Group plc Boards credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, the group may endeavour to minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2014 2013 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 653 1,250 Investments 20 21,398 20,338 a Trade and other receivables 15 2,189 2,235 Cash and cash equivalents 21 690 919 24,930 24,742 a The carrying amount excludes 214m 2012 13: 184m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 722m 2012 13: 699m of prepayments and other receivables.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.

The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 15, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty, or group of related counterparties the group has entered into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group has also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby on a weekly and monthly basis the fair value position on notional 945m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash outow during the year was 209m 2012 13: cash inow of 33m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within cash and cash equivalents, and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

At 31 March 2014 the amount deferred which is not yet recognised in the income statement is 14m.
With the exception of this contract which is included at Level 3, and valued using assumptions on volumes, ination, and market energy prices, all other derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as dened in note 20.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash ow hedges Instruments designated in a cash ow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to our 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash ows will affect profit or loss as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings.
See note 22 Loans and other borrowings.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar and Asia Pacic currencies and purchases of US Dollar denominated retail devices are hedged 12 months forward on a one month rolling basis.
The related cash ows will be recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash ow hedges were fully effective in the period.
See note 25 for details of the movements in the cash ow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 23.
Other derivatives BT Group plcs policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classied as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
