Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2014 88 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Available for sale financial assets 2014 2013 Group m m At 1 January 215.4 202.9 Additions 2.5 14.7 Settlements 30.3 12.9 Gains Finance income 13.7 10.7 At 31 December 201.3 215.4 There have been no gains losses recognised in other comprehensive income other than those recognised through finance income in profit and loss.
Of the gains recognised in finance income for the period 8.1m 2013: 8.9m was unrealised.
Available for sale financial assets, also known as shared equity receivables, comprise loans, largely with a ten year term and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
Loans are repayable at the borrowers option on sale or transfer of the related property or other redemption of the first legal charge or at the end of the fixed term.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the Directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The Directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each financial reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which the Directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 December 2014 2013: nil.
None of the financial assets are past their due dates 2013: nil and the Directors expect an average maturity profile of between 5 and 10 years from the balance sheet date.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 22.
18 Inventories 2014 2013 m m Land 1,842.4 1,636.6 Work in progress 464.7 463.5 Part exchange properties 52.4 45.5 Showhouses 48.7 49.3 2,408.2 2,194.9 The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion ofinventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues, including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
As set out in note 6, the Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during 2014.
This review did not give rise to an exceptional credit or debit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 2013: 14.1m credit.
A reversal of 9.9m 2013: 22.0m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period and an impairment of land and work in progress of 9.9m 2013: 7.9m were recognised in the year.
This reversal charge arose due to forecast selling prices and development costs on individual sites being higher or lower than previously estimated by management as a result of changing conditions, and or development plans.
Our approach to our net realisable value review has been consistent with that conducted at 31 December 2013.
Net realisable provisions held against inventories at 31 December 2014 were 80.4m 2013: 102.8m.
The key judgements in estimating the future net present realisable value of a site were the estimation of likely sales prices, house types and costs to complete the developments.
Sales prices and costs to complete were estimated on a site by site basis based upon existing market conditions.
If the UK housing market were to improve or deteriorate in the future then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
