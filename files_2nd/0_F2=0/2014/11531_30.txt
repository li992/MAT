Its registered offices are located at 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.
Ophir Energys business is the development of offshore and deepwater oil and gas exploration assets.
The Company has an extensive and diverse portfolio of exploration interests across Africa and Asia.
The Companys financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 March 2015 and the Statement of Financial Position was signed on the Boards behalf by Nicholas Smith and Nick Cooper.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for revaluation of certain derivative instruments measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in US Dollars rounded to the nearest thousand dollars $000 except as otherwise indicated.
Comparative figures for the period to 31 December 2013 are for the year ended on that date.
New and Amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations The Company has adopted relevant new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2014.
These are detailed in note 2 of the Group financial statements.
2.2 Significant accounting policies a Investment in subsidiaries The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries of which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Such balances are considered to be part of the Companys net investment in its subsidiaries.
The carrying values of investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, but excludes any restricted cash.
Restricted cash is not available for use by the Company and therefore is not considered highly liquid for example cash set aside to cover rehabilitation obligations.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Allowance is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full.
Evidence on non-recoverability may include indications that the debtor or group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or default or delinquency in repayments.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.
They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obligated to make future payments in respect of the purchase of those goods and services.
The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
136 Ophir Energy plc Governance Financial Supplementary Strategic report report statements information Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements iv.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest ratemethod.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Afinancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
c Inventories Inventories which comprise drilling consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by using weighted average cost method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of transportation and other related expenses.
d Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, which comprises furniture and fittings and computer equipment, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating asintended.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment calculated using the straight line method at rates to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the statement of financial position date, of each asset over expected useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years.
e Provisions A provision is recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
f Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Company does not operate its own pension plan but makes pension or superannuation contributions to private funds of its employees which are defined contribution plans.
The cost of providing such benefits are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
g Employee benefits Salaries, wages, annual leave and sick leave Liabilities for salaries and wages, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect of employees services up to the reporting date.
They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
h Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
i Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
The Company has leases where the Lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
Such leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
j Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 137 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued k Interest income Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest rate method, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
l Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined with reference to the market value of the underlying shares using a pricing model appropriate to the circumstances which requires judgements as to the selection of both the valuation model and inputs.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition or a non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each statement of financial position date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated on the basis of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous statement of financial position date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties, the goods or services received are measured at the date of receipt by reference to their fair value with a corresponding entry in equity.
If the Company cannot reliably estimate the fair value of the goods or services received, their value is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
m Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is determined on an individual basis according to the primary economic environment in which itoperates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
All exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate ruling as at the date of the initial transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at a revalued amount in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate ruling at the date when the fair value was determined.
138 Ophir Energy plc Governance Financial Supplementary Strategic report report statements information Consolidated financial statements Company financial statements n Income taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Current income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement.
o Impairment The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an intangible asset or item of property plant & equipment may be impaired.
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for is required, the Company estimates the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available.
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Companys CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for a property previously revalued and the revaluation was taken to other comprehensive income.
In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 139 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 2.3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on managements experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.
The Company has used estimates and assumptions in deriving certain figures within the financial statements.
Such accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time.
The key areas of estimation are detailed in note 2.4 of the Group financial statements.
3 Loss attributable to members of the parent company The loss attributable to the members of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014 is $219.0 million 2013: $132.7 million.
4 Share-based compensation a Employee incentive share option plans Ophir Energy Company Foundation Incentive Scheme On 12 May 2004 the Ophir Energy Company Foundation Incentive Scheme was established shortly after the formation of the Company to attract new employees on start up.
The plan provided for a total of 1,450,000 options to acquire ordinary shares at 1p per share to be issued to eligible employees.
The Scheme was terminated on 24 November 2005 and all options issued under the scheme have fully vested.
Ophir Energy Company 2006 Share Option Plan On 5 April 2006 the Board resolved to establish the Ophir Energy Company Limited 2006 Share Option Plan.
Any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or any Director of the Company or any subsidiary who is required to devote substantially the whole of his working time to his duties is eligible to participate under the Plan.
At the grant date the Board of Directors determine the vesting terms, if any, subject to the proviso that no more than one half of the options become exercisable on the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant and any performance conditions are satisfied.
Options have an exercise period of 10 years from the date of grant.
Ophir Energy Long Term Incentive Share Option Plan On 26 May 2011 the Board resolved to establish the Ophir Energy Long Term Incentive Share Option Plan.
This was introduced to give awards to Directors and senior management subject to outperforming a comparator group of similarly focused oil and gas exploration companies in terms of shareholder return over a three year period.
The Plan awards a number of shares to Directors and senior management based on a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three year period and the full award is made only if Ophir has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies.
Ophir Energy plc 2012 Deferred Share Plan On 19th June 2012 the Board resolved to establish the Ophir Energy plc Deferred Share Plan 2012 DSP.
The plan was introduced to provide executive management with a means of retaining and incentivising employees.
The structure of the DSP will enable a portion of participants annual bonuses to be deferred into options to acquire ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
All options issued to date vest after a three year period.
The DSP operates in conjunction with the Ophir Energy plc Employee Benefit Trust.
The Trust will hold ordinary shares in the Company for the benefit of its employees and former employees, which may then be used, on a discretionary basis, to settle the DSP Awards as and when they are exercised.
No shares have been acquired by the Trust.

Interim hearings in relation to security for costs applications were scheduled to be heard on 12 February and 23 February 2015 but were deferred to another date to be determined.

23 Events after reporting period On 3 March 2015 the acquisition date, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Salamander Energy Plc Salamander, a South East Asian focused independent exploration and production company quoted on the LSE.
The Group announced that the scheme of arrangement was approved by Salamanders shareholders on 6 February 2015 and was sanctioned by the Supreme Court in London effective on 2 March 2015.
The transaction has therefore closed and the entire issued ordinary share capital of Salamander is now owned by Ophir.
The consideration of $326.1 million was satisfied in full by equity by which Salamander shareholders received 0.5719 Ophir ordinary shares for each Salamander ordinary share held.
The enlarged Group enhances Ophirs operating capabilities in both Africa and South East Asia and deepwater expertise across key technical and commercial functions.
The combined Group provides shareholders with a diversified exposure to 21 production, development and exploration blocks in Africa and South East Asia.
The acquisition will be accounted for as a single business combination.
The fair value assessment of the Salamander identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of acquisition have been reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Details of the Group accounting policies in relation to business combinations are contained in note 2.3 c. The fair values of the assets acquired have been calculated using valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows using forward curve commodity prices, a discount rate based on market observable data and cost and production profiles.

The fair value of the shares is the published price of the shares of the Group at the acquisition date.
Therefore, the fair value of the share consideration given is $326.1 million.
The goodwill balance is the result of the requirement to recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities, as specified in IFRS 3 and IAS 12 and is calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and their tax bases.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to $25.0 million.
The gross amount of trade receivables is $25.0 million.
However, none of the trade receivables have been impaired and it is expected that the full amounts can be collected.
The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the timing and complexity of the acquisition.
The Group is continuing to refine the fair value of assets and liabilities identified as part of the acquisition.
The review of the fair value of the assets and the liabilities acquired will continue for 12 months from the acquisition date at the latest.
