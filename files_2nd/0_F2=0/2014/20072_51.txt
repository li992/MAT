Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PLATINUM GROUP METALS estimates as at 31 December 2014 ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in compliance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
Operations and Projects outside South Africa were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
Details of the individual operations appear in Anglo American Platinums Annual Report.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable cut appropriate to the specific reef.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
Reserve Life is reported from 2014 onwards and is aligned with the current approved Life of Mine Plan.
Anglo American plcs ownership of Anglo American Platinum Limited is 78%.
4E PGE is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
Concentrator recoveries for Merensky Reef UG range from 86% to 89%, UG2 Reef UG from 78% to 87%, Platreef from 75% to 85% and Main Sulphide Zone from 70% to 78%.
Tailings reprocessing recoveries range from 30% to 40%.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2015 Business plan.
The pay limit is based on Cost 4 which consists of Direct Cash Cost on and off mine, Other Indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The Ore Reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 2.1g t and 5.3g t 4E PGE.
The range is a function of various factors including depth of the orebody, geological complexity, mining method, infrastructure and economic parameters.
Merensky Reef: The global Ore Reserve 4E ounce content and tonnage increased due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves mainly at Bokoni, BRPM and Thembelani mines.
These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Ore Reserves mainly from Tumela Mine where Ore Reserves have been reallocated to Mineral Resources.
UG2 Reef: The primary contribution to the overall decrease is production.
Additionally the global Ore Reserve 4E content decreased but the tonnage increased largely due to the reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources mainly at Dishaba, Tumela and Modikwa mines.
Adjusted modifying factors applied to AAPL managed mines resulted in a tonnage increase and a grade decrease.
These decreases were partially offset by the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves mainly at Siphumelele 3 managed by Aquarius Platinum Ltd, Mototolo and Thembelani mines.
Platreef: The pay limit is 2.3 g t 4E for the mining operations and varies between 1.0g t and 1.7 g t 4E for the stockpiles.
The Ore Reserves 4E content and tonnage decreased as a result of a change in the detailed ramp designs associated with Cut 18 during planning optimisation which resulted in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources.
The change in the design only affects the southern portion of the Mogalakwena pit.
The anticipated Life of Mine Plan exceeds the current Mining Right expiry date.
Platreef Primary stockpile: Mined ore retained for future treatment and reported separately as Proved Reserves but included in the Total Platreef Ore Reserves.
All Reefs Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2014 is: Total: 2,274.0 Mton 2013: 2,331.7 Mton at 0.088 oz ton 2013: 0.089 oz ton.
Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not reported as part of the published Ore Reserves.
At Rustenburg mines dormant dams have been evaluated and are separately reported as Probable Ore Reserves.
The treatment of tailings is sensitive to both price and volume therefore resulting in tailings dam material being reported as Probable Reserves only.
Main Sulphide Zone: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E content decreased mainly due to changes in the modifying factors as well as production.
Anglo American Platinum Limited currently reports an effective 100% interest in Unki Mine, subject to the finalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
Main Sulphide Zone Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2014 is: Total: 54.5 Mton 2013: 55.8 Mton at 0.103 oz ton 2013: 0.108 oz ton.

Tonnes are quoted as dry metric tonnes.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
Merensky Reef: The Mineral Resource 4E content decreased but the tonnage increased mainly due to an improved resource evaluation methodology applied to the Tumela Pothole Reef facies, partially offset by the Mineral Resources content and tonnage increase at Union, Rustenburg and Dishaba mines due to lower geological losses applied.
UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resource 4E content and tonnage increased mainly at Union, Dishaba and Bokoni mines due to lower geological losses applied.
A decrease of Mineral Resources occurred due to the disposal of Driekop, a reconciliation adjustment at Kroondal and Marikana and conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at Mototolo.
Platreef: A 1.0g t 4E cut-off is used to define Platreef Mineral Resources.
The Mineral Resources increased due to reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources mainly as a result of changes in the detailed ramp designs associated with Cut 18.
All Reefs Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2014 is: Measured and Indicated: 3,178.7 Mton 2013: 3,085.2 Mton at 0.125 oz ton 2013: 0.125 oz ton.
Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
At Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines dormant tailings dams have been evaluated and are separately reported as Tailings Mineral Resources.
Main Sulphide Zone: Anglo American Platinum currently reports an effective 100% interest in Southridge Limited, subject to the finalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
Main Sulphide Zone Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2014 is: Measured and Indicated: 151.2 Mton 2013: 152.2 Mton at 0.123 oz ton 2013: 0.124 oz ton.
