101 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements Our application of materiality Materiality is a key part of planning and executing our audit strategy.
For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, we define materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, in light of the surrounding circumstances, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
As we develop our audit strategy, we determine materiality at the overall financial statement level and at the individual account level.
Performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account level.
In assessing whether errors are material, either individually or in aggregate, we consider qualitative as well as quantitative factors.
Planning Materiality When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected and undetected misstatements that we judged would be material for the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$ 17.0 million 2013: US$ 18.4 million which is approximately 5% 2013: 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit which is explained below.
We believe this provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining planning materiality and the most relevant performance measure for the stakeholders of the group.
In 2014 profit before tax was adjusted by US$29 million mainly relating to the costs associated with the reorganisation of the Group that we concluded are non-recurring and therefore added back when calculating materiality.
This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
Performance Materiality On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that overall performance materiality i. e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance for the Group was 50% 2013:50% of planning materiality, namely US$ 8.5 million 2013: US$ 9.2 million.
Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that the total uncorrected and undetected audit differences did not exceed our planning materiality of US$17 million for the financial statements as a whole.
Reporting Threshold We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$ 0.85 million 2013: US$ 0.92 million, which is set at 5% of planning materiality.
We report all corrected audit differences that in our view warrant reporting on qualitative grounds or where the corrected difference exceeds performance materiality.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accountings policies are appropriate to the Groups and Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 102 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements An overview of the scope of our audit For the Parent company our assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality determines our audit scope for the Parent company financial statements.
This helps us to form an opinion on the company financial statements under the International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
For the Group - our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of that materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group which, when taken together, enable us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements under International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
We take into account the size, risk profile, changes in the business environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The range of performance materiality allocated to components in 2014 was US$ 1.7 million to US$ 6.4 million.
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or by component auditors from another EY global network firm operating under our instructions.
The Group engagement team performed the audit of the consolidation in Amsterdam.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, our Group audit scope focused on the Groups main operating locations.
We selected five components covering entities within the Netherlands, Belgium, and Kazakhstan, which represent the principal business units within the Group and account for 99% of the Groups profit before tax.
Two of these components were subject to a full scope audit, whereas the remaining three were subject to audit procedures on specific accounts based on our risk assessment.
The two full scope components account for 97% of the Group net assets, 99% of the Groups revenue and 99% of the Groups profit before tax.
The specific scope locations do not have operating activities and we audited cash, payroll, the employee share option plan, other current liabilities and the costs associated with the reorganisation of the Group.
We are satisfied that the components selected have provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified below.
The audit work performed at the five components was executed based on levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity.
These materiality thresholds were lower than Group materiality.
For the remaining components we assessed group wide controls and performed analytical reviews and enquiry procedures to address the residual risk of material misstatement.
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned site visits that was designed to ensure that a senior member of the team visited each of the three audit locations at least once a year.
In 2014, the Group audit team including the Senior Statutory Auditor, who leads the audit, visited Kazakhstan where the operations of the Group take place.
These visits involved discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from the work with the component team.
The Group audit team interacted regularly with the component team during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and the direction of the audit process.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level in Amsterdam, gave us appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considered future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
103 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements We have identified the risks of material misstatement which had the greatest effect on the audit strategy and directed the efforts and resources of the engagement team to: Impairment of exploration licenses and goodwill Estimation of oil and gas reserves and its impact of the estimation of DDA expense Revenue recognition Completeness of related party transactions and the related disclosures Risk of management override Our responses to the risk of material misstatement identified Impairment of exploration licenses and goodwill Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78, the estimates and judgments on page 123 and the disclosures in note 6 of the Group Financial Statements The potential impairment of goodwill and We focused on this area as it involves complex and exploration licenses is a key area of audit focus subjective judgements about forecasts.
In evaluating due to their value.
Further, management are whether any impairment was necessary to the remaining required to make a number of significant carrying value of goodwill and other assets, our audit judgements in determining the recognition of, work involved obtaining evidence regarding their and the carrying value of these assets and in recoverable amount.
We utilised our valuation determining whether there are any indicators of specialists and challenged managements impairment impairment.
The fall in oil prices will impact assessment by evaluating the following key financial performance, as well as increase the risk assumptions: of uncommercial exploration activities and potential non-renewal of exploration licenses.
forecast cash flows by comparing the assumptions used within the impairment model to the approved budgets, business plans and other evidence of future intentions: forecast oil prices were compared to independent external sources: and the discount rate was benchmarked to the risks faced by the group.
We assessed the historical accuracy of managements budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual performance.
We evaluated managements sensitivity analysis of goodwill impairment testing in order to assess the potential impact of a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
We evaluated the financial statement disclosures for compliance with the requirements of accounting standards.
Estimation of oil and gas reserves and its impact of the estimation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation DDA expense Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78, the estimates and judgments on page 122 and the disclosures in note 8 of the Group Financial Statements This was considered to be a significant risk due We gained an understanding of the Groups internal to the subjective nature of reserves estimates and process for reserves estimation and challenged Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 104 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements their impact on the financial statements through managements assumptions including commercial impairment and DD&A calculations.
Management assumptions to ensure that they are based on has engaged a third party expert in connection supportable evidence.
In doing so, we have: with the estimation of reserves.
met with managements third party expert during the planning and execution of the audit and assessed their competence as well as that of internal specialists involved in due diligence procedures over oil and gas reserves: reviewed the final oil and gas reserves estimation report prepared by managements third party expert in light of our understanding of the business and agreed key financial inputs to corroborative evidence: and assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions such as oil price, gas and LPG price, opex and capex per barrel by comparing them to external data.
Revenue recognition Refer to the Group Audit Committee report on page 78, and the disclosures of revenue in note 22 of the Group Financial Statements The risk of recognising revenue in the wrong We identified and tested controls over the sales process, period is heightened due to the complexity of the made enquiries of management and analysed contracts Production Sharing Agreement the PSA and to evaluate whether revenue was recognised in the point at which title passes to the customer accordance with the terms.

Risk of management override We consider the likelihood of management We considered whether there was evidence of bias by override occurring.
We base our consideration the Directors in significant accounting estimates and on our understanding of the nature and risk of judgements.
We tested journal entries and also both managements opportunity and incentive to assessed the control environment and interviewed manipulate earnings or financial ratios or to internal audit.
Specifically we considered the heightened expectations following the premium listing of the Group on the LSE and the sizable shareholdings of senior executives.

Subsoil use rights terms Zhaikmunai LLP carries out its activities in accordance with the Contract for Additional Exploration, Production and Production-Sharing of Crude Hydrocarbons in the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field the Contract dated 31 October 1997 between the State Committee of Investments of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Zhaikmunai LLP in accordance with the license MG No.
253D for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field.
On 17 August 2012 Zhaikmunai LLP signed Asset Purchase Agreements to acquire 100% of the subsoil use rights related to three oil and gas fields Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and  all located in the Western Kazakhstan region.
On 1 March 2013 Zhaikmunai LLP has acquired the subsoil use rights related to these Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 112 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued three oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan following the signing of the respective supplementary agreements related thereto by the Ministry of Oil and Gas the MOG of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The term of the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 25-year production period.
The exploration period was initially extended for additional 4 years and then for further 2 years according to the supplements to the Contract dated 12 January 2004 and 23 June 2005, respectively.
In accordance with the supplement dated 5 June 2008, Tournaisian North reservoir entered into production period as at 1 January 2007.
Following additional commercial discoveries during 2008, the exploration period under the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights, other than for the Tournaisian horizons, was extended for an additional 3-year period, which expired on 26 May 2011.
A further extension to 26 May 2014 was made under the supplement dated 28 October 2013.
The extensions to the exploration periods have not changed the Chinarevskoye subsoil use rights term, which expires in 2031.
Zhaikmunai LLP applied to the MOG for another extension of the exploration period.
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Rostoshinskoye field dated 8 February 2008 originally included a 3-year exploration period and a 12-year production period.
On 27 April 2009 the exploration period was extended so as to have a total duration of 6 years.
In January 2012 the MOG made the decision to extend the exploration period until 8 February 2015 and the corresponding supplementary agreement between MOG and Zhaikmunai LLP was signed on 9 August 2013 Note 36.
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from Darjinskoye field dated 28 July 2006 originally included a 6-year exploration period and a 19-year production period.
On 21 October 2008 the exploration period was extended for 6 months so as to expire on 28 January 2013.
On 27 April 2009 the exploration period was extended until 28 January 2015.
On 23 January 2014 the exploration period was further extended until 31 December 2015.
The contract for exploration and production of hydrocarbons from  field dated 28 July 2006 originally included a 5-year exploration period and a 20-year production period.
On 27 April 2009 the exploration period was extended until 28 July 2012.
On 8 July 2011 the exploration period was further extended until 28 July 2014.
Royalty payments Zhaikmunai LLP is required to make monthly royalty payments throughout the entire production period, at the rates specified in the Contract.
Royalty rates depend on hydrocarbons recovery levels and the phase of production and can vary from 3% to 7% of produced crude oil and from 4% to 9% of produced natural gas.
Royalty is accounted on a gross basis.
Government profit share Zhaikmunai LLP makes payments to the Government of its profit share as determined in the Contract.
The profit share depends on hydrocarbon production levels and varies from 10% to 40% of production after deducting royalties and reimbursable expenditures.
Reimbursable expenditures include operating expenses, costs of additional exploration and development costs.
Government profit share is expensed as incurred and paid in cash.
Government profit share is accounted on a gross basis.
Change in estimates The volumes of hydrocarbons extracted and the sales prices of the products form the basis of the royalty and government profit share calculations.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 Zhaikmunai LLP changed the calculation of the coefficient of natural gas equivalent from density ratio used in the prior periods to compression ratio based on newly received researches on the conversion coefficient conducted by independent consultants.
As a result Zhaikmunai LLP revised the calculations of the royalty and government profit share for the prior periods.
This change in estimate was applied prospectively since updated information on composition of the natural gas became available only in 2014.
Also during the year ended 31 December 2014 Zhaikmunai LLP reassessed the 113 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued government profit share for 2013 following the revision of the work program for the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field operations.
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules DTR of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in the United Kingdom as applicable to annual financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value as stated in the accounting policies Note 4.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousands, except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires from management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2014.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control.
To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee: rights arising from other contractual arrangements: the Groups voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 114 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Group reorganisation The Group has been formed through a reorganisation in which Nostrum Oil & Gas plc became a new parent entity of the Group Note 15.
The reorganisation is not a business combination and does not result in any change of economic substance of the Group.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Nostrum Oil & Gas plc are a continuation of the existing group Nostrum Oil & Gas LP and its subsidiaries.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the difference in share capital as an adjustment to equity Other reserves that is not subject to reclassification to income statement in the future periods.
Going concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Group The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2014: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and must be applied retrospectively, subject to certain transition relief.
The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.
These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group qualifies to be an investment entity under IFRS 10.
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 These amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off' and the criteria for nonsimultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively.
These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group has any offsetting arrangements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Disclosures on Recoverable Amount for Non-financial Assets These amendments eliminate unintended consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in part of information disclosure according to IAS 36 Asset Impairment.
Besides, these amendments require disclosing the recoverable amount of assets or cash generation unit CGU on which the impairment loss was recognized or recovered during the reporting period.
These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required.
These amendments have no impact on the Group as the Group has not novated its derivatives during the current or prior periods.
IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs.
For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached.
Retrospective application is required for IFRIC 21.
This interpretation has no impact on the Group as it has applied the recognition 115 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued principles under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets consistent with the requirements of IFRIC 21 in prior years.
Standards issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Groups consolidated financial statements are disclosed below.
The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory.
Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 2009, 2010 and 2013 is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Groups financial assets and the Groups financial liabilities.
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS 14 is an optional standard that allows an entity, whose activities are subject to rate-regulation, to continue applying most of its existing accounting policies for regulatory deferral account balances upon its first-time adoption of IFRS.
Entities that adopt IFRS 14 must present the regulatory deferral accounts as separate line items on the statement of financial position and present movements in these account balances as separate line items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The standard requires disclosures on the nature of, and risks associated with, the entitys rate-regulation and the effects of that rate-regulation on its financial statements.
IFRS 14 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
Since the Group is an existing IFRS preparer, this standard does not apply.
Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions IAS 19 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for defined benefit plans.
Where the contributions are linked to service, they should be attributed to periods of service as a negative benefit.
These amendments clarify that, if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, an entity is permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the service is rendered, instead of allocating the contributions to the periods of service.
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014.
It is not expected that this amendment would be relevant to the Group, since none of the entities within the Group have defined benefit plans with contributions from employees or third parties.
Annual improvements 2010-2012 Cycle These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
They include: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment This improvement is applied prospectively and clarifies various issues relating to the definitions of performance and service conditions which are vesting conditions, including: A performance condition must contain a service condition A performance target must be met while the counterparty is rendering service A performance target may relate to the operations or activities of an entity, or to those of another entity in the same group Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 116 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued A performance condition may be a market or non-market condition If the counterparty, regardless of the reason, ceases to provide service during the vesting period, the service condition is not satisfied It is not expected that this amendment would have impact on the Groups future consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities or assets arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 or IAS 39, as applicable.
It is not expected that this amendment would have any impact on the Groups future consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments The amendments are applied retrospectively and clarify that: An entity must disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria in paragraph 12 of IFRS 8, including a brief description of operating segments that have been aggregated and the economic characteristics e. g. sales and gross margins used to assess whether the segments are similar The reconciliation of segment assets to total assets is only required to be disclosed if the reconciliation is reported to the chief operating decision maker, similar to the required disclosure for segment liabilities.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that the asset may be revalued by reference to observable data on either the gross or the net carrying amount.
In addition, the accumulated depreciation or amortisation is the difference between the gross and carrying amounts of the asset.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Groups future consolidated financial statements considering that the Group's property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity an entity that provides key management personnel services is a related party subject to the related party disclosures.
In addition, an entity that uses a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services.
These amendments are not expected to have effect on the Groups future consolidated financial statements, since the Group always disclosed the companies providing management services as related parties.
Annual improvements 2011-2013 Cycle These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
They include: IFRS 3 Business Combinations The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies for the scope exceptions within IFRS 3 that: Joint arrangements, not just joint ventures, are outside the scope of IFRS 3 This scope exception applies only to the accounting in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself These amendments are not expected to have impact on the Groups future consolidated financial statements, since the Group has no joint arrangements.
117 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 or IAS 39, as applicable.
It is not expected that the amendment will have material effect on the Groups financial position or performance.
IAS 40 Investment Property The description of ancillary services in IAS 40 differentiates between investment property and owner-occupied property i. e. property, plant and equipment.
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that IFRS 3, and not the description of ancillary services in IAS 40, is used to determine if the transaction is the purchase of an asset or business combination.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early adoption permitted.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting.
The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained.
In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party.
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset.
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets.
The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements.
Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 118 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively.
For first-time adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in their separate financial statements, they will be required to apply this method from the date of transition to IFRS.
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material change to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Oil and gas reserves Oil and gas reserves are a material factor in the Groups computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization the DD&A.
The Group estimates its reserves of oil and gas in accordance with the methodology of the Society of Petroleum Engineers the SPE.
In estimating its reserves under SPE methodology, the Group uses long-term planning prices which are also used by management to make investment decisions about development of a field.
Using planning prices for estimating proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in using year-end spot prices.
Management believes that long-term planning price assumptions Note 6 are more consistent with the long-term nature of the upstream business and provide the most appropriate basis for estimating oil and gas reserves.
All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data.
The relative degree of uncertainty can be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
Proved reserves are more certain to be recovered than unproved reserves and may be further sub-classified as developed and undeveloped to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
Estimates are reviewed and revised annually.
Revisions occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geological, reservoir or production data: availability of new data: or changes to underlying price assumptions.
Reserve estimates may also be revised due to improved recovery projects, changes in production capacity or changes in development strategy.
Proved developed reserves are used to calculate the unit of production rates for DD&A.
The estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows also impact the impairment assessment of the Group.
Fair value of financial instruments Where the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flows model.
The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values.
The judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
Abandonment and site restoration provision The Group estimates future dismantlement and site restoration costs for oil and gas properties with reference to the estimates provided from either internal or external engineers after taking into consideration the anticipated method of dismantlement and the extent of site restoration required in accordance with current legislation and industry practice.
The amount of the provision is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted at applicable rate.
"The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each date of financial position and adjusts it to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with 119 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued IFRIC 1 ""Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities""."
Estimating the future closure costs involves significant estimates and judgments by management.
Significant judgments in making such estimates include estimate of discount rate and timing of cash flow.
The management made its estimate based on the assumption that cash flow will take place at the expected end of the subsoil use rights.
Management of the Group believes that the long term interest rates on the Eurobonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall provide best estimates of applicable risk uncorrected discount rate.
The discount rate shall be applied to the nominal risk adjusted amounts the management expects to spend on site restoration in the future.
The Group estimates future well abandonment cost using current year prices and the average long-term inflation rate.
Due to fact that cash outflows related to abandonment and site restoration cost are mainly denominated in USD, during the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group revisited the assumptions used, including abandonment cost, US$ inflation rate and discount rates.
All these changes resulted in increase of abandonment and site restoration provision and respective asset in the amount of US$ 4,306 thousand.
These changes were accounted for prospectively.
The long term inflation and discount rates used to determine the balance sheet obligation at 31 December 2014 were 3.75% and 4.88% respectively.
Movements in the provision for decommissioning liability are disclosed in Note 18.
Taxation Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income.
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax bases of income and expense already recorded.
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates.
The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the Group and the responsible tax authority.
Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar the US dollar or US$.
The functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries is the US dollar, except for Condensate functional currency of which is Kazakhstani Tenge the Tenge.
Transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Groups subsidiaries at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
All differences are taken to the profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 120 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest NCI in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure NCI in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Those acquired petroleum reserves and resources that can be reliably measured are recognised separately in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably measured, are not recognised separately, but instead are subsumed in goodwill.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value, and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
It is then considered in the determination of goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
All contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities or assets arising from a business combination are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 or IAS 39, as applicable.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for NCI over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred bargain purchase, before recognising a gain, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a Cash Generating Unit CGU and part of the operation in that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained.
Property, plant and equipment Exploration expenditure Geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Costs directly associated with exploration wells are capitalised within exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated.
These costs include employee remuneration and materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors and asset retirement obligation fees.
If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity e. g. the drilling of additional wells, it is probable that they can be commercially developed, the costs continue to be carried as an asset while sufficient continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the hydrocarbons.
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
When this is no longer the case, the 121 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued costs are written off.
The exploration expenditure expensed to profit or loss during 2014 amounted to nil 2013: US$ 3,810 thousand.
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are initially capitalised in exploration and evaluation assets.
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
If no future activity is planned or the subsoil use rights have been relinquished or has expired, the carrying value of the subsoil use rights acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss.
Upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas properties.
Oil and gas properties Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as treatment facilities, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as oil and gas properties.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation and the initial estimate of decommissioning obligation, if any.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain construction development costs ceases and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new developments All capitalised costs of oil and gas properties are amortised using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed reserves of the field, except the Group depreciates its oil pipeline and oil loading terminal on a straight line basis over the life of the relevant subsoil use rights.
In the case of assets that have a useful life shorter than the lifetime of the field the straight line method is applied.
Oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of commercially viable hydrocarbons which existing geological, geophysical and engineering data show to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs.
The Group uses the reserve estimates provided by an independent appraiser on an annual basis to assess the oil and gas reserves of its oil and gas fields.
These reserve quantities are used for calculating the unit of production depreciation rate as it reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits by the Group.
Advances for non-current assets Advances paid for capital investments acquisition of non-current assets shall be qualified as advances for non-current assets regardless of the period of supplies of relevant assets or the supply of work or services to close advances.
Advances paid for the purchase of non-current assets are recognised by the Group as non-current assets and are not discounted.
Other properties All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the year in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 122 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Years Buildings and constructions 7-15 Vehicles 8 Machinery and equipment 3-13 Other 3-10 Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
If any such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
An asset groups recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset group is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognized in the profit or loss.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs on qualifying assets.
Assets qualifying for borrowing costs capitalisation include all assets under construction that are not being depreciated, depleted, or amortized, provided that work is in progress at that time.
Qualifying assets mostly include wells and other operations field infrastructure under construction.
Capitalised borrowing costs are calculated by applying the capitalisation rate to the expenditures on qualifying assets.
The capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the Groups 123 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued borrowings that are outstanding during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value NRV.
Cost of oil, gas condensate and liquefied petroleum gas LPG is determined on the weighted-average method based on the production cost including the relevant expenses on depreciation, depletion and impairment and overhead costs based on production volume.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses.
Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Abandonment and site restoration decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognized in full, on a discounted cash flow basis, when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that provision can be made.
The amount of the obligation is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation adjusted for expected inflation and discounted at applicable rate.
The unwinding of the discount related to the obligation is recorded in finance costs.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognized as part of the cost of the related oil and gas properties.
This asset is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the oil and gas properties on a unit-ofproduction basis.
Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning liability that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or changes to the discount rate: a are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
If deducted from the cost of the asset the amount deducted shall not exceed its carrying amount.
If a decrease in the provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognized immediately in the profit or loss: and b if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
If it is such an indication, the Group tests the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and accounts for any impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36.
Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Groups financial assets include cash, long-term and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 124 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR, less impairment.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in finance costs.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivables are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense credit in the period in which they become known.
Derecognition A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognized when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognized to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
125 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Financial assets carried at amortized cost For financial assets carried at amortized cost the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the profit or loss.
Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
The interest income is recorded as part of finance income in the profit or loss.
Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realized or has been transferred to the Group.
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account.
If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to finance costs in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR.
Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortization is included in finance cost in the profit or loss.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the profit or loss.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 126 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions: reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same: discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 35.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses hedging contracts for oil export sales to cover part of its risks associated with oil price fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to profit or loss.
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and at hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, but exclude any restricted cash which is not available for use by the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid for example, cash set aside to cover decommissioning obligations.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Taxation Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that apply to the relevant taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit or loss.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred income tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from 127 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Revenue recognition The Group sells crude oil, gas condensate and LPG under agreements priced by reference to Platts and or Argus index quotations and adjusted for freight, insurance and quality differentials where applicable.
The Group sells gas under agreements at fixed prices.
Revenue from the sale of crude oil, gas condensate, gas and LPG is recognized when delivery has taken place and risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer.
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in other reserves.
Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no distributions are accepted in relation to them.
Share options exercised during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares.
Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and distribution yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 28.
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On 19 May 2014 the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Prolag BVBA Prolag and Amersham Oil LLP Amersham, companies providing management and consulting services to the Group, from related parties of the Group, in connection with the premium listing on the London Stock Exchange of the Groups listed entity, so as to comply with certain exchange requirements that listed companies be managed by persons employed by entities within the listed companys group.
A cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of US$1 and a price adjustment of US$212 thousand was agreed and paid with respect to the acquisition of Prolag.
Historically, Prolag provided consulting services to the Group on certain marketing, transportation and logistics matters.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 128 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued It was agreed that Amersham be acquired in exchange for a cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of US$1,915 thousand, subject to a price adjustment based on accounts of Amersham at 31 December 2014.
The amount of the price adjustment with respect to the acquisition of Amersham has not yet been agreed or paid as at the date of the authorisation of the financial statements for issue, but it is estimated at US$487 thousand.
Respective liability for this amount has been recognised within other current liabilities Note 21 as at 31 December 2014.
Certain managers of the Group historically provided services to the Group pursuant to a service agreement between Amersham and the Group.
The goodwill arising on acquisition represents the savings of the Group on management fees and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
There were no significant revenues or profits losses of the acquired subsidiaries since the respective acquisition dates included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.

V. Probel, a company providing management and consulting services to the Group, from Groups related parties, in exchange for a cash consideration consisting of initial purchase price of US$28,836 thousand and a price adjustment of US$4,598 thousand estimated as at the acquisition date based on accounts of Probel at 30 December 2013.
The actual amount of price adjustment agreed was US$3,631 thousand and paid on 18 June 2014.

Respectively, goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying cash generating unit.
The management has determined a single cash-generating unit within the Groups non-current assets consisting of all Groups assets related to its Chinarevskoye and exploration fields and gas treatment facility.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount is determined by calculation of the value-in-use based on discounted cash flow model as no recent third party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The value-in-use calculation model, which formally approved by the management, takes into consideration cashflows, which are expected to arise until 2032, i. e. during the license term of the Chinarevskoye field.
The period exceeding five years is believed to be appropriate based on the proved and probable reserves audited by independent engineers and respective past history of the Groups ability to transfer probable reserves into proved.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions are: Oil prices for 2015-2022 are based on the forward curve of the ICE Brent Oil Futures, and for 2023-2032 are kept constant at the level applied for 2022: Proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves confirmed by independent reserve engineers: Production profiles based on Groups internal estimates confirmed by independent reserve engineers: All cashflows are projected on the basis of stable prices, i. e. inflation growth rates are ignored: Cost profiles for the development of the fields and subsequent operating costs consistent with reserves estimates and production profiles: and Pre-tax discount rate of 14%.
None of the reasonably possible changes in key assumptions causes the cash generating units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

These generally vest over a five year period from the date of grant, so that one fifth of granted SARs vests on each of the five anniversaries from 145 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued the date of grant.
The contractual life of the SARs is ten years.
The fair value of the SARs is measured at the grant date using a trinomial lattice valuation option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
SARs are exercisable at any time after vesting till the end of the contractual life and give its holder a right to a difference between the market value of the Groups ordinary shares at the date of exercise and a stated base value.
The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period.
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss as part of the employee benefit expenses arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
The carrying value of the liability relating to 2,611,413 of SARs at 31 December 2014 is US$ 6,449 thousand 31 December 2013: 2,912,348 SARs with carrying value of US$ 12,016 thousand.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 302,000 SARs were fully vested 2013:728,487.

The weighted average fair value of SARs granted during the year ended 31 December 2013 amounted to US$ 6.22 per SAR.
The weighted average price at the date of exercise for SARs exercised during the year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to US$ 8.22 per SAR 2013: US$ 8.22 per SAR.
The Hull-White trinomial lattice valuation model was used to value the share options.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the plan for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 GDR 2013 or ordinary share 2014 price at the reporting date US$ 6.6 13.0 3.0% Distribution yield % 3.0% Expected volatility % 85.0% 85.0% Risk-free interest rate % 1.0% 2.0% Expected life years 10.0 10.0 10.0% Option turnover % 10.0% Price trigger 2.0 2.0 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Option turnover rate represents the rate of employees expected to leave the Company during the vesting period, which is based on historical data and is may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The model considers that when share price reaches the level of exercise price multiplied by the price trigger the employees are expected to exercise their options.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS Taxation Kazakhstans tax legislation and regulations are subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations.
Instances of inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax authorities are not unusual.
The current regime of penalties and interest related to reported and discovered violations of Kazakhstans tax laws are severe.
Penalties are generally 50% of the taxes additionally assessed and interest is assessed at the refinancing rate established by the National Bank of Kazakhstan multiplied by 2.5.
As a result, penalties and interest can amount to multiples of any assessed taxes.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by tax authorities for five calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Because of the uncertainties associated with Kazakhstans tax system, the ultimate amount of taxes, penalties and interest, if any, may be in excess of the amount expensed to date and accrued at 31 December 2014.
As at 31 December 2014 management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Groups tax position will be sustained.
Abandonment and site restoration decommissioning As Kazakh laws and regulations concerning site restoration and clean-up evolve, the Group may incur future costs, the amount of which is currently indeterminable.
Such costs, when known, will be provided for as new information, legislation and estimates evolve.
Environmental obligations The Group may also be subject to loss contingencies relating to regional environmental claims that may arise from the past operations of the related fields in which it operates.
As Kazakh laws and regulations evolve concerning environmental assessments and site restoration, the Group may incur future costs, the amount of which is currently indeterminable due to such factors as the ultimate determination of responsible parties associated with these costs 151 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued and the Governments assessment of respective parties ability to pay for the costs related to environmental reclamation.
However, depending on any unfavourable claims or penalties assessed by the Kazakh regulatory agencies, it is possible that the Groups future results of operations or cash flow could be materially affected in a particular period.
Capital commitments As at 31 December 2014 the Group had contractual capital commitments in the amount of US$248,644 thousand 31 December 2013: US$26,842 thousand mainly in respect to the Groups oil field development activities.

The lease agreements may be early terminated either upon mutual agreement of the parties, or unilaterally by one of the parties if the other party does not fulfil its obligations under the contract.
The total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases was represented as follows: In thousands of US Dollars 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 No later than one year 14,788 12,501 Later than one year and no later than five years 17,671 23,846 Later than five years Lease expenses of railway tank wagons for the year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to US$14,622 thousand FY 2013: US$12,628 thousand.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, payables to Government of Kazakhstan, trade payables and other current liabilities.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the development of the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field and its operations as well as exploration of the three new oil and gas fields Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and .
The Group's financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, non-current investments, current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in price of crude oil, which is quoted in US Dollar on the international markets.
The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of crude oil prices in the future.
Interest rate risk The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in 2014 and 2013 as the Group had no financial instruments with floating rates as at years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013.
Foreign currency risk As a significant portion of the Groups operation is the Tenge denominated, the Groups statement of financial position can be affected by movements in the US dollar Tenge exchange rates.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposure by borrowing in US dollars and denominating sales in US dollars.
153 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollars exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax.
The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax.
Change in Tenge to US Dollar exchange Effect on profit rate before tax 2014 US Dollar thousand 17.37% 1,168 US Dollar thousand - 17.37% 1,168 2013 US Dollar thousand 30.00% 3,294 US Dollar thousand 10.00% 1,098 During the year ended 31 December 2014 a significant drop in oil prices and some other non-economic factors were observed which caused increase in volatility of Tenge exchange rates and overall market volatility.
Statistics for the year ended 31 December 2014 reflect the expected behaviour of market in 2015.
The ranges of reasonably possible changes in market risk variables were estimated by analysing annual standard deviations based on the historical market data for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities were as follows: Russian Tenge Roubles Euro Other Total As at 31 December 2014 Cash and cash equivalents 8,713 10,307 106 19,126 Trade receivables 12,331 12,331 Trade payables 27,030 965 3,479 256 31,730 Other current liabilities 19,331 115 7,010 7 26,463 25,317 1,080 182 157 26,736 Russian As at 31 December 2013 Tenge Roubles Euro Other Total Cash and cash equivalents 5,491 3,492 8,983 Trade receivables 27,619 1 27,620 Trade payables 42,950 372 2,472 5 45,799 Other current liabilities 257 7,173 7,430 10,097 372 6,152 5 16,626 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with its financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.
The tool allows selecting severe stress test scenarios.
To ensure an adequate level of liquidity a minimum cash balance has been defined as a cushion of liquid assets.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of notes, loans, hedges, export financing and financial leases.
Additional disclosures Regulatory information Financial report Corporate governance Strategic report 154 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued The Groups policy is that, while it has an investment program on-going: a not more than 25% of borrowings should mature in the next twelve-month period and b a minimum balance of US$ 50 million is retained on the balance sheet post repayment or refinancing of any debt due in the next twelve-month period.
The Group's total outstanding debt consists of two notes: US$ 560 million issued in 2012 and maturing in 2019 and US$ 400 million issued in 2014 and maturing in 2019.
The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December 2014 and 2013 based on contractual undiscounted payments: On Less than 3-12 more than As at 31 December 2014 demand 3 months months 1-5 years 5 years Total 1,287,000 Borrowings 12,750 52,650 1,221,600 Trade payables 48,095 1,524 49,619 Other current liabilities 18,126 18,126 Due to the government of Kazakhstan 258 773 4,124 11,340 16,495 66,221 13,008 54,947 1,225,724 11,340 1,371,240 On Less than 3-12 more than demand 3 months months 1-5 years 5 years Total As at 31 December 2013 898,206 Borrowings 43,613 259,902 594,691 Trade payables 58,518 58,518 Other current liabilities 20,571 20,571 Due to the government of Kazakhstan 258 773 4,124 12,371 17,526 79,089 258 44,386 264,026 607,062 994,821 Credit risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to credit risk, consist primarily of derivative financial instruments, accounts receivable and cash in banks.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The Group considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of trade accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
The Group places its Tenge denominated cash with SB Sberbank JSC, which has a credit rating of Ba3 stable from Moody's rating agency and its US Dollar denominated cash with BNP Paribas with a credit rating of A1 negative and ING with a credit rating of A2 negative from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2014.
The Group does not guarantee obligations of other parties.
The Group sells its products and makes advance payments only to recognized, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts and recoverability of prepayments made is not significant and thus risk of credit default is low.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Groups established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
The Group does not 155 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2014 Consolidated financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued hold collateral as security.
The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets.
Fair values of financial instruments Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments, other than those with carrying amounts reasonably approximating their fair values: Carrying amount Fair value 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December In thousands of US Dollars 2014 2013 2014 2013 Financial instruments measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments 60,301 60,301 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Interest bearing borrowings 945,114 628,423 1,037,320 686,795 Total 1,005,415 1,097,621 628,423 686,795 The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities represents the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Fair value of the quoted notes is based on price quotations at the reporting date and respectively categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is categorised as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and is calculated using Black-Scholes valuation model based on Brent Crude Futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange, with the relative expiration dates ranging from the current reporting date until March 2016.
The following table shows ranges of the inputs depending on maturity, which are used in the model for calculation of the fair value of the derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013: 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 59.2-67.9 Future price at the reporting date US$ Historical volatility % 16.02-17.73 Risk-free interest rate % 0.25-0.67 Maturity months 3-15 The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

There were no gains or losses arising during 2013 from fair value measurement of this contingent consideration liability.
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 there were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy of the Groups' financial instruments.
Capital management For the purpose of the Groups capital management, capital includes issued capital, additional paid-in capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.
In order to achieve this overall objective, the Groups capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the notes that define capital structure requirements.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the lenders to immediately call borrowings.
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of the notes in the current period nor the prior period.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the distribution payment to participants, return capital to participants or increase partnership capital.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.
The Groups policy is to keep the gearing ratio between 20% and 40%.
The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash, short-term deposits and long-term deposits.
