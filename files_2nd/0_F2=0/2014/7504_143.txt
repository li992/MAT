Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Other receivables The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 96.2m 2013: 88.6m comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

The carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximates to their fair value, and the currencies in which they are denominated reflect the geographical segments for which they have been used.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: The Group has a 250m revolving credit facility with five banks.
This facility was taken out on 22 July 2011 and has a term of five years.
This provides the Group with sufficient funding to support its strategic objectives.
The financial covenants associated with the credit facilities are net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0 times 2013: 3.0 times and interest cover greater than 4.0 times EBITDA 2013: 4.0 times.
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
The Groups principal borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of 1% 2013: 1% above the relevant reference rate, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had available 114.7m 2013: 120.4m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
