NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Company accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that a parent undertaking includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company reported a profit for the financial year ended 30 April 2014 of 264.8m 2013: 0.9m loss.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Share-based payments The Groups share option plans and restricted shares scheme allows employees to acquire shares in the Betfair Group.
The fair value of these schemes is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, with the exception of cash settled transactions which result in a corresponding increase in other creditors.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to participate in the scheme and is calculated using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Restricted shares are valued with reference to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
They have a vesting period of three years from the first day of the financial year to which they relate and one-third of the shares will vest each year for three years.
All cash settled share-based payments are recorded as a liability and revalued at the market value at the balance sheet date with the difference taken to the profit and loss account, except where the cash component is fixed.
The Company has recognised an increase in investments corresponding to the FRS 20 Share-based payment charge in respect of awards to employees of subsidiary companies.
Cash and liquid resources Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Treasury share transactions The Company has recognised an increase in investments corresponding to the FRS 20 Share-based payment charge.
Director and employee remuneration The Company had no employees other than the Directors during the current or prior year.
The remuneration paid to Directors for services to the Company during the year was paid and accounted for by another entity within the Group.
Details of the Directors remuneration is discussed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 67.
