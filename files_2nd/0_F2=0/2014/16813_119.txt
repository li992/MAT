Commitments A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to leases and agreements to buy assets such as network infrastructure and IT systems.
These amounts are not recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from the supplier.
The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.
Accounting policies Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefitsreceived and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
