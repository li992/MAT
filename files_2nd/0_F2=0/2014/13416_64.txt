Of the total deferred tax assets, 7m 2013: 31m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets of 105m 2013: 54m have not been recognised in respect of losses and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses, including capital losses, of 370m 2013: 217m of which 13m 2013: 5m expire within five years.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted in full, additional tax of 24m 2013: 28m would be payable.
