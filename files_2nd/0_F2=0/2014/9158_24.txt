Defined contribution scheme Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme, at rates specified in the schemes rules, are as follows: millions 2013 14 2012 13 Charge to operating profit 2 2 From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered to all Company employees.
Eligible Company employees have been automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme from 31 March 2013.
Defined benefit scheme Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 1 February 2014.
In the prior year the UK final salary pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from July 2012.
The closure to future accrual resulted in an exceptional non-cash curtailment gain of 1m, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities as benefits are no longer linked to future salary increases other than in line with inflation.
Furthermore, it resulted in a full provision against the net surplus being recognised at the curtailment date.
This exceptional non-cash asset restriction loss of 6m reflected the requirements under UK accounting standards, which restrict the amount of surplus that can be recognised following the closure to future accrual of benefits.
In 2010 11 and 2011 12 the Company entered into two phases of a property partnership arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit.
Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.
The reported pension position, before provision for asset restriction, reflects the Companys share of the resulting scheme asset.

com 127 127 Accounts Notes to the Company financial statements continued 9 Net pension asset continued Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligation of the defined benefit pension scheme are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligation.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.

The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables SAPS tables projected forward to 2013 using the CMI 2013 core projection improvement factors, as published by the UK actuarial profession.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
The allowance is in line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females.
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: 2010 funding Years 2013 14 2012 13 valuation Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 86.7 86.7 86.4 Female 87.3 87.4 87.1 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 87.4 87.4 87.1 Female 88.6 89.0 88.7 10 Commitments Operating lease commitments The Company is a lessee of offices under lease agreements with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.

Options have been exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of exercise, is 3.53 2012 13: 2.81.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from nil to 3.15 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.9 years 2012 13: 4.3 years.
A full list of outstanding options granted by the Company to the Group employees, which includes those held by the Executive Directors, is shown below.
The Executive Directors awards are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 68.
Restricted Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS.
They are granted as nil cost options, as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised.
Vesting dates may vary according to individual grants.
Certain employees, excluding directors, have been granted contingent share awards under the Kingfisher Retention Share Scheme.
The last awards granted under this scheme vested in 2012.
These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period.
The Store Management Incentive Share Scheme provided awards to store managers in 2009 with vesting dates of April 2011 and April 2012.
There were performance conditions based on store standards and awards lapsed if not maintained throughout the performance period.
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with savings under the contract.
The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before the invitation to subscribe, discounted by 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
The Irish and International Sharesave plans, which operate along similar lines to the UK Sharesave scheme, include eligible employees in Ireland and certain overseas locations.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Scheme were in April 2003.
Under these schemes, participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant up to the tenth anniversary, except where the performance conditions have not been met.
The performance conditions for all options have now been met.
On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of shares in the Company.
All options granted under these schemes have either now been exercised or have lapsed.
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
