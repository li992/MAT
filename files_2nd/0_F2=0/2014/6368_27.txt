Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information G4S plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group and the groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities made up to 31 December each year.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being sterling, the US dollar and Euro.
The groups financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primary listing is in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 177.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent companys financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 156 to 164.
Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain non-current assets and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, are discussed in note 4.
The directors considered the groups strategy, liquidity and financial position and reviewed the budget for the next 12 months and the medium-term strategic plan.
As part of this review, various stress test scenarios to assess the adequacy of resources available to the group were considered, including the newly refinanced 1bn revolving credit facility which is largely undrawn but committed and the headroom available within the groups financial covenants.
The directors also considered the risks facing the business and whilst certain risks such as underperformance on major contracts could impact profitability they do not present a material risk to the group.
On completion of the review the directors were satisfied that the group had access to sufficient resources to allow it to execute its strategy and continue to operate for the foreseeable future.
The comparative income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 has been re-presented for operations qualifying as discontinued during the current year.
Revenue from continuing operations has been reduced by 145m and loss before tax has increased by 3m compared to the figures published previously.
Further details of discontinued operations are presented within note 7. b Presentation of the income statement The groups income statement and segmental analysis note separately identify results before specific items.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the underlying results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way aids the understanding of the groups financial performance.
Specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
Any associated reversal will also flow through specific items such that the underlying results reflect the ongoing recurring results of the business.
c Specific items Specific items are those that in managements judgement should be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Specific items include items relating to acquisitions and disposals including amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, results relating to discontinued operations, certain restructuring costs, impairments, onerous contract provisions and other one-off items such as the review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities performed in 2013.
Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 8.
Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 G4S plc G4S plc 103 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued d Basis of consolidation During the year the group has adopted the new consolidation standards IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
The following accounting policies reflect these new standards, and the impact of adopting these standards on the groups financial results and position is given in more detail in note 3 w on page 110.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
Control is achieved where the group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the groups returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity.
This can be determined either by the groups ownership percentage, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
In the case of certain investments, detailed analysis of the different contracts in place is required, together with a level of judgement, to ascertain whether there is control under the definition of IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements see note 4.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred as consideration to the vendor and does not include transaction costs.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
The cost of acquisition includes the present value of deferred and contingent consideration payable, including that in respect of put options held by non-controlling shareholders, as estimated at the date of acquisition.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 subsequent changes to the present value of the estimate of contingent consideration and any difference upon final settlement of such a liability are recognised as adjustments to the cost of acquisition.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2010 such changes are recognised in the income statement with respect to contingent consideration and in other comprehensive income with respect to put options.
Non-controlling interests are stated at their proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Profits and losses are applied in the proportion of their respective ownership to the interest of the parent and to the non-controlling interest.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement which grants the group and other parties joint control over a shared undertaking.
Joint control exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture.
Joint operations A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The groups share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the groups consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
The groups share of post-tax profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
104 104 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements e Foreign currencies The financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in other currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value which are denominated in other currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost denominated in other currencies are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income, together with exchange differences arising on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations and on borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments where and to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective.
On disposal, translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
f Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading purposes.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings, the fair value risk on the groups fixed-rate borrowings, commodity risk in relation to its diesel consumption and foreign exchange risk on transactions on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, commodity swaps, commodity options, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow and net investment hedges The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow or hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
g Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the acquisition method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
No goodwill arises on the acquisition of an additional interest from a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary as this is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life.
The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Trademarks and technology up to a maximum of five years Customer contracts and customer relationships up to a maximum of ten years Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 G4S plc G4S plc 105 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued g Intangible assets continued Other intangible assets Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only if the following can be demonstrated: the expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development.
In all other instances, the cost of such expenditure is taken directly to the income statement.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of eight years.
h Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles 2 to 10 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the expected useful economic life and the term of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.
i Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced through the use of a bad debt allowance account.
The group provides for bad debts based upon an analysis of those that are past due, in accordance with local conditions and past default experience.
Service concession assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project, the control of the asset remains largely with the purchaser of the associated services.
In such cases, the groups interest in the asset is classified as a financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade and other receivables, to the extent to which the group has an unconditional right to receive cash from the grantor of the concession for the construction of the asset.
To the extent that the group has the right to charge for the use of such an asset, conditional upon the extent of the use, the group recognises an intangible asset.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities which are classified as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at fair value, including transaction costs.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flow.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
106 106 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements j Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
k Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, with the exception of inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment and, if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
l Employee benefits Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from the calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, net interest cost, and past service cost.
The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses and other remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
m Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
The amount recognised as a provision is the groups best estimate of the cost of settlement at the end of the reporting period.
In respect of claims and litigation, the group provides for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome.
For all risks, the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.
Management exercise judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities see note 33 through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and in quantifying the possible range of financial outcomes.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discount rate.
n Restructuring provision A restructuring provision is recognised when the group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
The group distinguishes between restructuring costs that are recurring and those restructuring costs that relate to one-off or transformational group programmes that impact a number of operations.
Restructuring costs that are incurred in the normal course of business are recorded as part of the groups trading results.
Restructuring costs that are individually material or relate to programmes linked to the groups wider transformation and require approval at executive level are presented within specific items and disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 G4S plc G4S plc 107 107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued o Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue for manned security and cash solutions products and for recurring services in security systems products is recognised to reflect the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the stage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts Where significant, security system installations with a contract duration in excess of one month are accounted for as construction contracts.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is measured either by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by the proportion that the sales value of work completed to date bears to the total sales value.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement.
Construction contracts are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost plus profit recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
p Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs in respect of major outsourcing contracts incurred after the point at which the group achieves preferred bidder status at which point it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained are capitalised and expensed over the life of the contract, subject to recoverability criteria.
Costs incurred prior to this point are expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs are expensed immediately in the event that preferred bidder status is not followed by the award of the contract.
q Onerous contracts Onerous contract provisions are recognised for losses on contracts where the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
Management plans to recover the position on loss-making contracts require a level of judgement and are only taken into account in the calculation of the onerous contract provision when implementation has commenced and tangible evidence exists of benefits being delivered.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the contract.
Provisions for future losses are charged to the income statement: where onerous contract provisions are material by virtue of their size, incidence or nature they are separately disclosed as specific items.
In-year losses from onerous contracts will continue to be reported in underlying earnings as they are incurred, with provisions for future losses on onerous contracts being unwound against these losses in underlying earnings.
Vacant property provisions are recognised when the group has committed to a course of action that will result in the property becoming vacant.
The provision is calculated based on discounted cash flows to the end of the lease taking into account expected future sub-lease income.
r Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial assets net carrying amount.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
108 108 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements s Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of each deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation.
In situations where uncertainties exist, provision is made for contingent tax liabilities and assets on the basis of management judgement following consideration of the available relevant information.
t Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
On occasion this classification requires a level of judgement.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
u Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
v Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are paid or approved by the shareholders at a general meeting.
Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 G4S plc G4S plc 109 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued w Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations In the year ended 31 December 2014, the group adopted the following new standards and amendments: IFRS 10 2011 Consolidated Financial Statements, which replaces parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and all of SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, introduced a new control model that focuses on whether the group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its power to affect those returns.
This differs from the previous approach where one of the main criteria used to consolidate was to have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
As a result of the adoption of IFRS 10 the group has reclassified certain businesses within the Asia & Middle East region as joint ventures where previously they were classified as subsidiaries.
As a result of applying IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, the group now accounts for these businesses using the equity method.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly Controlled Entities Non-monetary Contributions by Vendors and removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities using the proportionate consolidation method.
Instead all jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, similar to that used to account for associates under the previous standards.
As the group previously applied the proportionate method of accounting to its jointly controlled entities this has impacted the groups consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities is a new and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for entities within the scope of IFRS 10 2011 and IFRS 11.
As a result of adopting this standard the group has re-assessed the criteria used to determine material joint ventures.
The new criteria are based on the contribution of revenue, operating profit and net assets that the joint ventures make to the groups results.
Under these new measures the group has determined that none of its joint ventures are individually material for the purposes of disclosure in accordance with IFRS12.
The group also adopted IAS27 revised Separate Financial Statements and IAS28 Associates and Joint Ventures.
The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
The group has presented a restated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013, restated statements of financial position at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, and a restated cash flow statement for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The following pages contain reconciliations between the restated amounts and those previously published.
The adoption of IFRS10 has resulted in certain businesses in the Asia Middle East region being re-classified as joint ventures rather than subsidiaries.
These businesses were previously consolidated into each of the relevant line items in the groups income statement, statement of cash flows and statement of financial position at 100% of their reported results with an appropriate adjustment made to reflect the non-controlling interests share.
As a result of being classified as joint ventures they fall into the scope of IFRS11 and are now reported using the equity method.
Under the equity method the groups share of the entities post-tax results are shown in the income statement under share of profit from joint ventures and the groups net investment is shown in the statement of financial position under investment in joint ventures, with no adjustment required for non-controlling interests.
In addition the group previously applied the proportionate method of consolidation to its existing joint ventures.
Under the proportionate method of consolidation the group consolidated its share of each relevant line item in the groups income statement, statement of cash flows and statement of financial position.
As a result of adopting IFRS11 the results of these joint ventures are now also consolidated using the equity method as described above.
The income statement reconciliation for the year ended 31 December 2013 separately presents restatements for discontinued operations.

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Those that are expected to have an impact on the group accounts are detailed below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for the year ended 31 December 2018 and removes the multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets required by IAS 39 and replaces it with a model with only two classification categories: amortised cost and fair value.
The business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of those assets drives the classification.
There have been no significant changes to the accounting and presentation for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial instruments.
The group is currently assessing the impact this standard would have on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for the year ended 31 December 2017 and establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
The group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS15.
The following revisions, amendments and improvements are not yet effective and are not expected to have a material impact on the results of the group when they are adopted: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IFRS11 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS16 and IAS38 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments to IAS19 IFRS14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 Cycle and 2011-2013 Cycle 112 112 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements 4.
Accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial techniques.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most significance in preparing the groups 2014 accounts are detailed below: Revenue recognition and contract review The group delivers outsourcing services that in some circumstances can be complex in nature and may be governed by unique contractual arrangements.
There is a risk that revenue recognition on these contracts is not in accordance with contractual entitlements and therefore provisions may be required to be recognised within contract provisions see note 33.
Estimates and judgements are therefore required to determine the appropriate level of provisioning applied to these contracts.
Carrying value of goodwill The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that amounts may be impaired.
The impairment analysis for such assets is based principally upon discounted estimated future cash flows from the use and eventual disposal of the assets.
Such an analysis includes the estimation of future results, cash flows, annual growth rates and discount rates.
Judgement is required in relation to the achievability of the long-term business plan and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation process.
In certain circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained for example, through recent transactions, fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount.
This involves judgments and estimates to apply reasonable valuations techniques and to estimate future selling costs.
The full methodology and results of the groups impairment testing is presented in note 18.
Taxation The group operates in many tax jurisdictions including countries where the tax legislation is not consistently applied and under some complex contractual circumstances where the responsibility for tax arising is not always clear.
Management are required to apply judgements and estimates to determine the appropriate amount of tax to provide for and any required disclosure around contingent tax liabilities at each period end.
Review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, taking into account any changes in facts or circumstances since that date.
The purpose of this review was to ensure that the financial statements were presented in a more balanced way.
This exercise required a level of judgement and in many cases taking a more balanced judgement based on the groups current understanding of circumstances surrounding each issue.
The results of the review were presented within specific items given the one-off nature of the review performed and are disclosed in note 8.
As at 31 December 2014 these estimates and judgements have been updated to reflect any changes in facts or circumstances during the year to 31 December 2014 with any additional charges or reversals also being presented within specific items.
Compliance with foreign ownership rules and consolidation of subsidiaries The group has a diverse set of complex ownership structures, which are sometimes driven by local laws and regulations relating to foreign ownership.
In some instances the group operates through local structures with limited direct share ownership of the business, but exercises control through shareholder agreements.
In determining whether some group entities qualify for consolidation under IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements, professional and legal advice is sought and a level of judgement is required.
Consolidation of any of these entities would be at risk if the groups ability to enforce its rights of control were successfully challenged.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations The valuation of defined retirement benefit schemes is arrived at using the advice of qualified independent actuaries who use the projected unit credit method for determining the groups obligations.
This methodology requires the use of a variety of assumptions and estimates, including the appropriate discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, mortality assumptions, future service and earnings increases of employees and inflation.
Full details of the groups retirement benefit obligations, including an analysis of the sensitivity of the calculations to the key assumptions are presented in note 32.

Acquisitions Current year acquisitions The group did not undertake any material business combinations in the current year.
Prior year acquisitions The group undertook a number of business combinations in the prior year including the acquisition of Deposita, a cash solutions business in South Africa.
The following table sets out the fair value to the group in respect of all acquisitions made in the prior year: Fair value 2013 acquisitions m Intangible assets 15 Property, plant and equipment 2 Deferred tax assets 2 Inventories 4 Trade and other receivables 3 Cash and cash equivalents 1 Trade and other payables 6 Borrowings 4 Deferred tax liabilities 3 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 14 Goodwill 4 Total purchase consideration paid in cash 18 Adjustments were made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition to reflect their fair value.
These included the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 12m.
From their respective dates of acquisition, the acquired businesses contributed 28m to prior year revenues, 4m to prior year operating profit before specific items and 3m to prior year profit for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2013, group revenue for that year would have been 7,067m, operating profit before specific items would have been 418m and total loss for the year would have been 356m.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill allocation Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination.
A significant portion of the groups goodwill was generated by the merger of the security services businesses of Group 4 Falck and Securicor in 2004 which was accounted for as an acquisition of Securicor by Group 4 Falck.
Goodwill impairment testing The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that any of these assets may be impaired.
The annual impairment test is performed prior to the year end when the budgeting process is finalised and reviewed post year end.
The groups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU with its recoverable amount.
CGUs are identified on a country level basis including significant business units, as per the groups detailed management accounts.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations.
The key inputs to the calculations are described below.
In rare circumstances, where market prices can be ascertained for example through recent transactions or by reference to normal industry standard multiples, the fair value less costs to sell is used as a basis for the recoverable amount.
In the current year the value of goodwill in the UK cash business and the Brazil security business was supported by this valuation method.
Forecast cash flows All operating countries in the group are required to submit a budget for the next financial year for the current year test this is for the year ended 31 December 2015 and their strategic plan forecasts for the following two years in this case the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.
The revenue figures submitted as part of this exercise are used to derive a growth rate for the discounted cash flow calculation see the growth rate table below.
The group applies a 10% forecast risk to reduce revenue forecasts in each year to reflect the uncertainties inherent in estimating future revenue streams.
Forecast cash flows are adjusted from year 4 onwards by applying a growth rate as detailed in the growth rate section, and discounted using specific risk-adjusted discount rates as described in the discount rate section.
Growth Rate Growth rates are determined from the budgeted and forecast revenue in years 1-3 and then projected using the lower of the forecast growth rate and the countrys nominal growth rate per the IMF to a terminal growth rate in year 15 of 1% for developed markets or 3% for emerging markets.
This is detailed in the table below: Growth assumptions Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 to 15 Terminal value Input Budget Forecast Forecast Projected to Projected to Projected to Estimate of year 5 at lower year 5 at lower year 15 residual growth: of forecast or of forecast or terminal growth developed 1%: country growth country growth emerging 3% Example 8% 7% 6% 5% 4% 4% to 1% 1% over 10 years Budgets and forecasts are reviewed by the group Board In the above example, budgeted year 1 growth rate is 8%, forecast growth in year 2 is 7% and in year 3 is 6%.
The country growth rate is 4% so the growth rate is reduced each year to reach 4% at year 5.
From year 6 the growth rate is then reduced over the next ten years to provide a terminal value growth of 1% the example is based on a developed market CGU.
126 126 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements Discount rate Discount rates are calculated for each CGU based on the relevant local risk-free rate adjusted for that CGUs specific risk-adjusted equity risk premium.
For the impairment test performed for the year ended 31 December 2014 the group has revised the calculation of the pre-tax discount rates applied to certain CGUs.
This revision adjusts for the current low-interest rate environment by increasing abnormally low pre-tax discount rates.
Details of how the other key discount rate inputs are derived are given below: Input How determined 31 Dec 2014 Risk-free rate The risk-free rate is generally obtained from the local governments 10 year gilt bond rates.
2.35% in UK Where these are unavailable the group uses the closest available information e. g. shorter term gilt rates.
UK equity risk premium The equity risk premium is determined for the UK by analysing a variety of sources including 5.0% in UK economic studies carried out by Barclays Capital and others.
Operating country Specific local equity risk premiums are based on the UK risk premium adjusted for specific equity risk premium economic and financial risks.
The sources for these adjustments are the Institutional Investor Magazine and the IMF website as well as other studies by independent economists.
Leveraged beta Beta is a risk adjustment applied to the discount rate to reflect the risk of the groups 0.8 for the operating companies relative to the market as a whole.
The groups beta is obtained from group independent market studies and is adjusted for the appropriate leverage of the group.
Tax rate Local tax rates are applied to each CGU to calculate pre-tax cost of equity.
21% in UK Debt margin The group applies a margin to the cost of debt for each CGU, with a higher margin applied to 1.5% in UK those CGUs operating in higher risk environments.
These margins range from 1.5% in less risky CGUs for example in the UK to 7% in more risky CGUs e. g. 6.5% in Yemen.
Weighted average The weighted average cost of capital is calculated by weighting the cost of equity and the cost 8.7% in UK cost of capital pre-tax of debt by the applicable debt:equity ratio at the year end.
Within the UK, the most significant CGUs and their goodwill carrying values are UK Care and Justice 247m, UK Cash Solutions 205m and UK Secure Solutions 102m.
Within the USA, the most significant CGU is US Commercial Security Solutions with goodwill of 321m.

Intangible assets continued Impairment There were no impairments recognised during 2014.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, impairment charges totaling 46m were recorded in respect of the groups goodwill, in the following countries: 2013 m Democratic Republic of Congo 4 Malawi 2 Nigeria 4 Brazil 24 Ireland 5 Other impaired 7 Total 46 The impairment charge in Brazil was driven by losses incurred in the first half of 2013 in the technology business and a general turndown in trading.
The impairment in Ireland was as a result of the economic challenges in the country and the specific situation of the groups cash business.
Certain CGUs in Africa were impaired mainly as a result of worsening economic and political circumstances in those countries.
Sensitivity to key assumptions The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rates and growth rates used.
The table below shows the additional impairment that would arise from an increase in discount rates by 1% and 3% with all other variables being equal, for example, taking the UK base rate from 8.7% to 9.7% and 11.7% or a decrease in growth rates by 1% and 3% with all other variables being equal, for example, taking the UK growth rate from 4.0% to 3.0% and 1.0% for the group in total and for each of its significant countries.

At 31 December 2014, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 998m 2013: 965m.
Interest on all committed bank borrowing facilities is at prevailing Libor or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin, and re-priced within one year or less.
In January 2015 the revolving credit facility was refinanced.
The new facility is 1.0bn and matures in January 2020, with two one-year extension options exercisable with lending bank consent on the facilitys first and second anniversary.
If exercised the maturity date would extend to January 2021 and January 2022 respectively.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is discussed in note 31.
The group issued fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$550m 353m on 1 March 2007.

The group issued its inaugural public note of 350m using its European Medium Term Note Programme on 13 May 2009.
During 2012 the group issued two further public notes, a 600m note issued in May 2012 maturing May 2017 and a 500m note issued in December 2012 maturing December 2018.
The committed bank facilities and the private loan notes are subject to one financial covenant net debt to EBITDA ratio where EBITDA is calculated as underlying group PBITA plus depreciation and amortisation of non-acquisition related intangible assets and non-compliance with the covenant may lead to an acceleration of maturity.
The group complied with the financial covenant throughout the year to 31 December 2014 and the year to 31 December 2013.
The group has not defaulted on, or breached the terms of, any material loans during the year.
Bank overdrafts, bank loans, the loan notes issued in July 2008 with the exception of 44m, 510m of the loan notes issued in May 2012 and 380m of the loan notes issued in December 2012 are stated at amortised cost.

Financial risk Capital management Post the year end the group refinanced its 1.1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with a 1.0bn facility that was signed on 7 January 2015.
The new facility is for five years with two extension options exercisable by the banks that potentially results in the facility having a life of seven years.
In August 2014, Standard & Poors confirmed the groups long term credit rating of BBBStable.
The group will continue to manage its capital structure so that it retains an investment grade rating.
The groups policy is to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5 times.
At the end of 2014 the ratio was 2.8 times which reflects the Electronic Monitoring contract settlement.
The ratio is expected to steadily decline as the benefits from the restructuring and business transformation programmes take effect.
At 31 December 2014 the group had 998m of available and undrawn facilities from its committed 1.1bn bank facility.
Following the successful refinancing of its committed bank facility in January 2015, the group has no significant maturity until May 2017 and has a medium to long-term debt maturity profile.
The group is currently well placed to access finance from the debt capital markets and the bank market if required.
Borrowings are principally in sterling, US dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and profits.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it.
For more details of the groups bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes see note 27.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows: 31 December 2013 32% 31 March 2014 32% 30 June 2014 33% 30 September 2014 32% 31 December 2014 34% To reduce re-financing risk, group treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of finance terminating on a single date.
Re-financing risk is further reduced by group treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major medium-term facility at least 12 months before its termination date.

Financial risk continued Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its financing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
At 31 December 2014, the groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 78% and 74% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans 2013: US dollar 82%, Euro 59%.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 101m are in place hedging the foreign currency risk on US$200m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 266m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on 325m of the Euro public notes issued in May 2012, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2217.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 284m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on 350m of the Euro public notes issued in December 2012, effectively fixing the sterling value of this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.2332.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar and the Euro, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 6m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 27 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
At 31 December 2014 the nominal value of such contracts was 103m in respect of US dollar 2013: 97m and 54m in respect of Euro 2013: 37m : their weighted average interest rate was 1.3% US dollar 2013: 1.3% and 0.6% Euro 2013: 2.8 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was three years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors preferring a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, the GBP public notes issued in May 2009, 510m of the Euro public notes issued in May 2012 and 380m of the Euro public notes issued in December 2012 was initially kept at fixed rate.
In April 2014, the interest rate on 44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on all the GBP public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives.
All three public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of G4S plc fall below investment grade.
The core group borrowings are held in US dollar, Euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by fixed rate loans and interest rate swaps which provide certainty on the vast majority of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2014 debt position constant throughout 2015, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 11m in the 2015 financial year.
140 140 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
Commodity swaps and commodity options are used to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Commodity swaps hedging 23 million litres of projected 2015 diesel consumption and 10 million litres of projected 2016 diesel consumption were in place at 31 December 2014.
Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark-to-market value outstanding with each counterparty is also closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
For short-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2014 the largest two counterparty exposures related to treasury transactions were 33m and 21m and both were held with institutions with a long-term Standard & Poors credit rating of A.
These exposures represent 43% and 27% of the carrying values of the treasury transactions, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2014.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 300m were pooled with debit balances of 301m, resulting in a net pool overdraft balance of 1m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of 3m.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution, multi-employer and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 96m 2013: 99m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants in 2004, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defined contribution scheme.
The group disposed of its interest in G4S Government Solutions, Inc. during the year.
G4S Government Solutions, Inc. was the administrator of several defined benefit schemes and was responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defined benefit schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and G4S Government Solutions, Inc. its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes were accounted for as defined contribution schemes up until the date of disposal in November 2014.
Multi-employer arrangement In the Netherlands, most of the employees are members of the Security Industry Wide Pension Fund IWPF.
This is a career-average defined benefit plan.
Pensionable salary is subject to a cap, and minus an offset that reflects social security levels.
Withdrawal from the scheme is only possible under certain strict conditions determined by Dutch law and by the pension fund board of the IWPF.
The plan is funded by a premium that is set by the IWPF board in line with the financing rules that state that the premium should cover the cost of the annual accrual of pension benefits.
Historically, the premium has been 30% of pensionable salaries and the employer pays 60% of this premium and the employees the remaining 40%.
The financing rules specify that an employer is not obliged to pay any further premiums in respect of previously accrued benefits.
This means that in case of insufficient funding, the benefits of participants could, in theory, be reduced.
The current solvency ratio is 111.7% December 2014.
The required solvency ratio according to Dutch law is 122.3% as at 31 December 2012.
Should a surplus appear within the scheme the board will decide if a reduction in premium is possible although this would only be possible at much higher solvency levels.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Premiums paid to the scheme by the group and charged to the income statement in 2014 totalled 7m 2013: 8m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2015 in respect of the on-going accrual of benefits is approximately 8m including allowance for members of the Securicor Staff Pension Plan who have now joined this multi-employer plan.
The premium that the IWPF received in 2014 is not yet available, in 2013 this amounted to 57.4m of which approximately 8m was paid by the group and 5m by G4S employees.
The total number of employees is approximately 22,500 at the end of 2013.
The number of employees working for the group is approximately 5,000 as at 31 October 2014.
The scheme is not accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits as it is not possible to identify the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result, and in line with general practice for such schemes, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme under IAS 19.
During 2014 the assets and past and future service liabilities of the Netherlands Securicor Staff Pension Plan were transferred to the Security Industry Wide Fund.
This led to a settlement gain of 26m 21m.
Defined benefit arrangements The group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the groups primary scheme is in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands and other less material plans elsewhere.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in relation to the material funded schemes are included within the following categories: 2014 2013 m m Amounts recognised in the income statement: Cost of sales 8 5 Administration expenses 2 2 Specific items 21 Net finance costs 20 20 Total for material funded defined benefit schemes 9 27 There are also various less material unfunded arrangements, for these the group does not hold related assets separate from the group.
In aggregate, other unfunded arrangements incurred 1m of cost of sales, 2m finance costs and included a 5m actuarial loss recognised in other comprehensive income.
During the year, the unfunded severance scheme liability of 13m in Saudi Arabia was re-classified from employee benefits provisions into retirement benefits obligation.

It comprises three sections: the Group 4 section which is the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S, the Securicor section, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, and the GSL section, responsibility for which the group assumed on 12 May 2008 with the acquisition of GSL.
The UK scheme is closed to future accrual apart from some sub-sections of the GSL section, and for most members defines the pension based on final salary.
The GSL section has historically remained open to provide a facility to accept former public-sector employees who join G4S through outsourcings.
In the Group 4 and Securicor sections, members retain their link to final salary where appropriate on their benefits accrued up to closure in 2011.
As at the latest actuarial funding valuation, the participants of the UK pension scheme sections can be analysed as follows: Group 4 GSL Securicor At 5 April 2012 section section section Total Active participants Number 808 808 Average age 47.1 47.1 Deferred participants Number 4,390 1,318 9,973 15,681 Average age 51.5 50.0 51.3 51.2 Pensioner participants Number 3,024 581 8,891 12,496 Average age 69.9 63.6 71.2 70.5 There is a mix of fixed and inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and the section of the scheme.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections are respectively 18 years Group 4 section, 20 years GSL section and 19 years Securicor section.
As at 31 December 2013 the discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the sections were 17 years Group 4 section, 18 years GSL section and 18 years Securicor section.
The scheme is set up under UK law and governed by a Trustee company which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
The Board of the Trustee Company is comprised of an independent chairman and further independent, group and scheme membership representatives.
The current schedule of deficit recovery contributions provides for a contribution of approximately 44m during 2015.
In addition, the company has pledged a share of any material disposal proceeds to the pension scheme to be shared in the same proportion as the pension scheme deficit bears to overall group indebtedness and has agreed that additional contributions would be made in the event that the average annual dividend payment to ordinary shareholders over the three financial years 2014, 2015, 2016 exceeds a certain threshold or in the event that the company makes a significant special dividend payment or equivalent capital return, to its ordinary shareholders over the same period.
A funding valuation is carried out for the schemes Trustee every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated: the group has guaranteed any contributions due from its subsidiaries.
The next valuation will have an effective date of 5 April 2015.
Other material Defined Benefit Schemes Apart from the multi-employer scheme referred to above, the group operated two material pension schemes in the Netherlands which apply to different employee populations: they are known as the Securicor Staff and Cash Solutions schemes.
Both schemes define pensions in terms of average career pay, are open to new entrants and are funded in accordance with Dutch requirements.
Pension increases in the Securicor Staff scheme are conditional on the funding level and so are only required if there is a funding surplus.
The Securicor scheme has a risk sharing arrangement whereby members pay 50% of the cost of the scheme but the group has opted to record 100% of the deficit as a company liability due to uncertainties as to the practicalities of applying the schemes provisions in this respect: for example in 2012 benefits were reduced rather than increasing members contributions.
The Cash Solutions scheme is required to provide benefits at least equivalent to the industry-wide multi-employer scheme, and in particular pension increases in payment and deferment, as well as revaluation of active members rights in the Cash Solutions scheme have to follow the multi-employer scheme which also applies a conditional approach.
The Cash Solutions scheme is insured, so longevity risk on the base level of insured pension that is before increases is carried by the insurer and any bonuses from the insurers returns may defray the cost of pension increases.
Accordingly, there is a counterparty risk against the insurer.

Retirement benefit obligations continued During the year the plan was amended to decrease the annual accrual rate from 2.00% to 1.87% for future service benefits.
This resulted in a past service credit of 1m that has been recognised as a specific item in the groups consolidated income statement.
The discounted weighted average duration of the accrued liabilities of the Cash Solutions scheme is 31 years 2013: 28 years.
In 2013 the group had a material scheme in Canada.
The sponsoring business sold on 17 January 2014 and the entire liabilities and assets of the scheme are now the responsibility of the purchaser.
Expected contributions The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the material schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2015 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits should be approximately 6m split 5m UK, 1m Netherlands and it is anticipated that these will remain at a similar level in the medium term subject to changes in financial conditions.
Principal risks The groups pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension plans.
For the UK funding valuation those assumed investment returns for funding valuations are set based on fixed margins over the LIBOR swap curve.
The management of the pension fund assets has been delegated to an asset manager which manages the assets against a liability benchmark.
The key parameters of this mandate can be summarised as follows: An asset mix which is managed dynamically over time rather than a set strategic allocation Interest rate and inflation risk is managed with the benchmark of hedging 100% of these risks as a percentage of the asset value through the use of debt instruments government bonds and derivatives Currency risk is managed with the objective of hedging at least 70% of the overseas currency exposure in the portfolio through the use of forward foreign currency contracts All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact G4S pension schemes.
Regarding financial reporting measures, the IAS 19 liability measurement DBO and the service cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being about future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and service cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of liabilities.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be volatile.
Assumptions and sensitivities The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Netherlands Key assumptions used at 31 December 2014 Discount rate 3.7% 2.3% Expected rate of salary increases 3.1% 1.8% Pension increases in payment for the UK, at RPI with a limit of 5% p. a.
2.8% 1.1% Inflation 3.0% 1.8% Key assumptions used at 31 December 2013 Discount rate 4.4% 3.7% Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 2.0% Pension increases in payment for the UK, at RPI with a limit of 5% p. a.
3.2% 1.4% Inflation 3.4% 2.0% The CPI assumption used for the UK valuation in 2014 was 2%.
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high-quality corporate bond rates.
The group considers that it is appropriate to consider AA-rated corporate bonds as high quality and therefore have used discount rates based on yields on such bonds corresponding to the liability profile of the schemes.
144 144 G4S plc G4S plc Ann Annual Repor ual Report and t and Accounts 2014 Accounts 2014 Financial statements Assumptions and sensitivities continued The effect of a movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately the amounts shown in the table below: Increase decrease in the Increase decrease in the DBO of the UK Scheme DBO of the UK Scheme 2014 2013 Sensitivity analysis m m Discount rate assumption being 0.5% higher 186 163 Discount rate assumption being 0.5% lower 211 181 The effect of a movement in RPI inflation applicable in the UK alters reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately the amounts shown in the table below: Increase decrease in the Increase decrease in the DBO of the UK Scheme DBO of the UK Scheme 2014 2013 Sensitivity analysis m m Inflation assumption being 0.5% higher 87 79 Inflation assumption being 0.5% lower 80 70 The above sensitivities allow for inflation-dependent assumptions such as salary growth and relevant pension increases to vary corresponding to the inflation assumption variation.
Due to the caps and floors on pension increases a certain movement in the inflation assumption will not generally result in the same movement in the pension increase assumption.
In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes obligations.
The mortality tables used for the scheme in the UK are: Birth year table S1P[M F]A Base with future improvements in line with CMI 2013 Core projections, based on a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% p. a. and allowing for individual scaling factors based on the majority analysis carried out as part of the last funding valuation.
The resulting assumed life expectancy of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 65 is 22 years.
The assumed life expectancy at 65 of a male currently aged 52 is 23 years.
At those ages, the assumed life expectancy for a female member is between 2 and 3 years longer than for a male member.
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax adjustments by approximately 105m 2013: 88m.
The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the DBO to key assumptions should not be interpreted as the group expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.

The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the present value of the future benefit that employees have earned at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
During 2014 a liability of 13m relating to the severance scheme in Saudi Arabia was reclassified to retirement benefit obligations to more accurately reflect the substance of the scheme and to allow for IAS19 R accounting.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
In the year the group incurred restructuring costs of 29m within specific items relating to the group wide transformation and a further 4m associated with costs incurred in the normal course of business.
Claims provision Claims provisions represent any outstanding litigation claims against the group that are likely to lead to the outflow of funds in the future, including provisions within the captive insurance companies to cover where appropriate anticipated claims incurred as at the balance sheet date, based on actuarial assessments to calculate the liabilities.
Legal claims are recognised based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
In the year the group provided 21m in relation to claims on legacy acquisitions and disposals.
The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash solutions, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
In the year the group provided 19m in relation to these claims.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Contract provisions Contract provisions include provisions for onerous contracts including future liabilities for loss-making contracts, for all properties sub-let at a shortfall, for the cost of replacing assets where there is a present contractual requirement and for long-term idle, leased properties.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.
Contract provisions are based on the present value of future net cash outflows and includes 45m of provisions for legacy UK government contracts that were recorded in the year within specific items.
The group are continuing to work with the relevant customers to recover these potential losses.
On 12 March 2014 the group announced that it had reached agreement with the UK Ministry of Justice MoJ on a settlement in respect of claims arising in relation to Electronic Monitoring services provided between 2005 and 2013.
The agreement also concluded outstanding matters relating to two UK facilities management contracts.
The total settlement amount was 109m and is included in utilisation of provisions, having been provided for as at 31 December 2013.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business, none of which are individually or collectively significant.

A deferred tax asset of 41m 2013: 30m has been recognised in respect of approximately 166m 2013: 120m of gross losses based on profitability from approved budgets and business plans.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 605m 2013: 585m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses of 19m which will expire between 2015 and 2024.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2014, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1,102m 2013: 1,220m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2014, the group had total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately 53m 2013: 58m relating to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions.

Share based payments In June 2014 a new long-term incentive plan replaced the previous performance share plan the performance share plans, as detailed in the Directors remuneration report from page 70.
Shares allocated conditionally fall under either the groups performance share plans or the groups performance-related bonus scheme.
Shares allocated conditionally under the performance-related bonus scheme vest three years following the date of grant provided certain non-market performance conditions are met.
Those allocated under the groups performance share plans vest after three years, to the extent that a certain non-market performance conditions are met and b certain market performance conditions are met.
The proportion of the allocation of awards to these criteria is described in the remuneration report.
Vesting occurs on the third anniversary of the date the shares were allocated conditionally.
The weighted average share price at the date of allocation of shares allocated conditionally during the year was 240.3p 2013: 291.7p and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was three years.
Under the groups performance share plans, the vesting of 30% 2013: 50% of the shares allocated conditionally depends upon Total Shareholder Return a market performance condition over the vesting year measured against a comparator group.
25% of the allocation vests upon the groups Total Shareholder Return equalling median performance amongst the comparator group.
The fair value of the shares allocated subject to this market performance condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
The income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of shares conditionally awarded subject to non-market performance conditions.
