NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements of Bunzl plc the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In accordance with the exemption allowed by paragraph 5 a of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, a cash flow statement has not been provided for the Company.
The Financial Reporting Council FRC has published four standards which together form the basis of the new financial reporting framework in the UK.
Subject to shareholders notification, with effect from 1 January 2015, the Company has applied the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS with disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provisions for impairment.
b Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
c Share based payments The Company operates equity settled share based compensation plans for which the total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date, calculated using a valuation model, and is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of options that are expected to vest.
Details of the relevant plans are outlined in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries these awards are accounted for by the Company as an additional investment in the relevant subsidiary equivalent to the equity settled share based payment charge recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit recognised directly in equity.
Any payment made by the subsidiaries in respect of these arrangements is treated as a return of this investment.
These costs are determined in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
d Tangible fixed assets All tangible fixed assets are included at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation.
The profit or loss on sale of tangible fixed assets is calculated by reference to the carrying values of the assets.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
e Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
This is applied at the following annual rates: Buildings 2% or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10%33% The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
f Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land.
114 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED g Tax The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
h Retirement benefit obligations The Company participates in a Group UK defined benefit scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the Company treats contributions to the defined benefit scheme as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the exemptions permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
As a result the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the relevant accounting period.
i Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
j Dividends The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
