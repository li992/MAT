They are included within the 'Investments held at fair value' on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as they are no longer consolidated on a line by line basis.
The Group results incorporate the Company and ATSL only, as it acts as a paymaster company and employer for all entities within the corporate structure and as such provides services that relate directly to the investment activities of the Company, however it is not an investment entity itself.
