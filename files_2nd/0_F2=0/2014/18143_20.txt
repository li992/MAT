NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2014 1 GENERAL INFORMATION CLS Holdings plc the Company and its subsidiaries together CLS Holdings or the Group is an investment property group which is principally involved in the investment, management and development of commercial properties, and in other investments.
The Groups principal operations are carried out in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden.
The Company is registered in the UK, registration number 2714781, with its registered address at 86 Bondway, London, SW8 1SF.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these group financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 38 and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations, and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
New standards and interpretations In the current year, the Group has adopted one standard for the first time, which has not had a material effect on the results for the year: Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities Amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable amounts disclosures for non-financial assets Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting IFRIC 21 Levies At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective.
In some cases these standards and guidance have not been endorsed by the European Union: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 11 amendments Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations IAS 16 and IAS 38 amendments Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation IAS 16 and IAS 41 amendments Agriculture: Bearer Plants IAS 19 amendments Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions IAS 27 amendments Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010-2012 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011-2013 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle These pronouncements, when applied, either will result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, apart from IFRS 9.
It is not practical to provide an estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 until the standard is effective.
2.2 Business Combinations i Subsidiary undertakings Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity or business to benefit from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the date control ceases.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are not subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
iii Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
64 Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2.3 Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date, and differences arising on translation are recognised in profit before tax.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities classified as available-for-sale and denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit before tax where the translation difference results from changes in the amortised cost of the security, and are recognised in equity where it results from other changes in the carrying amount of the security.
ii Consolidation of foreign entities The results and financial position of all Group entities which have a functional currency different from sterling are translated into sterling as follows: a assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: b income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the average exchange rates: and c all resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the cumulative translation reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the cumulative translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised as part of the gain or loss on sale in profit before tax.
2.4 Investment properties Investment properties are those properties held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
Additions to investment properties comprise costs of a capital nature: in the case of investment properties under development, these include capitalised interest and certain staff costs directly attributable to the management of the development.
Capitalised interest is calculated at the rate on associated borrowings applied to direct expenditure between the date of gaining planning consent and the date of practical completion.
The acquisition of an investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the Group, typically on unconditional exchange of contracts or when legal title passes.
Investment properties are carried at fair value, based on market value as determined by professional external valuers at the balance sheet date.
Investment properties being redeveloped for continuing use as investment properties, or for which the market has become less active, continue to be classified as investment properties and measured at fair value.
Changes in fair values are recognised in profit before tax.
2.5 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost less estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives, as follows: Plant and equipment 4 5 years Freehold property 6 years Hotel 20 years Holiday cottages and cabins 20 30 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit before tax.
65 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 December 2014 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.6 Financial instruments i Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including swaps and interest rate caps, to help manage its interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in profit before tax, except for derivatives which qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the gains and losses relating to which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
ii Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are initially measured at cost, and are subsequently revalued to fair value.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets.
On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through profit before tax.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the receivable in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, which equates to fair value.
v Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in profit before tax over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
2.7 Revenue i Rental income Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The cost of incentives is recognised over the lease term, on a straight-line basis, as a reduction of rental income.
ii Service charge income Service charge income is recognised on a gross basis in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
2.8 Profit on sale of investment properties Profit on sale of an investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, typically on unconditional exchange of contracts or when legal title passes.
2.9 Income tax Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the values used for tax purposes.
Temporary differences are not provided for when they arise from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect accounting or taxable profit.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, and is calculated using rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, in the tax jurisdiction in which the temporary differences arise.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in arriving at profit after tax, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
66 Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical estimates and judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
i Fair value of investment properties The Group uses the valuations performed by its independent external valuers as the fair value of its investment properties.
The valuations are based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and an appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
ii Listed corporate bonds The best evidence of the fair value of listed corporate bonds is quoted prices in an active market.
The bond market is not always as liquid as conventional equity markets.
The Group, therefore, is required to make certain judgements when arriving at the fair value of bonds which are less liquid in nature.
To the extent that bond prices are not available from third party pricing sources the Group determines their fair value by comparing observable market data and making judgements on the liquidity of particular bonds from a variety of sources: a the Group uses a broker to obtain multiple quotes directly from market makers and to make a judgement as to the liquidity of those bonds, and the Group determines whether the judgments of liquidity are reasonable and whether the spread of market maker prices is within an expected range: and b the Group makes judgements on price and liquidity based on recent market transactions in particular bonds.
iii Income Taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in different jurisdictions and estimation is required to determine the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which determination is made.
67 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 December 2014 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group has two operating divisions Investment Property and Other Investments.
Other Investments comprise corporate bonds, shares in Catena AB, Bulgarian Land Development Plc, First Camp Sverige Holding AB and Cood Investments AB, and other small corporate investments.

11 EARNINGS PER SHARE Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA measure of earnings per share which has been provided to give relevant information to investors on the long-term performance of the Groups underlying property investment business.
The EPRA measure excludes items which are non-recurring in nature such as profits net of related tax on sale of investment properties and of other non-current investments, and items which have no impact to earnings over their life, such as the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and the net movement on revaluation of investment properties, and the related deferred taxation on these items.

12 NET ASSETS PER SHARE Management has chosen to disclose the two European Public Real Estate Association EPRA measures of net assets per share: EPRA net assets per share and EPRA triple net assets per share.
The EPRA net assets per share measure highlights the fair value of equity on a long-term basis, and so excludes items which have no impact on the Group in the long term, such as fair value movements of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax on the fair value of investment properties.
The EPRA triple net assets per share measure discloses net assets per share on a true fair value basis: all balance sheet items are included at their fair value in arriving at this measure, including deferred tax, fixed rate loan liabilities and any other balance sheet items not reported at fair value.

Valuations were based on current prices in an active market for all properties.
The property valuations were carried out by external, professionally qualified valuers as follows: London: DTZ: Knight Frank 2013: Lambert Smith Hampton: Knight Frank Rest of UK: DTZ 2013: Savills France: Jones Lang LaSalle Germany: Colliers International Sweden: CB Richard Ellis Property valuations are complex and require a degree of judgements and are based on data which is not publicly available.
Consistent with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
In addition to note 3 i, inputs into the valuations include equivalent yields and rental income and are described as unobservable as per IFRS 13.
These inputs are analysed by segment in the property portfolio information on page 28.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst an increase in equivalent nominal yield would result in a fall in value and vice versa.
Investment properties included leasehold properties with a carrying amount of 49.6 million 2013: 57.4 million.
Interest capitalised within capital expenditure in the year amounted to 2.9 million 2013: 0.9 million.
Where the Group leases out its investment property under operating leases the duration is typically three years or more.
No contingent rents have been recognised in either the current or the comparative year.
Substantially all investment properties and the owner-occupied property detailed in note 14 are secured against debt.
In 2010 the Group purchased a property in London for 1.8 million.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, should the site be developed additional consideration may become due to the vendor.

Impairment review 2014 and 2013 Goodwill was reviewed for impairment at 31 December 2014 and at 31 December 2013 using the key assumptions set out below.
No adjustment for impairment was required.
Key assumptions: Unamortised goodwill at 31 December 2014 and at 31 December 2013 related to contingent deferred tax arising on acquisitions of corporate entities for which an equal deferred tax liability was recognised in the balance sheet.
Management have reviewed the sensitivity to a fall in property values of each cash-generating unit.
A fall of 10% would result in a potential impairment of goodwill of up to 0.1 million 2013: 0.1 million.

The average period to maturity of these interest rate swaps was 4.1 years 2013: 4.2 years.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to add certainty to, and to minimise the impact of foreign exchange movements on, committed cash flows.

24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Categories of financial instruments Financial assets of the Group comprise: interest rate caps: foreign currency forward contracts: available-for-sale investments: investments in associates: trade and other receivables: and cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities of the Group comprise: interest rate swaps: forward foreign currency contracts: bank loans: debenture loans: zero coupon notes: unsecured bonds: secured notes: trade and other payables: and current tax liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: a Interest rate swaps and caps are measured at the present value of future cash flows based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
b Foreign currency options and forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
c The fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
Financial assets in this category include available-for-sale instruments such as listed corporate bonds and equity investments.
d In more illiquid conditions, non-derivative financial assets are valued using multiple quotes obtained from market makers and from pricing specialists.
Where the spread of prices is tightly clustered the consensus price is deemed to be fair value.
Where prices become more dispersed or there is a lack of available quoted data, further procedures are undertaken such as evidence from the last non-forced trade.
e The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis, using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
Except for investments in associates and fixed rate loans, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair value.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balances.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, other investments and equity attributable to the owners of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Management perform stress tests of the Groups business model to ensure that the Groups objectives can be met.
The objectives have been met in the year.
The Directors review the capital structure on a quarterly basis to ensure that key strategic goals are being achieved.
As part of this review they consider the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.

Externally imposed capital requirement At 31 December 2014 the Group was subject to a minimum equity ratio of total equity to total assets of 22.5% imposed by unsecured bonds of 88.8 million 2013: 91.7 million.
The Group was also restricted from making distributions to shareholders if to do so would reduce net assets below 250 million, imposed by unsecured bonds of 64.3 million 2013: 64.2 million.
Additionally, the Group was subject to externally imposed capital requirements to the extent that debt covenants may require group companies to maintain ratios such as debt to equity or similar below certain levels.
Risk management objectives The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which can be grouped as: market risk credit risk liquidity risk The Groups overall risk management approach seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance whilst maintaining flexibility.
Risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury department in close co-operation with the Groups operating units and with guidance from the Board of Directors.
The Board regularly assesses and reviews the financial risks and exposures of the Group.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent other price risk.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk and also uses natural hedging strategies such as matching the duration, interest payments and currency of assets and liabilities.
i Interest rate risk The Groups most significant interest rate risk arises from its long-term variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored by the treasury department and by the Board on both a country and a Group basis.
The Boards policy is to mitigate variable interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to borrow at the best rates and with consideration to potential penalties on termination of fixed rate loans.
To manage its exposure the Group uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and natural hedging from cash held on deposit.
In assessing risk, a range of scenarios is taken into consideration such as refinancing, renewal of existing positions and alternative financing and hedging.
Under these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement for a defined movement in the underlying interest rate.
The impact of a reasonably likely movement in interest rates is set out below: 2014 2013 Income Income statement statement Scenario m m Cash 50 basis points 0.3 0.3 Variable borrowings including caps 50 basis points 2.5 2.6 Cash -50 basis points 0.3 0.3 Variable borrowings including caps -50 basis points 1.8 1.9 86 Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts ii Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign exchange exposure.
However, it has operations in Europe which transact business denominated in euros and, to a lesser extent, in Swedish kronor.
Consequently, there is currency exposure caused by translating into sterling the local trading performance and net assets for each financial period and balance sheet, respectively.
The policy of the Group is to match the currency of investments with the related borrowing, which largely eliminates foreign exchange risk on property investments.
A portion of the remaining operations, equating to the net assets of the foreign property operations, is not hedged except in exceptional circumstances, such as the uncertainty surrounding the euro in late 2011.
Where foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, the Group will hedge the future committed commercial transaction using foreign exchange swaps or forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups principal currency exposures are in respect of the euro and the Swedish krona.
If the value of sterling were to increase or decrease in strength the Groups net assets and profit for the year would be affected.
The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in the strength of sterling against these currencies is set out below: 2014 2014 2013 2013 Profit Profit Net assets before tax Net assets before tax Scenario m m m m 1% increase in value of sterling against the euro 1.4 1.4 1.2 0.1 1% increase in value of sterling against the Swedish krona 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.2 1% fall in value of sterling against the euro 0.2 0.2 1.3 0.1 1% fall in value of sterling against the Swedish krona 0.4 0.2 iii Other price risk The Group is exposed to corporate bond price risk and, to a lesser extent, to equity securities price risk, because of investments held by the Group and classified in the balance sheet as available-for-sale.
In order to manage the risk in relation to the holdings of corporate bonds and equity securities the Group holds a diversified portfolio.
Diversification of the portfolio is managed in accordance with the limits set by the Group.
The table below shows the effect on other comprehensive income which would result from an increase or decrease of 10% in the market value of corporate bonds and equity securities, which is an amount management believes to be reasonable in the current market: 2014 2013 Other Other Comprehensive Comprehensive Income Income Scenario: Shift of 10% in valuations m m 10% fall in value 10.0 10.4 10% increase in value 10.0 10.4 b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Credit risk arises from the ability of customers to meet outstanding receivables and future lease commitments, and from financial institutions with which the Group places cash and cash equivalents, and enters into derivative financial instruments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is partly represented by the carrying amounts of the financial assets which are carried in the balance sheet, including derivatives with positive fair values.
For credit exposure other than to occupiers, the Directors believe that counterparty risk is minimised to the fullest extent possible as the Group has policies which limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are made with customers with an appropriate credit history.
Credit risk to customers is assessed by a process of internal and external credit review, and is reduced by obtaining bank guarantees from the customer or its parent, and rental deposits.
The overall credit risk in relation to customers is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Moreover, a significant proportion of the Group portfolio is let to Government occupiers which can be considered financially secure.
87 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 December 2014 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED At 31 December 2014 the Group held 99.9 million 2013: 104.3 million of available-for-sale financial assets.
Management considers the credit risk associated with individual transactions and monitors the risk on a continuing basis.
Information is gathered from external credit rating agencies and other market sources to allow management to react to any perceived change in the underlying credit risk of the instruments in which the Group invests.
This allows the Group to minimise its credit exposure to such items and at the same time to maximise returns for shareholders.
The table below shows the external Standard & Poors credit banding on the available-for-sale financial investments held by the Group: 2014 2013 S&P Credit rating at balance sheet date m m Investment grade 5.8 3.8 Non-investment grade 50.7 56.6 Not rated 43.4 43.9 Total 99.9 104.3 c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk management requires maintaining sufficient cash, other liquid assets and the availability of funding to meet short, medium and long-term requirements.
The Group maintains adequate levels of liquid assets to fund operations and to allow the Group to react quickly to potential opportunities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity on the basis of expected cash flows so that future requirements can be managed effectively.
The majority of the Groups debt is arranged on an asset-specific, non-recourse basis.
This allows the Group a higher degree of flexibility in dealing with potential covenant defaults than if the debt was arranged under a Group-wide borrowing facility.
Loan covenant compliance is closely monitored by the treasury department.
Potential covenant breaches can ordinarily be avoided by placing additional security or a cash deposit with the lender, or by partial repayment to cure an event of default.
The table below analyses the Groups contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining to the contractual maturity date.
Amounts due within one year are equivalent to the carrying values in the balance sheet as the impact of discounting is not significant.
