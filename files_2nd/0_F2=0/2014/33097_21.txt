118 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 118 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3: Segmental analysis The factors used to determine the Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations, UK and France, and sectors in which it operates, which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated.
Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from its customers, or tenants.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.
As stated in the Financial Review on page 51, management reviews the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basis, except for its interests in premium outlets held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, where the Group has less day-to-day involvement in the financial performance and which have different operational characteristics compared with the Groups property portfolio.
The segmental analysis has been prepared on the basis that management uses to review the business, rather than on a statutory basis.

The Scheme, was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2002, and was closed to future accrual for all participating employees on 30 June 2014, which led to a curtailment gain of 2.5 million.
Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Scheme The unfunded scheme provides pension benefits to two former Executive Directors: one in the UK and one in France.
The amount of pension is linked to final salary at retirement.
The accrued benefits in respect of the former Executive Directors remain within the scheme and are now paid directly by the Group.

Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2014 the total of such gains was 250 million 2013: 235 million and the potential tax effect before the offset of losses was 50 million 2013: 47 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
There were no such properties at 31 December 2013 or 2014.
E: UK REIT status The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years after completion of development.
The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Groups exempted net income.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activity and its balance of business.
The Group continues to meet these conditions.
com 125 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 8: Tax continued F: French SIIC status Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which then designates UK dividends paid to its shareholders as SIIC distributions.
Dividend obligations will arise principally after property disposals but for the Hammerson Group there will be a period of around four years after a disposal for dividends to be paid to shareholders.
Outstanding SIIC dividend obligations arising on disposals and earnings prior to 31 December 2014 amount to 26 million 2013: 30 million and are expected to be settled within dividends paid by Hammerson plc over the following four years.
A further 400 million 2013: 300 million of dividends would be payable if the properties were realised at their 31 December 2014 values.
Since 1 July 2009, qualifying foreign dividends have been exempt from UK tax and therefore no deferred tax provision is recognised.
To remain a SIIC, at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment and, with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of the shares.
9: Discontinued operations As part of the Groups strategy to focus on the retail sector, a number of office properties, and related entities, were disposed of between July 2012 and June 2013.
The income and expenditure was classified as discontinued operations in 2012 and 2013, and the summarised income statement for 2013 allocated between Adjusted and Capital and other for the purposes of calculating figures in accordance with EPRA best practice is shown below.

2.0 pence per share will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax at the basic rate currently 20% if applicable, and the remainder of 9.6 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend.
There will be no scrip alternative.
The aggregate amount of the 2014 final dividend is 91.0 million.
This has been calculated using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2014.
The interim dividend of 8.8 pence per share was paid on 2 October 2014, as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate.

com 129 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 12: Investment and development properties continued Properties are stated at fair value as at 31 December 2014, valued by professionally qualified external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, Chartered Surveyors.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 based on certain assumptions as set out in note 1.
In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders.
To comply with IAS 40 and IAS 17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within Obligations under finance leases note 21 and Interests in leasehold properties respectively.
Further information is provided in Significant accounting policies on page 115.
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website: www.
As noted in Significant judgements and key estimates on page 114, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely publicly available and involve a degree of judgement.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs to the valuations, some of which are unobservable as defined by IFRS 13, include nominal equivalent yield and rental income.
These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the valuation and rental data tables on pages 158 and 162.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in nominal equivalent yield and discount rate would result in a fall in values and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the impact on valuation.
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions.
For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.
The total amount of interest included in development properties at 31 December 2014 was 2.4 million 2013: 24.6 million.
Capitalised interest is calculated using the cost of secured debt or the Groups average cost of borrowings, as appropriate, and the effective rate applied in 2014 was 4.7% 2013: 4.8%.
At 31 December 2014 the historic cost of investment and development properties was 3,930.1 million 2013: 3,124.7 million.

The interest rates shown are the weighted average for fixed rate borrowings.
Variable rate borrowings bear interest based on LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR.
20: Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of these issues is set out in Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 55.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A: Debt management The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
B: Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had interest rate swaps of 250.0 million 2013: 250.0 million, maturing in 2020 under which the Group pays interest at a rate linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of 15.0 million 2013: 2.0 million asset.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C: Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
The Group also hedges the impact of foreign exchange movements in debt raised in foreign currencies through the use of derivatives to swap the cash flows back to either sterling or euros.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro-denominated bonds and currency swaps, as net investment hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2014 was 775.8 million 2013: 811.3 million and their fair value was 829.8 million 2013: 845.7 million.
Included in the senior notes USPP due in June 2021, 2024 and 2026 is a euro-denominated borrowings element of 60.0 million which had a carrying amount of 46.5 million.
com 141 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 20: Financial instruments and risk management continued At 31 December 2014, the Group had currency swaps of 987.3 million, being 121.0 million sold forward against sterling for value in January 2015 at a rate of 1 1.273, 412.0 million sold forward against sterling for value in March 2015 at a rate of 1 1.272, 379.6 million of cross currency swaps to swap the 300.0 million, 5.25% sterling bond maturing in 2016 into euro at a rate of 1 1.265 and a coupon of 4.76%, and cross currency swaps to swap US$291 million of Senior notes USPP maturing in June 2021 and 2024, into euro at a rate of 1 US$1.3415.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had currency swaps of 735.9 million, being 302.5 million sold forward against sterling for value in February 2014, at a rate of 1 1.184 and the 379.6 million and US$291 million of cross currency swaps as described above.
The fair value of currency swaps is shown in note 20I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity.
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 51 to 54.
E: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.
F: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2014 was 8.1 years 2013: 8.0 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Portfolio Analysis on page 161.
Loans receivable and other receivables include available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 15 and 16 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 16.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 205.7 million 2013: 165.6 million.
G: Financial maturity analysis The following table is a maturity analysis for income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities.

Where facilities are undrawn, unamortised fees appear in the analysis above as negative amounts in the period in which the facility matures.
H: Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The tables below provide indicative sensitivity data.
2014 2013 Increase in Decrease in Increase in Decrease in interest rates interest rates interest rates interest rates Effect on profit before tax: by 1% by 1% by 1% by 1% Decrease Increase m 17.2 17.9 18.4 19.1 There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
2014 2013 Strengthening of Weakening of Strengthening of Weakening of sterling against sterling against sterling against sterling against Effect on financial instruments: euro by 10% euro by 10% euro by 10% euro by 10% Increase Decrease in net gain taken to equity m 166.9 204.0 129.4 158.1 These effects would be more than offset by the effect of exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the Groups financial statements.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at the year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
