Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill continued 2013 597mmboe per year.
It is estimated that if production volume were to be reduced by approximately 5% for the whole period, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related non-current assets of the segment.
It is estimated that if the post-tax discount rate was approximately 10% for the entire portfolio this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related non-current assets of the segment.
Downstream $ million 2014 2013 Lubricants Other Total Lubricants Other Total Goodwill 3,264 704 3,968 3,518 759 4,277 Cash flows for each cash-generating unit are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of two to five years.
To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value.
Lubricants As permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of the Lubricants units recoverable amount performed in the most recent detailed calculation in 2013 were used for the 2014 impairment test as the criteria in that standard were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2013: there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities: and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount at the time was remote.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Lubricants unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate.
The values assigned to these key assumptions reflect past experience.
No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
Cash flows beyond the two-year plan period were extrapolated using a nominal 3% growth rate.
