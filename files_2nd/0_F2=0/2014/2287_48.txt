Other financial assets continued Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 17.2m 2013: 16.3m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 38 days, with a range from 14 days to 70 days.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2014 2013 m m 3160 days 10.4 10.1 6190 days 4.5 4.1 91120 days 1.1 1.5 Greater than 120 days 1.2 0.6 17.2 16.3 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 6.1 6.2 Impairment losses recognised 1.3 2.1 Amounts written off as uncollectable 0.5 0.6 Impairment losses reversed 1.2 1.6 Exchange differences 0.2 At 31 December 5.5 6.1 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of 8.3m 2013: 8.9m.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected proceeds.
