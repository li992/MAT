Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued In regard to the Ejido El Bajo matter previously reported by the Company: In 2009 five members of the El Bajo agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont Penmont, submitted a legal claim to the Unitarian Agrarian Court Tribunal Unitario Agrario of Hermosillo Sonora, tohave Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations ofSoledad-Dipolos is located.
The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares ofland.
The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos.
The Magistrate noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of theFederal Environmental Agency SEMARNAT in this respect.
The Agrarian Magistrate further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the same state that they were before Penmonts occupation.
In the opinion of the Company, the procedural order is excessive since such level of remediation was not considered as part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appears not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits.
Penmont has challenged the procedural order before Federal courts and is awaiting resolution of this filing.
Penmont conducted mining activities on approximately 300 hectares of such lands and the remediation activities in this respect are still pending.
In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajo agrarian community presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court, claiming US$65 million for damages, alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as requesting the cancellation of Penmonts mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajo lands.
Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land.
The claimants have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit.
Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora.
Given the lack of evidence insupport of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling is not probable.
In addition, claimants have also presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above.
Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont.
Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in this matter including appeals that are pending as well as criminal complaints.
There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings.
