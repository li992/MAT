FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND THEIR OBJECTIVES Credit and concentration of risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, without recourse discounts, and other allowances.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, customers in the MENA region are offered relatively long payment terms compared to customers in Europe and the US.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Groups largest three customers in the MENA region represented 8.6% of Group revenue: 5.8% from one customer in Saudi Arabia, and a combined 2.8% from two customers in Algeria.
At 31 December 2014, the amount of receivables due from customers based in Saudi Arabia was $110 million 2013: $100 million, and in Algeria was $46 million 2013: $74 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, three key US wholesalers represented 37% of Group revenue 2013: 33.3%.
Sales of the US reflect success in capturing specific market opportunities.
The amount of receivables due from US customers at 31 December 2014 was $75 million 2013: $76 million.
The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies, procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a particular customer.
The Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across the Group.
Typical credit terms in the US range from 3090 days, in Europe 30120 days and in MENA 180360 days.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Market risk The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
