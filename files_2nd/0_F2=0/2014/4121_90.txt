Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to members of the parent company of 43,207,000 2013: 36,139,000 as restated by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share amounts, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts was as per the table below: 2014 2013 Thousands Thousands Basic weighted average number of shares 48,734 48,257 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 191 137 48,925 48,394 Adjusted earnings per share During the year the Group released the contingent consideration liability in relation to the acquisition of Kingston Foods Limited note 14.
In addition, the Group made the Wayland and Wold Farms acquisitions described in note 14, and subsequently recognised a profit on the IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets acquired.
In the prior year the Group impaired freehold property, plant and equipment to their fair value at its mothballed production facility in East Lancashire.
The property has subsequently been demolished and the land is in the process of being sold.
As the release of contingent consideration and the impairment of property, plant and equipment do not form part of the ongoing business of the Group and due to the volatility of the valuation of biological assets the Directors consider it appropriate to present an adjusted measure of earnings per share on the face of the income statement which excludes the effects of these items to provide a more meaningful measure of the underlying performance of the business.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of shares for both basic and diluted amounts as detailed above.
Adjusted profit for the year is derived as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Restated Profit for the year 43,207 36,139 Impairment of property, plant and equipment - 1,836 Release of contingent consideration 1,086 - Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 1,441 - Tax on net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 288 - Adjusted profit for the year 40,968 37,975 Report & Accounts 2014 Cranswick plc 87
