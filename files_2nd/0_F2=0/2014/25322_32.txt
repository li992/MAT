Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders of 71.8 million 2013: 95.6 million by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 237.6 million 2013: 244.0 million which has been adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of shares held in treasury and by the employee trust.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of IPF plc ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary share options relating to employees of the Group.

Deferred tax has not been provided on unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries as it is considered that any future distribution will fall within the UKs dividend exemption, and hence no exposure to UK tax is expected to arise.

Amounts receivable from customers continued All lending is in the local currency of the country in which the loan is issued.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: 2014 2013 Group M M Polish zloty 293.3 310.0 Czech crown 100.3 114.4 Euro 51.9 55.6 Hungarian forint 109.5 112.5 Mexican peso 132.5 122.5 Romanian leu 68.4 69.0 Lithuanian litas 2.3 0.4 Bulgarian lev 2.3 0.4 760.5 784.8 Amounts receivable from customers are held at amortised cost and are equal to the expected future cash flows receivable discounted at the average EIR of 121% 2013: 126%.
All amounts receivable from customers are at fixed interest rates.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers is 5.6 months 2013: 5.8 months.
The Group has one class of loan receivable and no collateral is held in respect of any customer receivables.
The Group does not use an impairment provision account for recording impairment losses and, therefore, no analysis of gross customer receivables less provision for impairment is presented.
Revenue recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired was 458.6 million 2013: 421.7 million.
Management monitor credit quality using two key metrics: impairment as a percentage of revenue and gross cash loss GCL development.
Commentary on impairment as a percentage of revenue is set out in the operational review at both Group and market level.
GCL represents the expected total value of contractual cash flows that will not be collected and will ultimately be written off for any loan or group of loans.
Until collections on any group of receivables are complete, the GCL forecast is a composite of actual and expected cash flows.
This represents a leading edge measure of credit quality with forecasts based on the actual performance of previous lending.
At 31 December 2014 our preliminary GCL forecast for 2015 was 13.2%.
The outturn for 2013 lending as at 31 December 2014 was 14.3%.
The Company has no amounts receivable from customers.

Risks arising from financial instruments Risk management Treasury related risks The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority.
Treasury activities and compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risk: interest rate risk: currency risk: and counterparty risk.
This is to ensure that the Group is properly funded: that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits: and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality.
Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups underlying business operations.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options.
Liquidity risk The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth.
The short-term nature of the Groups business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months with an average period to maturity of less than six months.
The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low.
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress-testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis.
Further, the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates: that there is diversification of debt funding sources: that there is no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders: and that debt facilities and hedging capacity are sufficient for the currency requirements of each country.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups bonds and committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 4.1 years 2013: 2.5 years.
As shown in note 19, total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2014 were 171.8 million 2013: 175.3 million.
A maturity analysis of gross borrowings included in the balance sheet is presented in note 19.
A maturity analysis of bonds, bank borrowings and overdrafts outstanding at the balance sheet date by non-discounted contractual cash flow, including expected interest payments, is shown below: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 M M M M Not later than six months 53.1 29.3 13.4 20.9 Later than six months and not later than one year 48.5 21.8 47.0 16.3 Later than one year and not later than two years 38.2 275.1 36.4 217.4 Later than two years and not later than five years 122.8 62.2 109.8 56.1 Later than five years 353.6 109.9 353.6 109.9 616.2 498.3 560.2 420.6 The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken.
The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the balance sheet date.

A maturity analysis of the Groups receivables and borrowing facilities as at 31 December is presented below: Percentage Borrowing Percentage Receivables of total facilities of total Group M % M % 2013 Less than one year 739.1 94.2 45.3 7.9 Later than one year 45.7 5.8 530.5 92.1 784.8 100.0 575.8 100.0 2014 Less than one year 723.9 95.2 102.0 15.7 Later than one year 36.6 4.8 548.1 84.3 760.5 100.0 650.1 100.0 This demonstrates the short-term nature of the amounts receivable from customers which contrasts with the longer-term nature of the Groups committed funding facilities.
Amounts receivable from customers Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section within this note.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks to limit this net exposure.
This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest costs, including fixed rate funding, predominantly longer-term bond funding : forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding: bank borrowing loan draw-down periods: and interest rate hedging instruments.
These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time, up to seven years, although most hedging is for up to two years.
Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Groups revenue 5.8% in 2014: 6.6% in 2013 and therefore the risk of a material impact on profitability arising from a change in interest rates is low.
If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2014 2013 Group M M Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 0.3 0.7 Reduction in profit before taxation 0.2 0.4 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: the change in the market interest rate occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and or derivative financial instruments: where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates: and changes in market interest rate affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure: cash flow exposure: and income statement exposure.
Risks arising from financial instruments continued Net asset exposure The majority of the Groups net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The impact in 2014 is a decrease in net assets of 42.3 million 2013: decrease of 3.9 million.
The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables with borrowings in local currency, where possible.
Cash flow exposure The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Income statement exposure As with net assets, the majority of the Groups profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into sterling for reporting purposes.
The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate.
A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period.
The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equity of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates for the countries in which the Group operates: 2014 2013 Group M M Change in reserves 6.0 5.8 Change in profit before taxation 8.0 7.7 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: there is a 5% strengthening weakening of sterling against all currencies in which the Group operates Polish zloty, Lithuanian litas, Czech crown, euro, Hungarian forint, Mexican peso, Romanian leu and Bulgarian lev : and there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability.
Counterparty risk The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks: and foreign currency and derivative financial instruments.
The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institution.
Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with Board approval.
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets.
The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows: 2014 2013 Group M M Cash and cash equivalents 68.8 24.6 Derivative financial assets 5.8 6.5 Total 74.6 31.1 The table above represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to at the year end.
An analysis of the cash and cash equivalents by geographical segment is presented in note 16.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are neither past due nor impaired.
Credit quality of these assets is good and the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury policies, to ensure the risk of loss is minimised.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
Amounts receivable from customers The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which it operates.
Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
This risk is minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group lends only to those customers who we believe can afford the repayments.
The amount loaned to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the credit scoring process.
The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly basis by geographical segment.
These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if results differ from management expectations.
2014 2013 Group M M Amounts receivable from customers 760.5 784.8 The table above represents the maximum exposure to credit risk of the Group at the year end.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 15.
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate.
Amounts receivable from customers include 6.2 million that is past due but not impaired 2013: 7.2 million.
This is in relation to the first four weeks of loans for new customers, and allows a repayment pattern to be established.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical segment below: Not impaired Impaired 2014 2013 2014 2013 Group M M M M Poland-Lithuania 74.5 88.7 221.1 221.7 Czech-Slovakia 43.3 53.1 108.9 116.9 Hungary 38.3 40.3 71.2 72.2 Mexico 33.1 36.0 99.4 86.5 Romania-Bulgaria 21.9 26.0 48.8 43.4 211.1 244.1 549.4 540.7 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment.
The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will, therefore, be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.
Annualised impairment as a percentage of revenue for each geographical segment is shown below: 2014 2013 Group % % Poland-Lithuania 27.3 28.5 Czech-Slovakia 30.7 23.7 Hungary 20.4 18.9 Mexico 30.9 30.0 Romania-Bulgaria 31.1 28.3 The carrying value of amounts receivable from customers that would have been impaired had their terms not been renegotiated is nil 2013: nil.
Risks arising from financial instruments continued Capital risk The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business.
The Group is not required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on equity to its shareholders.
The Groups long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.
Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to receivables and the gearing ratio.
The equity of the Group and these ratios are shown below: 2014 2013 Group M M Receivables 760.5 784.8 Borrowings 478.3 400.5 Other net assets 79.4 9.6 Equity 361.6 393.9 Equity as % of receivables 47.5% 50.2% Gearing 1.3 1.0 Equity as a percentage of receivables was above the Groups internally-set target.
Gearing, which is equal to borrowings divided by equity, at a ratio of 1.3 times 2013: 1.0 times, is well within covenant limits of 3.75 times.
Derivative financial instruments Fair value estimation IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements of derivative financial instruments by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
Where fair values are disclosed for financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, all such assets are classed as level 1, with the exception of disclosures relating to amounts receivable from customers which are classed as level 3.
Details of the significant assumptions in relation to amounts receivable from customers are included in note 23 along with the fair value of other Group assets and liabilities.
All of the Groups financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
The Groups derivative assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value at 31 December are as follows: 2014 2013 Group M M Assets Foreign currency contracts 5.8 6.5 Total 5.8 6.5 2014 2013 Group M M Liabilities Interest rate swaps 0.5 Foreign currency contracts 2.7 3.2 Total 2.7 3.7 126 International Personal Finance plc International Personal Finance plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 126 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 continued continued 21.
Derivative financial instruments continued 2014 2013 Company M M Assets Foreign currency contracts 0.9 Total 0.9 2014 2013 Company M M Liabilities Foreign currency contracts 0.4 Total 0.4 The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses foreign currency contracts cash flow hedges to hedge those foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps cash flow hedges to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur within two years of the balance sheet date.
The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods.
An amount of 1.1 million has been credited to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges 2013: 0.5 million charged to equity, Company: 0.5 million credit 2013: 0.5 million charge.
Foreign currency contracts The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2014 is 373.8 million 2013: 281.9 million.
These comprise: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell operational currencies against the euro for a total notional amount of 242.4 million 2013: 205.4 million.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to December 2016 2013: June 2015.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell various currencies for a total notional amount of 0.3 million 2013: 0.4 million.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to October 2015 2013: November 2014.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: and foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of 131.1 million 2013: 76.1 million.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to November 2018 2013: November 2018.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2014 is 15.7 million 2013: 19.4 million.
These comprise: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell operational currencies against the euro for a total notional amount of 2.6 million 2013: 3.2 million.
All of these contracts are held with external providers to buy and sell currency and have equal and offsetting contracts with other Group companies to buy and sell the same amounts of currency.
This leaves the Company with no residual risk and ensures the relevant subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books: foreign currency contracts to buy or sell various currencies for a total notional amount of nil 2013: 2.3 million.
This leaves the Company with no residual risk and ensures the relevant subsidiary company has an effective foreign currency contract in its books: and foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of 13.1 million 2013: 13.9 million.
Interest rate swaps The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is 45.4 million 2013: 57.0 million.
In 2014, these interest rate swaps cover a proportion of current borrowings relating to the floating rate Polish bond and a proportion of floating rate bank borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS 39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve.
A charge of nil million 2013: 0.1 million has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and the income statement charge relating to the closure of interest rate swaps.
The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the Group interest rate swaps were as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Group % % Years % % Years Polish zloty 1.8 1.6 - 2.5 1.4 4.1 2.5 - 5.0 0.6 Mexican peso 5.0 5.0 1.2 The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: nil.

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value and carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are set out below: 2014 2013 Carrying Carrying Fair value value Fair value value Group M M M M Financial assets Amounts receivable from customers 1,078.3 760.5 1,079.7 784.8 Derivative financial instruments 5.8 5.8 6.5 6.5 Cash and cash equivalents 68.8 68.8 24.6 24.6 Other receivables 14.1 14.1 14.4 14.4 Current tax assets 1.6 1.6 1.3 1.3 1,168.6 850.8 1,126.5 831.6 Financial liabilities Bonds 452.1 462.4 401.9 371.1 Bank borrowings 15.9 15.9 29.4 29.4 Derivative financial instruments 2.7 2.7 3.7 3.7 Trade and other payables 95.3 95.3 102.8 102.8 Current tax liabilities 22.9 22.9 25.6 25.6 588.9 599.2 563.4 532.6 The fair value of amounts receivable from customers has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows as used to calculate the carrying value of amounts due from customers, net of agent collection costs, at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value.
The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value.
Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date.
The impact of discounting would therefore, be negligible.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes defined benefit With effect from 1 March 2010, the Groups defined benefit pension scheme was closed to further accrual of defined benefit obligations, with all members being offered the opportunity to join a money purchase scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at 31 December 2014.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2014 2013 Group and Company % % Price inflation CPI 2.2 2.6 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.0 3.3 Discount rate 3.7 4.6 The expected return on scheme assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
Different assumptions are used for different groups of members.
Most members have not yet retired.
On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 27 years.
On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 28 years.
If life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the defined benefit obligation would increase by approximately 1.2 million.
If the discount rate was 250 basis points higher lower, the defined benefit obligation would decrease by 2.4 million increase by 2.6 million.
If the price inflation rate was 250 basis points higher lower, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 1.4 million decrease by 1.4 million.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

All eligible UK employees are invited to join stakeholder pension schemes into which the Group contributes between 8% and 20% of members pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a minimum of 5%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The pension charge in the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the scheme and amounted to 1.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 2013: 1.1 million.
nil contributions were payable to the scheme at the year end 2013: nil.
In addition, an amount of 0.1 million 2013: 0.1 million has been charged to the income statement in respect of contributions into personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
Share-based payments The Group currently operates five categories of share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan : The International Personal Finance plc Approved Company Share Option Plan the CSOP : The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE scheme : The International Personal Finance plc Deferred Share Plan the Deferred Share Plan : and the International Personal Finance plc Have Your Share plan the HYS plan.
A number of awards have been granted under these schemes during the period under review.
All options granted under both the Performance Share Plans and CSOPs are subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance target and certain schemes granted in the Performance Share Plan and CSOP also include earnings per share EPS growth: net revenue growth: customer numbers growth: and agent turnover performance targets.
The income statement charge in respect of the Performance Share Plan and the CSOP has been calculated using both a Monte Carlo simulation for TSR and Black-Scholes model for the other non-market related conditions as these schemes include performance targets.
There are no performance conditions associated with the HYS plan: if an employee purchases a number of shares subject to a maximum, the Company grants a nil cost option over four times the number of shares initially purchased.
The only criterion associated with this option is that the employee must remain in employment for three years following the initial grant date.
The income statement charge in respect of this scheme is calculated using the share price at the date of grant.
The income statement charge in respect of the SAYE scheme is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, however, no TSR targets are assigned.
The Deferred Share Plan comprises of deferred awards with matching awards.
There are no additional performance criteria attached to the deferred awards, therefore, the income statement charge is calculated using the actual share price at the date the award is granted.
The matching awards are subject to the same criteria as the Performance Share Plan.
The total income statement charge in respect of these sharebased payments is 4.9 million 2013: 3.1 million.

Post balance sheet events continued Acquisition-related costs, included in administrative expenses in the Group consolidated income statement, amounted to 1.1 million.
The allocation of the consideration is subject to a full purchase price allocation exercise, which due to the timing of the acquisition has not yet been completed as at 25 February 2015 and, therefore, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete.
As a result, the Group is unable to disclose the following information regarding the acquisition: the gross contractual amount, fair value amount, or estimated contractual cash flows not expected to be collected from the receivables acquired: the amounts recognised as at the acquisition date for each major class of assets and liabilities acquired assumed: the existence of or the values relating to any contingent liabilities recognised upon acquisition: and the amount of goodwill acquired and the amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
This information will be detailed within the Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 2015.
Contingent liabilities The Groups Polish business received a notice from the Polish Office of Consumer Protection and Competition UOKiK in December 2013 stating that the way it calculates APRs amounts to a collective infringement of consumer interests and issued a fine of PLN 12.4 million 2.4 million.
UOKiK believes that the fee for the optional home service and an associated additional preparatory fee should be included in the total cost of credit and, therefore, the APR figure.
On the basis of legal advice received, the Group believes that it is calculating the total cost of credit and APR correctly and has appealed against the decision.
Consequently the Group has not made a provision in the Financial Statements for the cost of the fine because it does not believe it constitutes a probable cash outflow from the Group.
The Company has a contingent liability for guarantees given in respect of the borrowings of certain other Group companies to a maximum of 214.3 million 2013: 235.3 million.
At 31 December 2014, the fixed and floating rate borrowings under these facilities amounted to 52.1 million 2013: 68.7 million.
The directors do not expect any loss to arise.
These guarantees are defined as financial guarantees under IAS 39 and their fair value at 31 December 2014 was nil 2013: nil.
