GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED For the significant CGUs, the following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections: Foods Foods Foods The Asia Europe Americas AMET RUB Longer-term sustainable growth rates 0.5% 1.7% 3.1% Average near-term nominal growth rates 0.7% 5.4% 7.6% Average operating margins 1920% 2022% 1618% The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets.
The projections covered a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows.
The growth rates used are consistent with the prudent end of the range of assumptions from our annual planning and strategic planning processes.
We have performed sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the significant CGUs to be less than the carrying value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets.
Residual values are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows: Freehold buildings no depreciation on freehold land 40 years Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or life of lease if less Plant and equipment 2-20 years Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary.
If an indication of impairment exists, the assets or cash generating units recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.
