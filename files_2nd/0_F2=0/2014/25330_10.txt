INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 60 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 1.
Basis of Preparation International Public Partnerships Limited is a closed ended authorised investment company incorporated in Guernsey under Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The address of the registered office is given on page 85.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in pages 4 and 10 to 13 respectively.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group parent and consolidated subsidiary entities operates and represents the functional currency of the Parent and all values are rounded to the nearest 000, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, adopted by the European Union: interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee: applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey: and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The financial statements follow the historical cost basis, except for financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives that have been measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in relevant notes to the financial statements.
The Directors have determined that International Public Partnerships Limited is an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10 on the basis that: a it obtains funds from one or more investor s for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services: b it commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c it measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Accordingly, these financial statements consolidate only those subsidiaries that provide services relevant to its investment activities, such as management services, strategic advice and financial support to its investees.
Subsidiaries that do not provide investment-related services are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Going concern As set out in the Directors Report, the Directors have reviewed cash flow forecasts prepared by management.
Based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Group's committed banking facilities, they have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 29.4 million as at 31 December 2014.
The Group has access to an undrawn corporate debt facility balance of 158.1 million, which is available for investment in new and existing projects and is committed until December 2016.
The Group can utilise a portion of the undrawn corporate debt facility for working capital purposes.
The new facility is forecast to continue in full compliance with the associated banking covenants.
The Group also continues to fully cover cost and distributions from underlying operational investment cash flows.
During the year, the Group completed a tap issuance of 95 million which was used to partly repay the drawn down balance of the corporate debt facility.
There was also a scrip issuance as disclosed in note 17.
Accounting Policies The annual financial statements of International Public Partnerships Limited are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation are followed in this set of annual financial statements as applied in the previous financial year.
The new and revised IFRS and interpretations becoming effective in the period have had no impact on the accounting policies of the Group.
Note 22 sets out a comprehensive listing of all new standards applicable from 1 January 2014.
Significant Judgements and Estimates Service entities and consolidation group Following the adoption of IFRS 10 Investment Entity Amendments, the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and service entities controlled by the Company up to 31 December 2014, that themselves do not meet the definition of an investment entity.
Typically a service entity provides management services, strategic advice and financial support to investee entities.
Judgement is therefore required in assessing which entities meet these definitional requirements.
The Directors have reviewed and assessed the criteria applied in the assessment of services entities based on the guidance in place as at 31 December 2014 and are satisfied with the resulting conclusion.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Judgments and Estimates continued Fair valuation of investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at a rate appropriate to the risk profile of each investment.
In determining the discount rate relevant long-term government bond yields, specific investment risks and the evidence of recent transactions are considered.
Details of the valuation process and key sensitivities are provided in note 13.
Segmental Reporting Based on a review of information provided to the chief operating decision makers of International Public Partnerships Limited, the Group has identified four reportable segments based on the geographical risk associated with the Group.
The factors used to identify the Groups reportable segments are centered on the risk free rates and the maturity of the Infrastructure sector particularly PFI PPP within each region.
Further, foreign exchange and political risk is identified, as these also determine where resources are allocated.
Management has concluded that the Group is currently organised into four reportable segments being UK, Europe non UK, Australia and North America.
2 North American segment currently relates entirely to projects in Canada.
Revenue from investments which represents more than 10% of the Groups interest and dividend income approximates 17.0 million 2013: 18.04 million.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 62 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 4.
Investment Income Accounting policy Interest Income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
Interest income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses.
Dividend Income Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the date the right to receive payment is established.
This is the date when the directors of the underlying project entity approve the payment of a dividend.
Net Gain from Financial Instruments at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Net gain from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes including foreign exchange movements other than interest and dividend income recognised separately.

Gains on investments at fair value through profit or loss are also recognised on the Groups investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
Gain on Disposal of Investments During the year, the Group disposed of a number of non-strategic minority investments where there was no realistic scope to increase the investment in the future.
The divestments predominantly relate to a small number of minority interests in the Groups Building Schools for the Future BSF project portfolio.

Finance Costs Accounting policy Borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred using the effective interest rate method.
Arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the corporate borrowing facility.
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received net of any directly attributable issue costs.

On 20 October 2014, the Group made a drawdown of 110.6 million from the corporate debt facility in relation to the acquisition of TC Lincs OFTO Limited.
The Group repaid 94.3 million of the drawn balance on 29 November 2014, utilising proceeds of equity issued on 14 November 2014.
As at 31 December 2014, 16.3 million is payable under the corporate debt facility.
The interest rate margin on the corporate debt facility is 225 basis points over Libor.
The loan facility matures in December 2016 and is secured over the assets of the Group.
Tax Accounting policy Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups asset liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The current tax charge credit in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is recognised net of receivables recognised for losses surrendered to unconsolidated group subsidiary entities.
Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.

As a consequence of the adoption of IFRS10 investment entity consolidation exemption, underlying investment entity tax is not consolidated within these financial statements.
Total forecasted corporation tax payable by the Groups underlying investments is 759 million over their full concession lives.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 12.
Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000s 000s Earnings for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share being net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 73,211 58,634 Number Number Number of shares Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share 771,578,934 749,629,388 Basic and diluted 9.49 7.82 The denominator for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per share is the same, as the Group has not issued any share options or other instruments that would cause dilution.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when contractual provisions of the instrument are entered into.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Specific financial asset and liability accounting policies are provided below.
13.1 Financial assets 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000s 000s 1 Investments at fair value through profit and loss 1,032,941 844,382 Financial asset loans and receivables Trade and other receivables 19,529 13,020 Cash and cash equivalents 29,391 80,609 Derivative financial instruments Currency swaps 2,948 3,664 Total financial assets 1,084,809 941,675 1 Includes fair value of investments in associates amounting to 1.7 million 2013: 1.8 million.
Movements in the period represent additional fair value gains offset by net repayments from investments.
Accounting Policy The Group classifies its financial assets as at fair value through profit or loss or as loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, with investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries other than those providing investmentrelated services being designated at fair value through profit and loss as required by IFRS 10.
Investments at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Investments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiaries are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in PPP assets together.
All transaction costs relating to the acquisition of new investments are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, equity and debt investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised within operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial Assets Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instruments, but does not consider future credit losses.
Financial assets with maturities less than 12 months are included in current assets, financial assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 66 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 13.
Financial Instruments continued 13.1 Financial assets continued Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are offset only if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis.
Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments held for trading are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The method of recognising fair value gains or losses depends on whether derivatives are held for trading or are designated as hedging instruments, and if the latter, the nature of the risks being hedged.
Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets, other than those classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been adversely impacted.
13.2 Financial liabilities 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000s 000s Financial liabilities at amortised cost Trade and other payables excluding deferred income 6,414 6,284 Bank loans 16,327 - Total financial liabilities 22,741 6,284 Accounting Policy Trade and other payables Financial liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in respect of goods or services received up to the financial reporting date.
The cost of other liabilities is considered to approximate their fair value.
13.3 Financial risk and management objectives The Groups objective in managing risk is the creation and protection of shareholder value.
Risk is inherent in the Groups activities and is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
The process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability.
The Group is exposed to market risk which includes currency risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from the financial instruments it holds.
The Groups Investment Adviser is responsible for identifying and controlling risks.
The Board of Directors supervises the Investment Adviser and is ultimately responsible for the overall risk management of the Group.
The Groups risk management framework and approach is set out within the Strategic Report pages 34-38.
The Boards considerations of key risks impacting the business are set out within the Strategic Report.
The Board takes into account market, credit and liquidity risks in forming the Groups risk management strategy.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as changes in inflation, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups cash flows from underlying investments are linked to inflation indices.
Changes in inflation rates can have a positive or negative impact on the Groups cash flows from investments.
The long-term inflation assumptions applied in the Groups valuation of investments at fair value through profit or losses are disclosed in the fair value hierarchy section 13.4.
The Groups portfolio of investments has been developed in anticipation of continued inflation at or above the levels used in the Groups valuation assumptions.
Where inflation is at levels below the assumed levels, investment performance may be impaired.
The level of inflation linkage across the investments held by the Group varies and is not consistent.
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2014 13.
Financial Instruments continued 13.3 Financial risk and management objectives continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows from underlying investments therefore impacting the value of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk as the underlying borrowings within the unconsolidated investee entities are either hedged through interest rate swap arrangements or are fixed rate loans.
It is generally a requirement under a PFI PPP concession that any borrowings are matched to the life of the concession.
Hedging activities are aligned with the period of the loan, which also mirrors the concession period and are highly effective.
The Groups corporate facility is unhedged on the basis it is utilised as an investment bridging facility and therefore drawn for a relatively short period of time.
Therefore, the Group is not significantly exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates over its variable rate borrowings.
Interest income on bank deposits held at underlying investment level is included within the fair value of investments.
Sensitivity analysis showing the impact of variations in interest income deposit rates on the fair value of investments is shown in section 13.5.
Foreign currency risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and therefore is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Currency risk arises in financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments at the reporting date are set out in the table below: 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 000s 000s Cash Euro 2,263 1,367 Canadian Dollar 824 489 Australian Dollar 1 1 3,088 1,857 Current receivables Euro receivables 407 455 407 455 Investments at fair value through profit or loss Euro 210,962 187,104 Canadian Dollar 38,858 41,659 Australian Dollar 93,050 90,559 342,870 319,322 Total 346,365 321,634 The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of short-term volatility in foreign exchange on significant investment returns from overseas investments.
Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of dealing only with creditworthy counterparties at the underlying entity level.
PFI PPP and similar concessions are entered into with government, quasi government, other public or equivalent low risk bodies.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
The Group invests in relatively illiquid investments mainly non-listed equity and loans.
As a closed-ended investment vehicle there are no automatic redemption of capital rights.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring the forecast and actual cash flows.
Cash flow forecasts assume full availability of underlying infrastructure to the public sector entities.
Failure to maintain assets available for use or operating in accordance with pre-determined performance standards may entitle the public sector to stop wholly or partially paying the income that the Group has projected to receive.
The Directors review the underlying performance of each investment on a quarterly basis, allowing asset performance to be monitored.
Contractual mechanisms also allow for significant pass-down of unavailability and performance risk to sub-contractors.

Financial Instruments continued 13.4 Fair value hierarchy All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted market prices in an active market that are unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable During the period there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 categories.
Level 1: The Group has no financial instruments classified as level 1.
Level 2: This category includes derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, RPI Swaps and currency forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2014, the Groups only derivative financial instruments were currency forward contracts amounting to an asset of 2.9 million 2013: asset of 3.7 million.
Financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market spot exchange rates, yield curves, interest rate curves.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forward contracts which are valued using market standard pricing techniques where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Level 3: This category consists of investments in equity and loan instruments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiary entities which are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of financial instruments classified within Level 3 totalled 1,032.9 million 2013: 844.4 million.
Financial instruments are classified within Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Valuation process 1 Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors.
The valuation of unlisted equity and debt investments is performed on a quarterly basis by the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the senior members of the Investment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed by the Investment Adviser.
The Investment Adviser verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant project financial models and market information.
In addition, the accuracy of the computation is tested.
The latest valuation is also compared with the valuations in the preceding semi-annual and annual reporting periods.
The senior members of the Investment Adviser consider the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed, the Investment Adviser presents the valuation results to the Audit and Risk Committee.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments.
Any changes in valuation methods and assumptions are discussed and agreed with the Groups Audit and Risk Committee for recommendation to the Board.
In addition, any investment acquisitions by the Group from related parties are also subject to an independent valuation provided to the Board.
1 Indicative valuations performed at 31 March and 30 September where cashflows are updated for asset performance.
Macroeconomic assumptions are updated at 30 June and 31 December.
Valuation methodology The valuation methodologies used are primarily based on discounting the underlying investee entities future projected net cash flows at appropriate discount rates.
Valuations are also reviewed against recent market transactions for similar assets in comparable markets observed by the Group or Investment Adviser and adjusted where appropriate.

Financial Instruments continued 13.4 Fair value hierarchy continued Projected net future cash flows Cash flow forecasts for each underlying investment are generated through detailed project specific financial models.
Financial models forecast the project related cash flows for the full term of the underlying service concession.
The cash flows included in the forecasts used to determine fair value are typically fixed under contracts however there are certain variable cash flows which are based on management estimation.
These models also forecast the dividend, shareholder loan interest payments, capital repayments and senior debt repayments where applicable expected from the underlying investments.
Key macroeconomic inputs and assumptions utilised in projecting the Groups net future cash flows include: Europe UK Non UK North America Australia Inflation 2.75% 2.00% 2.00% 2.50% Long-term tax 20.00% 12.50% - 34.00% 25.00% - 26.50% 30.00% Foreign exchange rates N A 1.23 1.84 2.03 Long-term deposit rates 3.50% 3.00% 3.00% 4.50% Discount rate The discount rate used for valuation of each investment is the aggregate of the following: yield on government bonds with an average life equivalent to the weighted average concession length of the Group, issued by the national government for the location of the asset government bond yield : a premium to reflect the inherent greater risk in investing in infrastructure assets over government bonds: a further premium to reflect the state of maturity of the asset with a larger premium applied to immature assets and or assets in construction and or to reflect any current asset specific or operational issues.
Typically this risk premium will reduce over the life of any asset as an asset matures, its operating performance becomes more established, and the risks associated with its future cash flows decrease: a further adjustment reflective of market based transaction valuation evidence for similar assets.
Over the period, the weighted average government bond decreased by 0.67%.
This was offset by a 0.43% increase in the weighted average project premium to reflect the transactions observed in the market and the decrease in risk premia relating to construction assets nearing or that have reached completion.

Service Concession Arrangements The Group holds investments in 112 service concession arrangements in the Accommodation, Custodial, Energy and Transport sectors.
The concessions typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the accommodation based assets normally includes the provision of facilities management services such as cleaning, catering, caretaking, security, maintenance, and lifecycle.
At the end of the concession period the majority of the underlying concessions assets are returned back to the concession provider.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specific project documentation.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operators rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the operator to fulfil its obligations.
The table overleaf sets out the Groups investment in PFI concessions that are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
