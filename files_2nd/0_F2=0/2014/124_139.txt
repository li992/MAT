24 Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors.
The Groups finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups business units.
The Board provides guidance on overall market risk management including use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition, treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in Sterling but does have some purchases and sales denominated in USDollars and Euros.
Due to the hedging arrangements that have been in place for the year ended 26 January 2014, if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial effect on post tax profit year ended 26 January 2013: immaterial impact on post taxprofit.
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase foreign currencies for known purchases where the value and volume of trading purchases is known.
The Treasury Committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be applied for each forward option contract.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group other than within Pension Scheme assets.
