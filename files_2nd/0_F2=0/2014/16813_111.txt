Borrowings The Groups sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues and bank loans.
We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives.
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.
Accounting policies Capital market and bank borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value which is equal to cost at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
