Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Section 4: Financial position Section 4 contains financial statement notes that relate to the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2014, along with the relevant accounting policies.
4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates: this is performed with the assistance of external advisors.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the six business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 14 CGUs at 31 December 2014 2013: 11 CGUs.
The increase in the CGUs in 2014 is due to the Advanstar acquisition 3.
Forreporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.

The carrying amount of goodwill attributed to these CGUs at 31 December 2014 was 171.7m, 125.9m, 257.4m and 313.5m respectively.
In 2013, UBM Tech Events 167.0m, UBM Connect Events 94.3m and UBM Live Events 266.4m were considered significant.
The PR Newswire CGU is also considered to be significant.
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 97 Financial Statements Section 4: Financial position continued 4.1 Goodwill continued During the year various Other Marketing Services activities were discontinued which were not closely aligned to the Events business.
As a result, an impairment of 14.6m has been recorded against the Tech Online CGU, leaving a remaining carrying amount of 6.3m at 31December 2014.
The carrying amount attributable to the CGU is based on its value in use.
The Advanstar acquisition completed on 18 December 2014 and the purchase price allocation is ongoing on the date of issuing the consolidated financial statements.
The goodwill identified on a provisional basis has been allocated between Events, Marketing Services Online and Marketing Services Print based on contribution to profit.

In accordance with IFRS 3R Business Combinations, the Advanstar CGUs have not been tested for impairment in the year of acquisition.
The UBM Tech Online CGU has been impaired by 14.6m during the year as a result of the restructuring of the business and the implementation of the Events First strategy.
The UBM Tech Events and Print CGUs were impaired by 3.1m and 0.7m respectively during the year ended 31 December 2013.
The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Perpetuity growth Pre-tax discount rate % rate % Cash flow forecasts Events 2014: 13.4 14.7 2014: 1.7 2.5 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued expansion in 2013: 13.3 13.9 2013: 2.0 2.2 Emerging Markets Marketing Services Online 2014: 12.9 14.7 2014: 1.6 2.0 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio, away from print to digital 2013: 12.9 13.9 2013: 1.4 2.2 Focus on cost reduction through efficiency optimisation Marketing Services Print 2014: 13.5 2014: 1.6 Continued rationalisation and optimisation of the print portfolio with further 2013: 24.4 2013: 2.2 non-core titles either closed or sold, expected to result in stabilisation of print margins PR Newswire 2014: 14.4 2014: 1.6 Continued steady growth of the core wire distribution, engagement and 2013: 13.7 2013: 2.1 workflow data businesses Continued expansion in high growth markets such as China Continued investment in products, IT technology and in sales and marketing to drive continued growth in the changing competitive and technological environments Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows, budgets and forecasts are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, long term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the first five years are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2019 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate 2014: 2018.
Growth rates for each territory have been weighted based on contribution to 2015 budgeted revenue 2013: contribution to 2014 budgeted revenue.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation range from 1.6% to 2.5% 2013: 1.4% to 2.2% depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates.
98 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 4.1 Goodwill continued Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on the risk-free rate for 20 year US government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities, the systemic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
Sensitivities Following the charge for impairment, the estimated recoverable amount of the UBM Tech CGU is equal to the carrying value at 31 December 2014.
Consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
Management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU, other than Tech Online, to exceed its recoverable amount.
In the prior year the estimated recoverable amounts of the UBM Connect Events and Connect Online CGUs were not significantly higher than the carrying amounts.
The tables below show the goodwill in the CGU, the amount by which the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount the headroom and the reasonably possible percentage changes needed in isolation in each of the key assumptions that would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.
The cash flow forecasts for 2013 are expressed as the compound average growth rates in the initial five year forecasts used for the impairment testing.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for acquisitions Note 6.1 and measured on initial recognition at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense.
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
At each reporting date, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows: Brands 1015 years Software 57 years Customer contracts and relationships 110 years Subscription lists 25 years Trademarks 10 years Databases 210 years Website development costs 3 years Useful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The amortisation of internally generated or purchased software and website development costs is included in operating expenses in the income statement.
The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions is included as a separate line item in the income statement as it does not relate to operating activities.

1 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are measured at invoice amount less a provision for impairment.
A provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Trade receivables debts are written off when there is no expectation of recovery.

4.6 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Reorganisation and restructuring The provision relates to the remaining costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the UBM Tech business and other marketing services operations, as well as the onerous contract with the ExCel London Exhibition and Convention Centre.
These contracts entail minimum commitments for space rentals in excess of those foreseen to be necessary which exceed the economic benefits expected to be received and which have therefore been designated as onerous contracts.
These provisions will be utilised over the period between one to two years.
Vacant properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provisions at 31 December 2014 have been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases, which range from one to five years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
On 12 May 2014, AXIO Data Group Holdings Limited AXIO, the purchaser of the Delta Businesses, issued a claim in the High Court of England and Wales against UBM, alleging various breaches of warranties contained in the relevant sale agreement.
AXIO claims that it has suffered losses, in an amount of 17 million, and seeks to recover this sum, together with interest and costs.
UBM intends to contest the claim vigorously and on 6 June 2014 filed its defence denying the claim in its entirety.
The trial is scheduled to take place in February or March 2016.
UBM does not believe that this claim or any resolution thereof will have a significant effect on UBM and or the Groups financial position or profitability.
