D2 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 30 September 2014 1.
GENERAl INFORMATION The Paragon Group of Companies PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 with company number 2336032.
The address of the registered office is 51 Homer Road, Solihull, West Midlands, B91 3QJ.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report in section A2.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
ADOPTION OF NEw AND REvISED REPORTING STANDARDS In the preparation of these financial statements the following new reporting standards are being applied for the first time.
a Consolidation IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures form the new IFRS regime for consolidation.
These standards are effective for financial statements prepared under IFRS for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and for financial statements prepared under IFRS as endorsed by the European Union for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, though early adoption is allowed.
The directors have decided to apply these standards for the first time in the preparation of these financial statements.
The adoption of these standards does not change the entities included within the consolidated accounts from those previously consolidated, nor do consolidated results presented under the new standards differ from how they would formerly have appeared.
b IFRS 13 Fair value Measurement IFRS 13, which is applied for the first time in the preparation of these accounts, sets out new guidance on the establishment of fair value for accounting purposes and enhanced disclosures.
It applies to all amounts in the Groups financial statements presented at fair value, but its adoption has not had a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group or the Company.
c Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits In compiling these financial statements, the directors have adopted the revision to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which applies to the Groups accounts for the year ended 30 September 2014.
In accordance with the transitional provisions included in the Standard, it has been applied retrospectively.
While this revision does not affect the calculation of the deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension plan, shown in the balance sheet, the presentation of the movements in that balance in the income statement and statement of total comprehensive income is amended.
In particular: The funding cost of the plan liabilities and the expected return on the plan assets are no longer recognised in Interest Payable and Interest Receivable respectively.
Instead the funding cost of the net deficit is recognised in interest payable, at the rate which would previously have been applied to the schemes total liabilities.
The administrative costs of the plan are no longer included in the calculation of service cost, which is included within wages and salaries, but are instead calculated as a separate annual cost, included in Operating Expenses.
The actuarial gain or loss will reflect any movements in the deficit no longer reflected in the income statement.
As a deferred tax asset is recognised on the deficit, movements in deferred tax in current year income and reserves are adjusted to reflect the new accounting.

The adoption of IFRS 9 will require changes to the valuation and income recognition methods relating to the Groups Loans to Customers, Borrowings and derivative assets and liabilities.
This Standard will come into force with effect from the Groups financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2019, if it is endorsed by the European Union.
The European Union has yet to indicate when it expects the Standard to be endorsed.
Following the publication of the final version of the Standard by the IASB in July 2014, the Group has begun to assess its potential impact, and will report further on this in future periods.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 104 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 104 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts IFRS 15 will replace the standards currently governing the recognition of that part of the Groups income which does not derive directly from financial assets.
If endorsed by the European Union, it will come in to force with effect from the Groups financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2018, but is not expected to have a material impact on its results or financial position.
Other Standards and interpretations in issue but not effective do not address matters relevant to the Groups accounting and reporting.
ACCOUNTING POlICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
In the financial years reported upon this means that the financial statements accord also with International Financial Reporting Standards as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The particular policies applied are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as required in the valuation of certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements deal with the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 30 September 2014.
Subsidiaries comprise all those entities over which the Group has control.
The results of businesses acquired are dealt with in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements companies owned by charitable trusts into which loans originated by group companies were sold as part of its warehouse and securitisation funding arrangements, where the Group enjoys the benefits of ownership, are treated as subsidiaries.
Similarly, trusts set up to hold shares in conjunction with the Groups employee share ownership arrangements are also treated as subsidiaries.
c Going concern The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors reasons for the adoption of this basis are given in the Strategic Report in section A4.
d Goodwill Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, representing the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of acquired assets, including intangible assets, is held on the balance sheet and reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment has occurred.
Negative goodwill is written off as it arises.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to combinations taking place before its transition date to IFRS 1 October 2004.
Therefore any goodwill which was written off to reserves under UK GAAP will not be charged or credited to the profit and loss account on any future disposal of the business to which it relates.
e Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise purchased computer software and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Purchased computer software is capitalised where it has a sufficiently enduring nature and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 25% per annum.
Other intangible assets acquired in business combinations include brands and business networks and are capitalised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Such assets are stated at attributed cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 6.67% per annum.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 105 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 105 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts f leases Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
A finance lease is deemed to be one which transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset concerned.
Any other lease is an operating lease.
Rental income and costs under operating leases are credited or charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.
g Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost for property held under a sale and leaseback transaction represented the sale value.
Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold premises 2% per annum Short leasehold premises over the term of the lease Computer hardware 25% per annum Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 15% per annum Company motor vehicles 25% per annum h Investments in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
i loans to customers Loans to customers are considered to be loans and receivables as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are therefore accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
Loans advanced are valued at inception at the initial advance amount, which is the fair value at that time, inclusive of procuration fees paid to brokers or other business providers and less initial fees paid by the customer.
Loans acquired from third parties are initially valued at the purchase consideration paid or payable.
Thereafter all loans to customers are valued at this initial amount less the cumulative amortisation calculated using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method.
The loan balances are then reduced where necessary by a provision for balances which are considered to be impaired.
The EIR method spreads the expected net income arising from a loan over its expected life.
The EIR is that rate of interest which, at inception, exactly discounts the future cash payments and receipts arising from the loan to the initial carrying amount.
j Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within Loans to Customers at the total amount receivable less interest not yet accrued, unamortised commissions and provision for impairment.
Income from finance lease contracts is accounted for on the actuarial basis.
k Impairment of loans and receivables Loans and receivables are reviewed for indications of possible impairment throughout the year and at each balance sheet date, in accordance with IAS 39.
Where loans exhibit objective evidence of impairment, the carrying value of the loans is reduced to the net present value of their expected future cash flows, including the value of the potential realisation of any security, discounted at the original EIR.
Loans are assessed collectively, grouped by risk characteristics and account is taken of any impairment arising due to events which are believed to have taken place but have not been specifically identified at the balance sheet date.
For financial accounting purposes provisions for impairments of loans to customers are held in an allowance account.
These balances are offset against the gross value of the loan when it is written off on the administration system.
After this point a salvage balance may be held in respect of any further recoveries expected on the loan.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 106 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 106 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts l Investments in structured entities Investments in structured entities are intended to be held to maturity and are therefore accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
The return from such investments is calculated on the EIR basis.
m Amounts owed by or to group companies In the accounts of the Company balances owed by or to other group companies are carried at the current amount outstanding less any provision.
Where balances owing between group companies fall within the definition of either financial assets or financial liabilities given in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation they are classified as Loans and Receivables or Other financial liabilities, respectively.
n Short term investments Short term investments are held as part of the liquidity requirement of Paragon Bank PLC.
As such they are designated as Available for Sale, as defined by IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and are consequently measured at their fair value which corresponds to their market value at the balance sheet date.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within interest receivable.
o Cash and cash equivalents Balances shown as cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise demand deposits and short-term deposits with banks with initial maturities of not more than 90 days.
p Own shares Shares in The Paragon Group of Companies PLC held in treasury or by the trustees of the Groups employee share ownership plans are shown on the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at total equity.
Own shares are stated at cost.
q Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Tax relating to items taken directly to equity is also taken directly to equity.
r Retail deposits Retail deposits are carried in the balance sheet on the amortised cost basis.
The initial fair value recognised represents the cash amount received from the customer.
Interest payable to the customer is expensed to the income statement as interest payable over the deposit term on an Effective Interest Rate basis.
s Borrowings Borrowings are carried in the balance sheet on the amortised cost basis.
The initial value recognised includes the principal amount received less any discount on issue or costs of issuance.
Interest and all other costs of the funding are expensed to the income statement as interest payable over the term of the borrowing on an Effective Interest Rate basis.
t Finance lease payables Balances due on the lease arising from the sale and leaseback of a Group property were recognised in creditors at the total amount payable less interest not yet accrued.
Interest was accrued on the actuarial basis.
The profit which arose on the sale and leaseback transaction was held within deferred income and was credited to profit over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 107 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 107 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts u Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group comprise currency swap, interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of the existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All derivatives are carried in the balance sheet at fair value, as assets where the value is positive or as liabilities where the value is negative.
Fair value is based on market prices, where a market exists.
If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using present value models which incorporate assumptions based on market conditions and are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement, except where such amounts are permitted to be taken to equity as part of the accounting for a cash flow hedge.
v Hedging For all hedges, the Group documents, at inception, the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management strategy and objectives for undertaking the transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging arrangements put in place are considered to be highly effective as defined by IAS 39.
For a fair value hedge, as long as the hedging relationship is deemed highly effective and meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in income can be offset against the fair value loss or gain arising from the hedged item for the hedged risk.
For macro hedges hedges of interest rate risk for a portfolio of loan assets or retail deposit liabilities this fair value adjustment is disclosed in the balance sheet alongside the hedged item, for other hedges the adjustment is made to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability.
Only the net ineffectiveness of the hedge is charged or credited to income.
Where a fair value hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the fair value adjustment is amortised over the remaining term of the underlying item.
Where a derivative is used to hedge the variability of cash flows of an asset or liability, it may be designated as a cash flow hedge so long as this relationship meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39.
For such an instrument the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is taken initially to equity, with the ineffective part taken to profit or loss.
The amount taken to equity is released to the income statement at the same time as the hedged item affects the income statement.
Where a cash flow hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the amount taken to equity will remain there until the hedged transaction is recognised, or is no longer highly probable.
w Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.
As required by IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to take account of the expected timing of realisation.
x Retirement benefit obligations The expected cost of providing pensions within the funded defined benefit scheme, determined on the basis of annual valuations by professionally qualified actuaries using the projected unit method, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and do not form part of the result for the period, being recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
The expected financing cost of the deficit, as estimated at the beginning of the period is recognised in the result for the period within interest payable.
Any variances against the estimated amount in the year form part of the actuarial gain or loss.
The charge to the income statement for providing pensions under defined contribution pension schemes is equal to the contributions payable to such schemes for the year.
y Revenue The revenue of the Group comprises interest receivable and similar charges and other income.
The accounting policy for the recognition of each element of revenue is described separately within these accounting policies.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 108 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 108 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts z Fee and commission income Other income includes administration fees charged to borrowers, which are credited when the related service is performed, fees charged to third parties for account administration services, which are credited as those services are performed, and commissions receivable on the sale of insurances, which are taken to profit at the point at which the Group becomes unconditionally entitled to the income.
aa Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments, the fair value at the date of grant of awards to be made in respect of options and shares granted under the terms of the Groups various share based employee incentive arrangements is charged to the profit and loss account over the period between the date of grant and the vesting date.
National Insurance on share based payments is accrued over the vesting period, based on the share price at the balance sheet date.
Where the allowable cost of share based awards for tax purposes is greater than the cost determined in accordance with IFRS 2, the tax effect of the excess is taken to reserves.
bb Dividends In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date, dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised in equity once they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date, but before the authorisation of the financial statements remain within shareholders funds.
cc Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
The functional currency of the Group is the pound sterling.
Transactions which are not denominated in sterling are translated into sterling at the spot rate of exchange on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities which are not denominated in sterling are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in interest payable or interest receivable depending on whether the underlying instrument is an asset or a liability, except where deferred in equity in accordance with the cash flow hedging provisions of IAS 39. dd Segmental reporting The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described above for the Group as a whole.
Costs attributed to each segment represent the direct costs incurred by the segment operations and an allocation of the costs of areas of the business which serve all segments.
Such allocations are weighted by the value of loan assets in each segment, adjusted for the relative effort involved in the administration of each asset class.
FAIR vAlUES OF FINANCIAl ASSETS AND FINANCIAl lIABIlITIES Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair values in the accounts.
The Group uses a number of techniques to determine the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities, for which observable prices in active markets are not available.
These are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash flows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate.
The principal inputs to these valuation models are LIBOR benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the instruments are denominated, sterling, euros and dollars.
The cross currency basis swaps have a notional principal related to the outstanding currency borrowings and therefore the estimated rate of repayment of these notes also affects the valuation of the swaps.
In order to determine the fair values the management applies valuation adjustments to observed data where that data would not fully reflect the attributes of the instrument being valued, such as particular contractural features or the identity of the counter-party.
The management reviews the models used on an ongoing basis to ensure that the valuations produced are reasonable and reflect all relevant factors.
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, IFRS 7 requires that the measurements should be classified using a fair value hierarchy reflecting the inputs used, and defines three levels.
Level 1 measurements are unadjusted market prices, level 2 measurements are derived from observable data, such as market prices or rates, while level 3 measurements rely on significant inputs which are not derived from observable data.
As described above the valuations of the Groups derivatives are based on market information and they are therefore classified as level 2 measurements.
Details of these assets are given in note 36.
The short term investments described in note 38 are freely traded securities for which a market price quotation is available and are classified as level 1 measurements.
The Group had no financial assets or liabilities in the Annual Report & Accounts 2014 109 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 109 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts year ended 30 September 2014 or the year ended 30 September 2013 valued using level 3 measurements.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes, which are carried at amortised cost are considered to be not materially different from their book values.
In arriving at that conclusion market inputs have been considered but because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset to market rates on a quarterly basis, little difference arises.
While the Groups asset backed loan notes are listed, the quoted prices for an individual note may not be indicative of the fair value of the issue as a whole, due to the specialised nature of the market in such instruments and the limited number of investors participating in it and an adjustment is required.
As these valuation exercises are not wholly market based they are considered to be level 2 measurements.
To assess the likely fair value of the Groups retail deposit liabilities, the directors have considered the estimated cash flows expected to arise based on a mixture of market based inputs, such as rates and pricing and non-market based inputs such as redemption rates.
On this basis they have concluded that the carrying value of these liabilities, determined on the amortised cost basis, is not significantly different from their fair value derived on a discounted cash flow basis.
Given the mixture of observable and non-observable inputs these are considered to be level 2 measurements.
To assess the likely fair value of the Groups loan assets in the absence of a liquid market, the directors have considered the estimated cash flows expected to arise from the Groups investments in its loans to customers based on a mixture of market based inputs, such as rates and pricing and non-market based inputs such as redemption rates.
On this basis they have concluded that the carrying value of these assets, determined on the amortised cost basis, is not significantly different from the fair value of the assets derived on a discounted cash flow basis.
CRITICAl ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Certain of the balances reported in the financial statements are based wholly or in part on estimates or assumptions made by the directors.
There is, therefore, a potential risk that they may be subject to change in future periods.
The most significant of these are: a Impairment losses on loans to customers Impairment losses on loans are calculated based on statistical models.
The key assumptions relate to estimates of future cash flows from customers accounts, their timing and, for secured accounts, the expected proceeds from the realisation of the property.
These key assumptions are based on observed data from historical patterns and are updated regularly based on new data as it becomes available.
In addition the directors consider how appropriate past trends and patterns might be in the current economic situation and make any adjustments they believe are necessary to reflect current conditions.
The accuracy of the impairment calculations would therefore be affected by unexpected changes to the economic situation, variances between the models used and the actual results, or assumptions which differ from the actual outcomes.
In particular, if the impact of economic factors such as employment levels on customers is worse than is implicit in the model then the number of accounts requiring provision might be greater than suggested by the model, while falls in house prices, over and above any assumed by the model might increase the provision required in respect of accounts currently provided.
b Effective interest rates In order to determine the effective interest rate applicable to loans an estimate must be made of the expected life of each loan and hence the cash flows relating thereto.
For purchased accounts this will involve estimating the likely future performance of the accounts at the time of acquisition.
These estimates are based on historical data and reviewed regularly.
For purchased accounts historical data obtained from the vendor will be examined.
The accuracy of the effective interest rate applied would therefore be compromised by any differences between actual borrower behaviour and that predicted.
c Fair values Where financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, in the majority of cases this can be derived by reference to quoted market prices.
Where such a quoted price is not available the valuation is based on cash flow models based, where possible, on independently sourced parameters.
The accuracy of the calculation would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements or other variances in the operation of the models or the assumptions used.
d Retirement benefits The present value of the retirement benefit obligation is derived from an actuarial calculation which rests on a number of assumptions.
Where actual conditions differ from those assumed the ultimate value of the obligation would be different.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 110 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
CAPITAl MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives in managing capital are: To ensure that the Group has sufficient capital to meet its operational requirements and strategic objectives: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk: and To ensure that sufficient regulatory capital is available to meet any externally imposed requirements.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk, availability and cost.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets, having particular regard to the relative costs and availability of debt and equity finance at any given time.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, issue or redeem other capital instruments, such as retail or corporate bonds, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Following the authorisation of Paragon Bank by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA, the Group became subject to regulatory capital rules on a consolidated basis.
This is discussed further below.
a Dividend cover Following its rights issue in 2008 the Group pursued a progressive dividend policy with the dividend being increased from 3.0p in respect of that year to 4.0p in respect of the year ended 30 September 2011.
In 2012 as a result of the progress of the business, the directors adopted a new policy under which the dividends will increase so that, by the year ending 30 September 2016, the level of dividend cover will be maintained in the range 3.0 to 3.5 times.
The expected level of dividend cover in respect of the year, subject to the approval of the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting, is shown below.

indd 111 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts c Gearing The Board of Directors regularly review the proportion of working capital represented by debt and equity.
Net debt is calculated as total debt, other than securitised and warehouse debt, valued at principal value, less free cash up to a maximum of the total debt.
Adjusted equity comprises all components of equity i. e. share capital, share premium, minority interest, retained earnings and revaluation surplus other than amounts recognised in equity relating to cash flow hedges.

indd 112 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts d Regulatory capital The Group is subject to supervision by the PRA on a consolidated basis, as a group containing an authorised bank.
As part of this supervision the regulator will issue individual capital guidance setting an amount of regulatory capital, defined under the international Basel III rules, implemented through the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive CRD IV, which the Group is required to hold relative to its risk weighted assets in order to safeguard depositors against the risk of losses being incurred by the Group.
The Groups regulatory capital is monitored by the Board of Directors and the Asset and Liability Committee, who ensure that appropriate action is taken to ensure compliance with the regulators requirements.
The future regulatory capital requirement is also considered as part of the Groups forecasting and strategic planning process.
At 30 September 2014 the Groups regulatory capital of 981.1m 2013: 934.0m was comfortably in excess of that required by the regulator.
Although the Group was not subject to supervision at 30 September 2013, disclosures at that date are provided in this section for comparative purposes.
The Groups regulatory capital differs from its equity as certain adjustments are required by the regulator.
A reconciliation of the Groups equity to its regulatory capital determined in accordance with CRD IV at 30 September 2014 is set out below.
Note 2014 2013 m m Total equity 947.1 873.3 Deductions Proposed final dividend 46 18.3 14.6 Intangible assets 24 7.9 8.5 Deferred tax adjustment 0.5 0.6 Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital 920.4 849.6 Other tier 1 capital - - Total Tier 1 capital 920.4 849.6 Corporate bond 51 110.0 110.0 Less: amortisation adjustment 53.8 31.8 56.2 78.2 Collectively assessed credit impairment allowances 4.5 6.2 Total Tier 2 capital 60.7 84.4 Total regulatory capital 981.1 934.0 Deferred tax assets in subsidiary companies are required to be deducted from regulatory capital.
This balance is offset against the deferred tax liability in the consolidated accounts.
When tier 2 capital instruments have less than five years to maturity the amount eligible as regulatory capital reduces by 20% per annum.
As the Groups 110m Corporate Bond matures in 2017, this adjustment is required.

Individual entities within the Group are also subject to supervision on a standalone basis.
All such entities complied with the requirements to which they were subject during the year.
FINANCIAl RISk MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks arising from the Groups normal business activities are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
During the year the Board established a Risk and Compliance Committee, consisting of non-executive directors.
The Credit Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO are executive sub-committees of the Risk and Compliance Committee which review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
The Corporate Governance Statement in Section B2 provides further detail on the operations of these committees.
Before the establishment of the Risk and Compliance Committee the other committees reported directly to the Board.
The financial risk management policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end.
The position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
Paragon Bank has its own risk management structure which is overseen by the Group committees.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 114 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 114 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are contracts with counter-parties and are used only to limit the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Groups derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes only.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under the IAS 39 rules, while in other cases hedge accounting has not been adopted either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because complying with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules would be particulary onerous.
The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate prepayable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
b hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate retail deposits with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
In both cases the Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets and liabilities.
The Group has also designated cash flow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a specified foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
The Company has no derivative assets or liabilities.
Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and in the collections process.
Primary responsibility for credit risk management across the Group lies with the Credit Committee.
The Credit Committee is made up of four senior members of staff, headed by the Group Finance Director.
Its key responsibilities include setting and reviewing credit policy, controlling applicant quality, tracking account performance against targets, agreeing product criteria and lending guidelines and monitoring performance and trends.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments, short-term investments and cash deposits, ALCO determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
The assets of the Group and the Company which are subject to credit risk are set out below: The Group The Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 Note m m m m Loans to customers 32 9,255.9 8,801.5 - - Investments in structured entities 35 19.3 23.8 - - Derivative financial assets 36 693.9 890.0 - - Amounts owed by Group companies 37 - - 103.9 115.0 Accrued interest 37 0.3 0.2 - - Short term investments 38 39.4 - - - Cash 39 848.8 587.3 166.5 153.9 Maximum exposure to credit risk 10,857.6 10,302.8 270.4 268.9 While this maximum exposure represents the potential loss which might have to be accounted for by the Group, the terms on which the Groups loan assets are funded, described under Liquidity Risk below, limit the amount of principal repayments on the Groups securitised and warehouse borrowings in cases of capital losses on assets, significantly reducing the effective shareholder value at risk.

indd 115 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Loans to customers and other investments in loan assets The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its loans to customers.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk due to the large number of customers included in the portfolios.
The Groups loan assets at 30 September 2014 are analysed as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 m % m % Buy-to-let mortgages 8,592.1 92.8% 8,324.4 94.6% Owner occupied mortgages 59.6 0.7% 77.4 0.9% Total first mortgages 8,651.7 93.5% 8,401.8 95.5% Secured loans 436.2 4.7% 248.4 2.8% Loans secured on property 9,087.9 98.2% 8,650.2 98.3% Car loans 5.7 0.1% 1.3 - Retail finance loans 0.4 - 1.5 - Other loans 161.9 1.7% 148.5 1.7% Total loans to customers 9,255.9 100.0% 8,801.5 100.0% Other loans include unsecured loans either advanced by Group companies or acquired from their originators at a discount.
The Groups underwriting philosophy is based on a combination of sophisticated individual credit assessment and the automated efficiencies of a scored decision making process.
Information on each applicant is combined with data taken from a credit reference bureau to provide a complete credit picture of the applicant and the borrowing requested.
Key information is validated through a combination of documentation and statistical data which collectively provides evidence of the applicants ability and willingness to pay the amount contracted under the loan agreement.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are effectively secured by the financed vehicle.
Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In considering whether to acquire pools of loan assets or invest in loan portfolios, the Group will undertake a due diligence exercise on the underlying loan accounts.
Such assets are generally not fully performing and are offered at a discount to their current balance.
The Groups procedures may include inspection of original loan documents, verification of security and the examination of the credit status of borrowers.
Current and historic cash flow data will also be examined.
The objective of the exercise is to establish, to a level of confidence similar to that provided by the underwriting process, that the assets will generate sufficient cash flows to recover the Groups investment and generate an appropriate return.
An analysis of the indexed loan to value ratio LTV for those loan accounts secured on property by value at 30 September 2014 is set out below.
For acquired accounts the effect of any discount on purchase is allowed for.
indd 116 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts The regionally indexed LTVs shown above are affected by changes in house prices, with the Nationwide house price index, for the UK as a whole, registering an annual increase of 9.4% in the year ended 30 September 2014 2013: 5.0%.
The number of accounts in arrears by asset class, based on the most commonly quoted definition of arrears for the type of asset, at 30 September 2014 and 30 September 2013, compared to the industry averages at those dates published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML and the Finance and Leasing Association FLA, was: 2014 2013 % % First mortgages Accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.25 0.35 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.04 0.07 Owner Occupied accounts 3.94 4.24 CML data for mortgage accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.78 1.15 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.69 0.99 Owner Occupied accounts 1.55 1.86 All mortgages 1.42 1.75 Secured loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 19.84 21.46 FLA data for secured loans 17.20 17.50 Car loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 7.85 25.52 FLA data for all personal loans 4.10 5.80 Other loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 87.50 81.98 No published industry data for asset classes comparable to the Groups other books has been identified.
Where revised data at 30 September 2013 has been published by the FLA or CML, the comparative industry figures above have been amended.
The Group calculates its headline arrears measure for buy-to-let mortgages shown above, based on the numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears, including purchased Idem assets, but excluding those cases in possession and receiver of rent cases designated for sale.
This is consistent with the methodology used by the CML in compiling its statistics for the buy-to-let mortgage market as a whole.
The number of accounts in arrears will be higher for closed books such as the owner occupied mortgage book and the retail finance and unsecured loan books than for comparable active ones, as performing accounts pay off their balances, leaving arrears accounts representing a greater proportion of the total.
The improvement in the arrears position for car loans shown above is due to the recommencement of lending in this market, through Paragon Bank, with the new performing cases reducing the overall average.
The figures shown above for secured loans and other loans include purchased portfolios which generally include a high proportion of cases in arrears at the time of purchase and where this level of performance is allowed for in the discount to current balance represented by the purchase price.

Where assets have been purchased by the Idem Capital loan investment business, customers may already have been in arrears at the time of acquisition and an appropriate adjustment made to the consideration paid.
Investments in structured entities represent the Groups contribution made to special purpose vehicle SPV companies established and controlled by third parties to purchase pools of loan assets.
All such investments are denominated in sterling and the underlying loans are made to United Kingdom borrowers.
Cash generated by the assets is distributed to investors in accordance with a specified priority of payments.
The Group has no obligation to make further contributions to the SPV companies concerned.
The management has considered the position of the underlying assets and concluded that they will generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amount of the investment.
In the debt purchase industry, Estimated Remaining Collections ERC is commonly used as a measure of the value of a portfolio.
This is defined as the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be received over a specified future period.
In the Groups view, this measure may be suitable for heavily discounted, unsecured, distressed portfolios, but is less applicable for the types of portfolio in which the Group has invested, where cash flows are higher on acquisition, loans may be secured on property and customers may not be in default.
In such cases, the IAS 39 amortised cost balance, at which these assets are carried in the Group balance sheet, provides a better indication of value.
However, to aid comparability the 84 and 120 month ERC values for the Groups purchased assets included in the Idem Capital division, are set out below, analysed by the balance sheet line on which they appear.
These are derived using the same models and assumptions used in the EIR calculations, but the differing bases of calculation lead to different outcomes.

indd 119 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Derivative financial assets In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments and cash deposits, ALCO determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Such counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the Groups securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the financing arrangements, which are monitored externally.
Where a derivative counterparty fails to meet the required criteria they are obliged under the terms of the instruments to set aside a cash collateral deposit.
The amounts of these cash collateral deposits, which do not form part of the Groups cash position, are given in note 36.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of the counterparties to its derivative financial assets, analysed by their long term credit rating as determined by Fitch is set out below.
2014 2013 m m Carrying value of derivative financial assets Counterparties rated AA- 193.5 261.1 A 4.2 6.8 A 496.2 622.1 Gross exposure 693.9 890.0 Collateral amounts posted 87.3 120.4 Net exposure 606.6 769.6 Short term investments The Groups short term investments are held within Paragon Bank and form part of the liquidity buffer it is required to hold by the PRA.
These investments may only be placed in treasury bills and gilts issued by the UK government, or such similar instruments as are permitted by the regulator, and as such the credit risk is judged to be minimal.
Cash and cash equivalents The Groups cash balances are held in sterling at highly rated banks in current accounts and as short fixed term deposits and money market placements.
The Group has a large exposures policy to mitigate any concentration risk in respect of its cash deposits.
Credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be minimal.
liquidity risk The Group uses securitisation to mitigate its exposure to liquidity risk on its borrowings, ensuring, as far as possible, that the maturities of assets and liabilities are matched.
Paragon Bank, which commenced deposit taking in the year, is subject to regulation by the PRA in this respect, which aims to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are held to mitigate the liquidity risk inherent in deposit taking.
The Groups originated loan assets, outside Paragon Bank, are principally financed by asset backed loan notes Notes issued through the securitisation process.
In a securitisation an SPV company within the Group will issue Notes secured on a pool of mortgage or other loan assets owned by the SPV in a public offer.
The Notes have a maturity date later than the final repayment date for any asset in the pool, typically over thirty years from the issue date.
The noteholders are entitled to receive repayment of the Note principal from principal funds generated by the loan assets from time to time, but their right to the repayment of principal is limited to the cash available in the SPV.
Similarly, payment of accrued interest to the noteholders is limited to cash generated within the SPV.
There is no requirement for any Group company other than the issuing SPV to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes.
This matching of the maturities of the assets and the related funding substantially reduces the Groups exposure to liquidity risk.
Details of Notes in issue are given in note 51 and the assets backing the Notes are shown in notes 30 and 31.
During the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group extended securitisation funding to certain of the purchased assets generated through its Idem Capital business.
Although privately funded, these SPVs have similar liquidity risk characteristics to the public issues described above.
In each case the Group provides funding to the SPV at inception, subordinated to the Notes, which means that the primary credit risk on the pool assets is retained within the Group.
The Group receives the residual income generated by the assets.
These factors mean that the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets remain with the Group, and hence the loans remain on the Groups balance sheet.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 120 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 120 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Cash received from time to time in each SPV is held until the next interest payment date when, following payment of principal, interest and the associated costs of the SPV, the remaining balances become available to the Group.
Cash balances are also held within each SPV to provide credit enhancement for the particular securitisation, allowing interest and principal payments to be made even if some of the loans default.
In order to provide further credit enhancement in certain of the SPVs, specific economic trigger events exist which cause additional cash to be retained in the SPV rather than being transferred to the Group.
While the Group can, if it chooses, contribute additional cash to cover these requirements, it is under no obligation to do so.
During the year ended 30 September 2013, one such trigger event occurred in Paragon Secured Finance No.
1 plc, one of the Groups consumer finance securitisations, and 2.4m of additional cash was retained in that company.
No such events occurred in the year ended 30 September 2014.
Whether any such events in any of the Groups other SPVs arise in the future will depend on the performance of the general economy and its impact on mortgage and loan arrears in each SPV.
However if all of the remaining trigger events occurred, a total of 77.7m of additional cash would be retained in the SPV companies 2013: 70.5m.
The cash balances of the SPV companies are included within the restricted cash balances disclosed in note 39.
Newly originated mortgage loans are initially funded by a revolving loan facility or warehouse from the point of their origination until their inclusion in a securitisation transaction.
A warehouse company functions in a similar way to an SPV, except that funds are drawn down as advances are made, repaid when loans are securitised and may subsequently be redrawn.
On 29 February 2008 the warehouse facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited ceased to be available for new drawings and new mortgage lending ceased, although the secured assets held within it at that time continued to be funded.
Repayment of the principal on this warehouse facility is not required unless amounts are realised from the underlying secured assets.
The final repayment date of the facility is later than the final due date of the secured assets it funds.
Mortgage loans advanced since the recommencement of lending in 2010 have been funded through one of three warehouse facilities, which are detailed in note 51.
Each warehouse facility is agreed with an individual bank and is available for drawing and redrawing for a set commitment period, although each has the option to be renewed before the period ends.
After the end of the commitment period the funding will remain in place for a further period until the underlying assets can be sold or refinanced.
Repayment of the principal amount of the facilities is not required unless amounts are realised from the secured assets either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the end of the period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowings.
The warehouse facilities due for expiry in the period were all renewed on the same or improved terms.
As with the SPVs, the Group provides subordinated funding to the warehouse companies and restricted cash balances are held within them.
Contributions to the subordinated funding are made each time a drawing on the facility concerned is made.
These amounts provide credit enhancement to the warehouse and cover certain fees.
This funding is repaid when assets are securitised.
The amount of subordinated funding outstanding in the three active warehouse companies at 30 September 2014 was 41.4 million 2013: 38.8 million.
Further details of the warehouse facilities are given in note 51 and details of the loan assets within the warehouses are given in note 30.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively limit liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that sufficient funding is available to fund the Groups participation in the SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with ALCO which sets the Groups liquidity policy and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.
The final repayment date for all of the securitisation borrowings and the old warehouse borrowing is more than five years from the balance sheet date, the earliest falling due in 2033 and the latest in 2050.
The equivalent sterling principal amount outstanding at 30 September 2014 under the SPV and warehouse arrangements, allowing for the effect of the cross currency basis swaps, described under currency risk below, which are net settled with the loan payments, was 8,829.6m 2013: 8,324.0m.
The total sterling amount payable under these arrangements, were these principal amounts to remain outstanding until the final repayment date would be 16,694.4m 2013: 17,363.4m.
As the principal will, as discussed above, reduce as customers repay or redeem their accounts, the cash flow will in practice be far less than this amount.
In February 2013, the Group initiated a Euro Medium Term Note issuance programme, with a maximum issuance of 1,000.0m, from which, in January 2014, it made an issue of 125.0m of fixed term retail bonds falling due for payment in December 2021.
The Group had the ability to issue further notes under the programme within twelve months of its inauguration and it was subsequently renewed for a further twelve months in October 2014 and may be further renewed.
The Groups investments in purchased loan portfolios and structured entities are funded from its free cash balances and securitisation borrowings and these investments carry no obligation to make further payments.
They therefore pose no liquidity risk to the Group.

The cash flows described above will include those for interest on borrowings accrued at 30 September 2014 disclosed in note 56.
In order to reduce the liquidity risk inherent in the retail deposit balances shown above, which are held by Paragon Bank PLC, its regulator, the PRA requires that it, like other regulated banks, maintains a buffer in the form of liquid assets to ensure it has sufficient available funds at all times to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of this buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA submitted by Paragon Bank.
In addition, further liquid resources must be maintained based upon stress tests linked to the key liquidity risks of Paragon Bank and for other purposes specified by the regulator.
At 30 September 2014 the liquidity buffer comprises the 39.4m of assets 2013: nil shown as short term investments in the Groups balance sheet note 38, together with certain of the cash balances shown as Bank Cash in note 39.

indd 122 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Interest rate risk The Group manages interest rate risk, the risk that margins will be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates, by maintaining floating rate liabilities and matching these with floating rate assets, by hedging fixed rate assets and liabilities using interest rate swap or cap agreements and by maintaining a proportion of fixed rate liabilities.
The Groups ALCO monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations and the terms of other borrowings.
Paragon Bank has its own ALCO which focuses on the risks within the bank, including the retail deposit position, although the Groups committee maintains oversight.
The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset either quarterly or monthly on the basis of LIBOR.
Where asset backed loan notes are issued in foreign currencies, cross-currency basis swaps are put in place converting the reference interest rate to a sterling LIBOR basis.
The Groups retail deposits either bear variable interest rates or are fixed rate liabilities which are hedged in accordance with the Groups risk management strategy.
The interest rates paid on the Groups variable rate deposits are determined by reference to, inter alia, returns achievable in the Groups lending markets and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
The Groups loan assets predominantly bear LIBOR linked interest rates or are hedged fixed rate assets.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally these factors ensure the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
The return to the Group from its investments in structured entities is primarily attributable to the cash generation of the underlying portfolio.
There is no direct exposure to market interest rate risk.
The Groups working capital borrowings comprise corporate bonds and retail bonds issued under a Euro Medium Term Note Programme.
All bonds issued to date have fixed interest rates and therefore are not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, although the retail bond programme includes the facility to issue floating rate instruments in the future.
The Group has entered into various interest rate basis swap arrangements to alter the effective basis of interest payments on certain borrowings to match the underlying assets, though due to their nature and low notional value, they do not have a significant impact on the Groups results.
To assess the Groups exposure to interest rate movements, the notional impact of a 1% change in UK interest rates on the equity of the Group at 30 September 2014, and the notional annualised impact of such a change on the operating profit of the Group, based on the year-end balance sheet have been calculated.
On this basis, a 1% increase in UK interest rates would reduce the Groups equity at 30 September 2014 by 4.0m 2013: 4.0m and increase profit before tax by 11.3m 2013: 8.2m.
This calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in UK interest rates.
In practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the Groups business and results.
Although certain of the Groups borrowings have interest rates dependant on US Dollar and Euro LIBOR rates, the effect of the cross currency basis swaps is such that the Groups results have no material exposure to movements in these rates.
The effects of independent 1% increases in US or Euro interest rates would be to increase the Groups equity by 1.3m 2013: 1.2m and 2.0m 2013: 2.1m respectively.
All the borrowings of the Company have fixed interest rates.
Assets and liabilities with other group companies bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date.
The finance lease bore notional interest only: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 123 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
indd 123 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts Currency risk All of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 51.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, a condition of the issue of these notes was that interest rate and currency swaps cross-currency basis swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk, and no sensitivity analysis is presented for currency risk.

The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 124 GRP8641 - Annual report and accounts 2014 FINAL.
SEGMENTAl INFORMATION Following the authorisation of its banking subsidiary in the year the Group conducted a review of its internal reporting requirements and concluded that the most relevant analysis of its business was that based on the entities within the Group generating its assets.
This reflects current internal management structures and the differing regulatory environments in which the Group operates.
This new format of reporting was adopted for internal use and therefore the segments presented in these financial statements have been determined in a similar way.
Paragon Mortgages includes revenue, in the form of interest and ancillary income, from the Groups first mortgage operations, other than the buy-to-let lending of Paragon Bank, and from assets remaining in other, legacy, portfolios.
Idem Capital includes revenue generated from assets purchased by the Groups debt investment business, Idem Capital Holdings Limited and third party loan administration activity.
Paragon Bank includes revenue, in the form of interest and ancillary income, generated from the Groups regulated banking business, Paragon Bank PLC.
Each of these businesses invests in consumer finance assets, and an analysis of the Groups financial assets by type and segment is shown in note 29.
Dedicated financing and administration costs of each of these businesses are allocated to the segment and shared costs, and the financing costs of the Groups working capital invested, are allocated based on the segments use of those resources.
All of the Groups operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, all revenues arise from external customers and there are no inter-segment revenues.
No customer contributes more than 10% of the revenue of the Group.
Financial information about these business segments, prepared on the same basis as used in the consolidated accounts of the Group, is shown below.
Results for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been reanalysed on the basis of the new segments, as well as being restated for the change in accounting standard described in note 2.

Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The losses and gains are primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.
Such differences will reverse over time and have no impact on the cash flows of the Group.

GOODwIll The goodwill carried in the accounts was recognised on the acquisition of The Business Mortgage Company and its subsidiaries TBMC in December 2008.
The cash generating unit to which this goodwill was attributed for impairment testing purposes was TBMC, which is the lowest level within the Group at which this goodwill is currently monitored, though the operations of the acquired entity will, in time, be integrated with those of the First Mortgage division.
An impairment review undertaken at 30 September 2009 indicated a write down of 6.0m which was charged to the profit and loss account.
Further reviews were undertaken at each year-end up to 30 September 2014 each of which indicated no further impairment.
The recoverable amount of TBMC used in this impairment testing is determined on a value in use basis using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a four year period.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projection is 6.7% and cash flows beyond the four year budget are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate, being the average long term growth rate in the United Kingdom economy over a twenty year period.
The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for the TBMC business are: Level of business activity, based on management expectations.
Management have concluded that the levels of activity assumed for the purpose of this forecast are reasonable, based on past experience and the current economic environment.
Discount rate, which is based on the Groups cost of capital.
The directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

FINANCE lEASE RECEIvABlES The Groups finance lease receivables are car finance loans.
The average contractual life of such loans is 65 months 2013: 56 months, but it is likely that a significant proportion of customers will choose to settle their obligations early.

Whilst the Group has the benefit of the underlying vehicle as security on these loans, no account of this is taken in the allowance for uncollectible amounts shown above.
The Group has insufficient information on the current condition of finance leased vehicles to derive a reliable estimate of the value which could be realised from vehicles to offset against arrears accounts.

INvESTMENT IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES Investments in structured entities represent the Groups contribution made to special purpose vehicle SPV companies established and controlled by unrelated third parties to purchase pools of loan assets.
All such investments are denominated in sterling, unlisted and are considered to be debt investments as defined by IFRS.
The underlying loans are secured and unsecured consumer loans made to United Kingdom borrowers.
The Group is under no obligation to make any further contribution to these entities.

DERIvATIvE FINANCIAl ASSETS AND lIABIlITIES All of the Groups financial derivatives are held for economic hedging purposes, although not all may be designated for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.
The analysis below therefore splits derivatives between those accounted for as hedges and those which, while representing an economic hedge, do not qualify for this treatment.
All of the financial derivatives shown are valued using methodologies where the principal inputs are directly or indirectly derived from market data and are therefore classified within level two of the fair value hierarchy laid down by IFRS 7.
The Groups securitisation borrowings are denominated in sterling, euros and US dollars.
All currency borrowings are swapped at inception so that they have the effect of sterling borrowings.
These swaps provide an effective hedge against exchange rate movements, but the requirement to carry them at fair value leads, when exchange rates have moved significantly since the issue of the notes, to large balances for the swaps being carried in the balance sheet.
This is currently the case with both euro and US dollar swaps, although the debit balance is compensated for by retranslating the borrowings at the current exchange rate.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within Financial Assets note 29 and Financial Liabilities note 49 respectively.

OBlIGATIONS UNDER FINANCE lEASES The finance lease obligations recorded in the accounts arise from a sale and leaseback transaction of one of the Groups office buildings in 1997 which falls to be treated as a finance lease under IAS 17 - Leases.
The lease was due to expire in 2019 and was subject to five yearly rent reviews, with guaranteed minimum rent increases.
During the year the freehold of the property was reacquired by the Company and the liability was extinguished note 26.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBlIGATIONS The Group has adopted IAS 19 revised 2011 for the first time in the preparation of these accounts note 2 and the disclosures set out below differ from those presented in previous years accounts due to the changed requirements of the new Standard.
a Defined benefit plan - Description The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK the Plan.
The Plan assets are held in a separate fund, administered by a corporate trustee, to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Plan is required by law to act in the best interests of the Plans beneficiaries and is responsible for the investment policy adopted in respect of the Plans assets.
The appointment of directors to the Trustee is determined by the Plans trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all directors of the Trustee should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the Plan.
Employees who are members of the Plan are entitled to receive a pension of 1 60 of their final basic annual salary for every year of eligible service to a maximum of 2 3.
Dependants of members of the Plan are eligible for a dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The principal actuarial risks to which the Plan is exposed are: Investment risk The risk that income is generated on the Plans investments at a rate lower than the rate at which the defined benefit liability is calculated, which would cause an increased deficit in the Plan.
The trustee keeps the allocation of the Plans investments under review to manage this risk on a long term basis.
Interest risk A decrease in bond yields will reduce the discount rate used in valuing the deficit and hence increase the Plan liability.
Inflation risk A rise in inflation will increase the benefits payable to Plan members, which would increase the defined benefit liability.
Longevity risk The value of the Plan deficit is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality rate among Plan members both during and after employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the members would increase the deficit in the Plan.
Salary risk The valuation of the Plan assumes a level of future salary increases based on a premium over the expected rate of inflation.
Should the salaries of Plan members increase at a higher rate then the deficit will be higher.
The risks relating to death in service payments are re-insured with an external insurance company.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries is expected to increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
However the membership is expected to reduce so that the service charge in monetary terms will gradually reduce.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Plans liabilities, obtained by the Trustee, was carried out at 31 March 2013, by Mercer, an independent actuary.
This showed that the value of the Plans liabilities on a buy-out basis in accordance with section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004 was 144.5m, with a shortfall against the assets of 67.2m.
Following the 2013 actuarial valuation, the Trustee put in place a recovery plan.
The Trustees recovery plan aims to meet the statutory funding objective within six years and five months from the date of valuation, i. e. by 31 August 2019. b Defined benefit plan Financial impact For accounting purposes the valuation at 31 March 2013 was updated to 30 September 2014 in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 revised by Mercer.

indd 162 16 12 2014 10:43 D The accounts The liabilities of the Plan are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is reflected in the liability in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the technical provisions are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the control period again allowing for future salary growth.

2.1% decrease Rate of inflation 0.1% p. a.
1.8% increase Rate of salary growth 0.1% p. a.
0.4% increase Rates of mortality 1 year of life expectancy 2.1% increase maintaining a 1% real increase in salary growth The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of an actual future change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation as some of the assumptions will be correlated.
There has been no change in the method of preparing the analysis from that adopted in previous years.
In conjunction with the Trustee, the Group has continued to conduct asset-liability reviews of the Plan.
These studies are used to assist the Trustee and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Plan.
The results of the studies are used to assist the Trustee in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the scheme deficit by providing information used to determine the investment strategy of the Plan.
There have been no changes in the processes by which the Plan manages its risks from previous periods.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2015 are 62% growth assets primarily equities, 30% bonds and 8% real estate.
The rate of employee contributions to the Plan is 5% of pensionable salaries.
Before 8 October 2013 the agreed rate of employer contributions was 26.6% of gross salaries for participating employees with an additional contribution of 1.5m per annum paid by monthly instalments.
After 8 October 2013, following the finalisation of the March 2013 valuation, employer contributions rose to 27.0% of gross salaries for participating employees, the 1.5m per annum contribution remained in place and a further additional contribution of 0.4m per annum to cover administration and life cover was agreed.
The present best estimate of the contributions to be made to the Plan by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2015 is 3.3m.
