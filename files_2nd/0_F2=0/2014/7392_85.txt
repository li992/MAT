Additionally, the Group had unutilised import and export facilities of $180 million 2013: $142 million.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
These contracts have nominal values of $100 million 2013: $128 million and have fixed interest payments at rates ranging from 1.41% to 4.34% 2013: 1.41% to 4.34% forperiods up until 2018 and have floating interest receipts at LIBOR or EURIBOR.
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of $nil 2013: liability of $1 million.
These amounts are based on fair values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges and the movement in fair value, totalling a gain of $nil 2013: gain of $3 million, has been reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The remaining outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group was committed to at the year end are held at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate fluctuations will not materially affect the financial position of the Group.
