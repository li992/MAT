ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with such interpretations by the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee as have been approved by the IASB and still remain in effect, to the extent that these have been adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where the presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendation of the SORP.
A number of new standards have been issued but are not effective for this accounting period.
These have not been adopted early and the Group does not consider that the future adoption of any new standards, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the financial statements as presented.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 30 April each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

The loss of the Company for the year ended 30 April 2014 was 22,039,000.
PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT In order better to reflect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
INCOME Dividends are recognised as income when the shareholders right to receive payment has been established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Where the Company has received its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the cash equivalent of the additional shares is recognised as income.
Dividends from overseas companies are shown gross of withholding tax.
Fixed interest returns on non-equity securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the investment.
In practical terms this means that both the coupons and the principal are adjusted to take account of accrued inflation since the bonds first issue date.
Interest income and other income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
34 Personal Assets Trust PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED EXPENSES All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.

Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed to capital.
TAXATION In accordance with the SORP, the marginal rate of tax is applied to taxable net revenue.
DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
INVESTMENTS Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract the terms of which require delivery within a period of time established by the market concerned, and are measured at fair value being the consideration payable or receivable.
Investments are designated in terms of IFRSs as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price released by the relevant investment manager.
The subsidiary is valued at fair value by the Directors on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
SHARE PREMIUM The Share Premium represents the difference between the nominal value of new Ordinary shares issued and the consideration the Company receives for these Shares.
CAPITAL REDEMPTION RESERVE The Capital Redemption Reserve represents the nominal value of Ordinary shares bought back for cancellation by the Company since authority to do this was first obtained at an Extraordinary General Meeting in April 1999.
SPECIAL RESERVE The cost of any shares bought back for cancellation is deducted from the Special Reserve, which is a distributable reserve and was created from the Share Premium Account, also following the Extraordinary General Meeting in April 1999.
CAPITAL RESERVE Gains and losses on the realisation of investments, gains and losses on the realisation of FTSE 100 Future contracts, realised exchange differences of a capital nature and returns of capital are accounted for in this Reserve.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, unrealised gains and losses on FTSE 100 Future contracts and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are also accounted for in this Reserve.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 35 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED REVENUE RESERVE Any surplus deficit arising from the revenue profit loss for the year is taken to from this Reserve.

14. BUSINESS SEGMENT The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in the business of investing in equity shares, fixed interest securities and other investments.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 41 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 15.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group holds investments in listed companies and fixed interest securities, holds cash balances and has receivables and payables.
It may from time to time also invest in FTSE 100 Futures and enter into forward currency contracts.
Cash balances are held for future investment and forward currency contracts are used to manage the exchange risk of holding foreign investments.
Further information is given in the Strategic Report for the Year to 30 April 2014 on pages 1113.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 30 April 2014 is not different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market price risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposures.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are investments, cash balances and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group did not have any exposure to any financial assets which were passed due or impaired at the year end 2013: none.
The Group is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Group has paid, or to pay for securities which the Group has delivered.
A list of pre-approved counterparties used in such transactions is maintained and regularly reviewed by the Group, and transactions must be settled on a basis of delivery against payment.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small because of the short settlement period involved and the credit quality of the brokers used.
All of the assets of the Group, other than cash deposits and receivables, are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Groups custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian might cause the Groups rights with respect to the securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Groups risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports on a regular basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings, rated A or higher, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions might cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
The Group has no concentration of credit risk and exposure is spread between counterparties.
42 Personal Assets Trust PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Market Price Risk The fair value of equity and other financial securities held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues including the market perception of future risks.
The Companys strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the Companys investment policy as outlined within the Strategic Report on pages 1113.
The Board sets policies for managing this risk and meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is fundamental to equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements in equity markets with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investment and portfolio performance are discussed in more detail in the Investment Advisers Report and the investment portfolio is set out on page 8.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Income Statement.

increase in the value of the equity exposure would have increased net return by 77,446,000.
would have had an equal but opposite effect.
These calculations are based on investment valuations at the respective balance sheet date and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company continued to use forward currency contracts during the year.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The risk of the Group not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments and the level of cash and cash equivalents ordinarily held.
The Investment Adviser reviews liquidity at the time of each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
All of the Groups financial liabilities at 30 April 2014 had a maturity period of less than three months and were repayable at the date shown on the Balance Sheet.
Interest Rate Risk Some of the financial instruments held by the Group are interest bearing.
As such, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
Floating Rate When the Group holds cash balances, such balances are held on overnight deposit accounts and call deposit accounts.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate, which at 30 April 2014 was 0.50 per cent.

44 Personal Assets Trust PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Foreign Currency Risk The Company invests in overseas securities.
2014 2013 Gross currency exposure at 30 April: 000 000 Australian Dollars 3,684 7,781 Canadian Dollars 22,272 20,725 Singapore Dollars 28,256 47,548 Swiss Francs 21,622 21,749 1 US Dollars 283,123 335,886 1 At 30 April 2014 the Sterling cost of a portion of the US Dollar denominated assets including US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities TIPS and US equities was protected by a forward currency contract.
All foreign exchange contracts in place at 30 April 2014 were due to mature within two months.
The exposure to US Dollars as shown above also includes Gold Bullion.
Foreign Currency Sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in relation to the Companys overseas monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
