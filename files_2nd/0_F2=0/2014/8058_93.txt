Financial liabilities borrowings Accounting policy Interest-bearing borrowings are recognized initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortized cost, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowings are classified as a current liability unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
