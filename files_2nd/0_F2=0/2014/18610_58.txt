Strategic report Governance Financials 125 17 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held both in trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the long-term incentive scheme LTIS, Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and SAYE schemes.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIS and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2014 was the end of the contingency period.
The profit for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the debt component of the convertible bond.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, as it is in relation to the convertible bond, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
Further details in relation to the redemption of the convertible bond are set out in note 28.
