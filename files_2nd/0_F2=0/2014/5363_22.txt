These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
Post employment benefits In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and the Group has contracted with a new industry wide pension fund for 2015 onwards.
As a result, the plan will in future be accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
Consequently, a deficit amount of $4.1 million relating to the original plan has been reversed in 2014 and the resulting credit recorded as an exceptional item.
In addition, a legacy provision of $0.8 million relating to a 2005 claim made by a group of pensioners in the Netherlands has also been reversed and credited to Group profit because the matter has now been settled.
Environmental provisions The Groups environmental provisions are calculated on a discounted basis, reflecting the time period over which spending is estimated to take place.
As a result of a decline in the underlying market interest rates that are utilised in the discount rate calculation, it was concluded that the discount rate applied to future spending should be further reduced.
This resulted in a charge of $1.9 million in 2014.
Other adjustments The liquidations of a number of legacy subsidiaries no longer involved in Group activities resulted in one time credits totalling $3.3 million being recorded in Group profit.
Taxation net credit of $53.5 million Tax related items that result in a net credit of $53.5 million have also been recorded as exceptional items.
The net credit arises from the recognition of UK advance corporation tax credits amounting to $42.0 million with an additional credit of $12.3 million in respect of further UK tax assets.
The surplus ACT arose in respect of tax paid under the prior imputation system, which allowed for ACT credits to be offset against mainstream UK tax liabilities.
The ACT not previously used under that imputation system had been written off at the time when there was no UK corporation tax liability anticipated in the foreseeable future.
It is now the Boards view that taxable profits will arise in the UK in the future and, as such, surplus ACT previously written off should now be recognised as a tax asset.
Offsetting these credits is the tax cost of $0.8 million associated with the pre-tax exceptional items listed above.

As a Group involved in overseas operations, the amount of profitability in each jurisdiction, transfer pricing regulations and local tax rate changes, will affect future tax charges.
The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 $million per cent $million per cent Profit before tax 148.2 134.3 Tax on ordinary activities at 21.5 per cent 2013: 23.25 per cent 31.9 21.5 31.2 23.3 Difference in overseas effective tax rates 10.8 7.3 10.9 8.1 Income not chargeable for tax purposes 6.8 4.6 9.8 7.3 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.5 0.4 Tax losses and other deductions 9.2 6.2 6.1 4.5 Tax rate adjustments to deferred tax 0.7 0.5 Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.3 0.2 0.9 0.6 Recognition of exceptional tax items 54.3 36.7 Tax charge and effective tax rate for the year 27.2 18.4 27.6 20.6 tax rate reflects reduction in UK corporation tax rate from 23 per cent to 21 per cent with effect from April 2014.

The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $327.9 million and Elementis Surfactants $3.1 million.
There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that reflect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs.
In this exercise a range of discount rates from 7.0 per cent to 8.5 per cent 2013: 10.2 per cent to 16.0 per cent was used.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seventeen years based on estimated growth rates of 02.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangibles represent the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem, Fancor, Watercryl and Hi-Mar acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have significant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an indefinite useful life.
Brand intangibles are tested annually for impairment using similar assumptions to the goodwill testing.
The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of 510 years.

The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups revenue.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited with counterparties by reference to the counterparties credit ratings, as defined by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $118.1 million 2013: $121.0 million of undrawn committed facilities, of which $100.0 million expires after more than one year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the US dollar and the Euro.
The Group hedges up to 100 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014 79 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 21 Financial risk management continued Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US dollar, but also Euro and GBP.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available for sale equity securities held within the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
In respect of the US schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded benefit obligations: management is assisted by external advisors in this regard.
In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed ROCE both including and excluding goodwill, as defined on page 15.
The Groups target is to achieve a ROCE including goodwill in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including executive directors hold 0.3 per cent 2013: 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares, or 1.7 per cent 2013: 2.0 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
Current dividend policy is to pay a progressive dividend of approximately one third of earnings per share before exceptional items.
Additionally if the Group finishes the year in a net balance sheet cash position, and there are no immediate investment plans for that cash, the Group may recommend an additional special dividend of up to 50 per cent of the net cash amount.
These dividend policies remain under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the circumstances and strategy of the Group.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives level 2 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables level 3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2014 2013 per cent per cent Borrowings 1.02.8 1.82.4 The Group categorises its trade and other receivables and payables, excluding derivatives, within level 3 and all other financial instruments, including cash, loans and derivatives within level 2.
At both 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 there was no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments.
22 Operating leases 2014 2013 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 3.7 3.9 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2014 2013 $million $million Within one year 0.4 0.4 In the second to fifth years inclusive 1.5 1.5 After five years 21.3 22.1 23.2 24.0 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
84 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 23 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees and executive directors.
At 31 December 2014 the main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands were of the defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and the Group has contracted with a new industry wide pension fund for 2015 onwards.
Details of an exceptional credit of $4.1 million relating to this change can be found in Note 5.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
Other employee benefit schemes included in the table below relate to 2 unfunded pension schemes and a long term service award scheme in Germany and a special benefits programme for a small number of former employees of the Eaglescliffe plant.

Contributions in 2015 are expected to be in the range $25$30 million.
Further details on agreed future payments to the UK pension scheme are included in the Finance report.

Other assets include insured annuities, an insurance fund and various swap products.
Within the UK pension scheme, the current asset allocation is approximately 46 per cent in a liability matching fund consisting of gilts fixed interest and index linked, bonds, cash and swaps and 54 per cent in an investment fund that includes various equity and equity like funds.
The aim of the trustees is to manage the risk relative to the liabilities associated with the schemes investments through a combination of diversification, inflation protection and hedging of risk currency, interest rate and inflation risk.
The US scheme currently has over 70 per cent of its asset value invested in a range of equity funds designed to target higher returns and thus reduce the pension deficit, with the balance invested in fixed income bonds and cash.
The strategy is that as the deficit reduces, a greater proportion of investments will be made into liability matching funds.
The Dutch scheme is fully insured with 2 registered insurance companies who guarantee the accrued nominal benefits, thus removing the downside risks to the Group, and who also decide the investment strategy.
The assets in the plan currently consist mainly of government bonds.

The principal assumptions used by the actuaries for the major schemes were as follows: UK US Netherlands per cent per cent per cent 2014 Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.90 N A N A Discount rate 3.40 3.65 2.25 Inflation 3.00 2.25 2.00 2013 Rate of increase in salaries 4.40 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.30 N A N A Discount rate 4.40 4.45 3.75 Inflation 3.40 2.50 2.00 The assumed life expectancies on retirement are: UK US Netherlands 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 years years years years years years Retiring at 31 December 2014 Males 22 22 21 19 21 22 Females 24 24 22 21 23 23 Retiring in 20 years Males 25 25 21 19 24 23 Females 26 26 23 21 26 24 The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 3.65 per cent 2013: 4.45 per cent per annum and a health care cost trend of 6.5 per cent 2013: 6.5 per cent per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2020 2013: 4.5 per cent.
Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
At 31 December 2014, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations for the major schemes was as follows: UK: 14 years US: 12 years The Netherlands: 19 years Sensitivity analysis The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Decreased increased by 8 per cent Rate of inflation Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased decreased by 5 per cent Rate of salary growth Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased decreased by 1 per cent Rate of mortality Increased by 1 year Increased by 4 per cent These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement of the defined obligation following a change in a particular assumption in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014 89 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 24 Share based payments The Company has several share incentive schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 amended in 2010 2010 LTIP for selected senior executives including the executive directors, business presidents and general counsel.
Awards of nil cost share options or conditional share awards are normally made annually and the maximum value of any grant to an individual is 1.5 times the CEOs basic salary.
Awards vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions over a 3 year period.
Vested awards are then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the plan.
For US participants for tax reasons the default practice is for options to be exercised at the date of vesting.
As explained in the Directors remuneration report DRR on pages 36 and 37, the Company will be submitting for shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM proposed amendments to the rules of the 2010 LTIP.
Further details can be found in the DRR as well as in the explanatory notes to the Notice of 2015 AGM accompanying this Annual Report.
For other executives, shareholders approved at the 2012 AGM an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2012 ESOS.
This scheme replaced the previous approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2003 ESOS which expired in 2013.
The last awards made under the 2003 scheme were in 2012.
Under the 2003 and 2012 ESOS, options are usually granted annually to purchase shares in the Company at an exercise price per share based on the Companys average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no discount applied.
The number of options that are granted are based on a percentage of the participants basic salary.
Options vest after 3 years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions.
Vested options are then exercisable for up to 7 years, subject to the rules of the schemes.
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is a save as you earn SAYE scheme, under which UK employees can enter into contracts to save currently up to a maximum of 500 per month with a bank or building society for a period of 3 or 5 years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The savings limit was increased in 2014 from 250 per month following the Governments announcement to raise the maximum savings limit.
The option price is the average midmarket closing share price over the 5 working days preceding the invitation date, discounted by 20 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within 6 months following the end of the savings period.
A similar scheme exists for US employees.
Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme, US employees can enter into contracts to save up to a maximum of $2,000 per month with a bank or similarly approved institution, for a period of 2 years, and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within 3 months following the end of the savings period.
Options granted under the 2 savings based schemes are held subject to the rules of the schemes.
Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2014 2013 Fair value per option pence 154.0 144.3 Expected volatility per cent 33.4 39.3 Risk free rate per cent 1.5 0.5 Expected dividend yield per cent 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 5 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $2.5 million 2013: $3.4 million related to share based payment transactions during the year.
These shadow options are included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
The weighted average exercise prices of options disclosed in the previous table were as follows: 2014 2013 Average Average exercise exercise price p price p At 1 January 80.3 48.7 Granted 133.0 120.1 Exercised 45.8 26.6 Expired 235.8 163.3 At 31 December 104.9 80.3 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of share options exercised during the year was 278 pence 2013: 256 pence.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2014 91 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 continued 25 Related party transactions The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a specified maximum amount.
The maximum amount of the guarantee is that which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

The total dividend for the year, excluding the special dividend, is 8.45 cents per share 2013: 8.07 cents and 15.40 cents per share 2013: 13.93 cents including the special dividend.
The amount payable for the final dividend and special dividend, based on the anticipated number of qualifying ordinary shares registered on the record date, is $58.7 million.

Directors remuneration is set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 35 to 54.
29 Contingent liabilities As is the case with other chemical companies, the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material outflow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
No contingent liability was considered to be reportable at 31 December 2014.
