Any impairment is expensed immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any CGU impairment loss virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
Items which may be considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, business is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis restructurings, significant onerous contract charges and asset write-downs.
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
VIU calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all CGUs that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances a Exceptional items with the exception of the impairment tests for the Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil CGUs, where FVLCD has been used.
This methodology 2014 2013 is deemed to be more appropriate for this CGU as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the underlying assets and is consistent with Year ended 31 December m m the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
Subsequently, the specific, underlying Upstream gas Provision for onerous power procurement contract 125 and oil PP&E assets and, in addition, the Groups associate investment in Nuclear and the Storage PP&E assets have also used the FVLCD Exceptional items included within gross profit 125 impairment methodology.
UK power generation assets have used the VIU impairment methodology.
Further details of the approach and assumptions i 1,189 used in the VIU calculations are provided in note S2.
Impairment of Centrica Energy exploration and production assets 699 ii Impairment of UK power generation assets 535 FVLCD discount rate and cash-flow assumptions iii Impairment of Nuclear investment 214 Centrica Energy Gas Upstream gas and oil production Impairment of UK gas storage assets and associated provision for onerous capacity contracts 240 An impairment charge of 1,189 million has been recorded within exceptional items for Centrica Energy exploration and production assets.
The associated recoverable amounts net of decommissioning costs of 552 million are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Gain on disposal of Texas gas-fired power stations note 12 c 219 FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas and oil production and development assets, 122 Gain on disposal of Ontario home services business note 12 c net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash 1,597 939 flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Exceptional items included within Group operating profit 1,597 1,064 Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
Note S6 provides additional detail on the active Taxation on exceptional items note 9 436 397 period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number Net exceptional items after taxation 1,161 of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price 667 i Impairment of Centrica Energy exploration and production assets has been recognised predominantly due to declining gas and oil prices.
The Group recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each of 1,189 million post-tax charge 712 million in the Centrica Energy Gas segment, which included a pre-tax impairment charge of 309 million post-tax charge 265 million on the Trinidad field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculation for the first three years are based on the and Tobago gas assets including 70 million of goodwill, a pre-tax impairment charge of 837 million post-tax charge 410 million on UK and Norwegian gas and oil assets and a pre-tax Groups Board-approved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
impairment charge of 43 million post-tax charge 37 million on Canadian upstream assets.
Further details on how the recoverable amounts of fields are calculated on a fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD basis are provided below.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 9% 2013: 9% to determine the FVLCD.
The discount rate ii The Groups larger UK gas-fired power stations, Langage, Humber and Killingholme were classified as held for sale on 8 May 2014.
The Group reassessed the likelihood of the value of these assets being recovered principally through a divestment at 31 December 2014 and, since the disposal was no longer considered to be highly probable, the assets have been reclassified and inflation rate used in the FVLCD calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described in note S2, out of held for sale, see note 3 for further details.
A pre-tax impairment charge of 371 million post-tax charge of 297 million has been recognised in the Centrica Energy Power segment with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
including 17 million of goodwill, predominantly due to declining forecast capacity market auction prices and clean spark spread prices together with other changes in assumptions following information gained during the disposal process.
A further 13 million charge 10 million net of taxation was recognised in other comprehensive income to reverse previous upwards valuations The valuation of Centrica Energy Gas goodwill is particularly sensitive to the price assumptions made in the impairment calculations.
To illustrate of the impaired assets.
The Group also recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of 164 million post-tax 162 million on its other UK gas-fired power stations based on the same assumptions.
Further details on how the recoverable amount of the assets is calculated on a VIU basis are provided below.
this, the price assumptions for gas and oil have been varied by 10%.
Changes in price generate different production profiles and in some cases iii The Group recognised an impairment charge of 214 million post-tax charge of 214 million on its Nuclear investment within the Centrica Energy Power segment due to declining forecast the date that an asset ceases production and this has been considered in the sensitivity analysis.
Otherwise, all other operating costs, life of field power prices and capacity market auction prices.

capital expenditure and abandonment expenditure assumptions remain unchanged.
For exploration and production assets, an increase in gas and oil prices of 10% would reverse 142 million of post-tax impairment charges recorded at the year end.
A reduction of 10% would give rise to further post-tax impairments of the underlying exploration and production assets of 254 million and an impairment of goodwill of 251 million Certain re-measurements are the fair value movements on energy contracts entered into to meet the future needs of our customers or to sell in the UK Norway Netherlands CGU.

These contracts are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued, and are therefore separately identified in the current period and reflected in business Centrica Energy Power Nuclear performance in future periods when the underlying transaction or asset impacts the Group Income Statement.
An impairment charge of 214 million has been recorded within exceptional items for the Groups associate investment in Nuclear.

To illustrate this, sensitivities were performed at the year end to vary the power price assumptions Net re-measurements after taxation 771 284 in the Groups internal valuation model by 10%.
An increase in power prices of 10%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in the reversal of the impairment of 214 million recorded at the year end and would provide headroom of 310 million.
A reduction of 10% would give The Group is generally a net buyer of commodity, procuring gas and power for our customers.

Independent valuations The Registered Pensions Schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the Registered Pensions Schemes at 31 March 2012 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan at 1 August 2014.
These have been updated to 31 December 2014 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19: Employee Benefits 2011.
Investments have been valued for this purpose at market value.
Governance The Registered Pension Schemes are managed by trustee companies whose boards consist of both company-nominated and member-nominated Directors.
Each scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund CCCIF, which holds the majority of the combined assets of the participating schemes.
The board of the CCCIF is currently comprised of nine Directors: three independent Directors, three Directors appointed by Centrica plc including the Chairman and one Director appointed by each of the three participating schemes.
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, Centrica plc and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit pension scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme-specific statutory funding objective.
This approach was first adopted for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006, and has been reflected in subsequent valuations, including the 31 March 2012 valuations.

Post retirement benefits b Risks c Accounting assumptions The Registered Pension Schemes expose the Group to the following risks: The accounting assumptions for the Registered Pension Schemes have been given below: Asset volatility Major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation 2014 2013 31 December % % The pension liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields: if the growth in plan assets is lower than this, this will create an actuarial loss within other equity.
The CCCIF is responsible for managing the assets of each scheme in line with the liability-related Rate of increase in employee earnings: investment objectives that have been set by the trustees of the schemes, and invests in a diversified portfolio of assets.
The schemes are relatively 1.7 Subject to cap 1.7 young in nature the schemes opened in 1997 on the formation of Centrica plc on demerger from BG plc formerly British Gas plc, and only took Other 3.0 3.3 on liabilities in respect of active employees.
Therefore, the CCCIF holds a significant proportion of return-seeking assets: such assets are generally Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 3.3 expected to provide a higher return than corporate bonds, but result in greater exposure to volatility and risk in the short-term.
The investment Rate of increase in deferred pensions: objectives are to achieve a target return above a return based on a portfolio of gilts, subject to a maximum volatility ceiling.
If there have been advantageous asset movements relative to liabilities above a set threshold, then fide-risking is undertaken, and as a consequence the return target In line with CPI capped at 2.5% 1.9 2.3 and maximum volatility ceiling are reduced.
Whilst there is no explicit target for the level or rate of fide-risking, the pace of fide-risking is regularly 3.0 In line with RPI 3.3 monitored and is typically restricted to once a quarter.
Discount rate 3.9 4.6 Interest rate The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination of standard A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the net present value of the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that the duration of the liabilities is longer than average for typical UK pension schemes, resulting in a relatively higher exposure to interest rate risk.
actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
The longevity assumptions for members in normal health are as follows: Inflation 2014 2013 Pensions in deferment, pensions in payment and pensions accrued under the career average schemes increase in line with the Retail Price Index RPI Life expectancy at age 65 for a member Male Female Male Female and the Consumer Price Index CPI.
Therefore scheme liabilities will increase if inflation is higher than assumed, although in some cases caps are in 31 December Years Years Years Years place to limit the impact of significant movements in inflation.
During the year the Group initiated a pension increase exchange PIE.
This PIE offered Currently aged 65 22.7 25.1 22.9 25.3 retired pensioners the option to receive a higher current pension in return for giving up certain future increases linked to RPI.
A past service credit of Currently aged 45 24.4 27.0 24.7 27.3 10 million arose in the year in relation to those pensioners who accepted the PIE.
Longevity The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of scheme members and their surviving spouses: therefore increases in life The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuations of the pension schemes.
expectancy will result in an increase in the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that there is comparatively little observable Reasonably possible changes as at 31 December to one of the actuarial assumptions would have affected the scheme liabilities as set out below: mortality data to assess the rates of mortality experienced by the schemes, and means that the schemes liabilities will be paid over a long period of 2014 2013 time, making it particularly difficult to predict the life expectancy of the current membership.
Furthermore, pension payments are subject to inflationary Impact of changing material assumptions Indicative effect Indicative effect increases, resulting in a higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

With regard to Morecambe the security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the associated gas field falls below a predetermined proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant legal decommissioning notices in respect of the relevant fields have been revoked.
Following legislation being executed, the UK Government is now signing contracts Decommissioning Relief Deeds DRDs with industry, providing certainty on decommissioning tax relief via the tax code or DRD.
These deeds should permit industry to move to post-tax Decommissioning Security Agreements DSAs, cutting the cost of these and freeing capital for investment.
Centrica now has a signed DRD, discussions are ongoing on moving to a post-tax DSA, whilst we continue to analyse options to update the South Morecambe DSA.
Security for Statfjord and Kvitebjorn is slightly different in this respect as it was provided to the previous owners as part of the acquisition of these fields.

Following the exploration and appraisal phase, if the Group elects to continue into the development phase, a further contingent consideration of 60 million will become payable.
There are no other material contingent liabilities.

Summary of significant accounting policies Employee share schemes Business combinations and goodwill The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 81, under which it makes The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method at the point the Group gains control over a business as defined by equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant IFRS 3 Revised 2008 : Business combinations.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together at the date of exchange, of other assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest, and adjusted for control of the acquiree.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.

Purchased renewable obligation certificates are recognised initially at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for the renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period.

The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured.
All other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and maintenance, is expensed as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other PP&E, with the exception of upstream production assets see above, are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings Up to 50 years Plant Five to 20 years Equipment and vehicles Three to 10 years Power stations and wind farms Up to 30 years Gas storage Up to 40 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned assets, or where shorter, the lease term.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities because the cost of procuring gas Pressurised water reactor PWR and electricity to serve its downstream customers varies with wholesale commodity prices.
The risk is primarily that market prices for commodities Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding procurement cost is fixed, thereby are capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.

Financial risk management ii Proprietary energy trading The Groups proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken on with the intent of benefiting in the short-term from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.
The Group conducts its trading The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, activities in the over-the-counter market and through exchanges in the UK, North America and continental Europe.
The Group is exposed to currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management processes are designed to identify, commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with manage and mitigate these risks.

The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading Further detail on the Groups overall risk management processes is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties activities.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding period.
The carrying value of energy contracts on pages 40 to 45. used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2014 is disclosed in note 19.
Financial risk management is overseen by the GFRMC according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Commodity price risk As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR calculation.

In 2014 there have been fewer credit rating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial instruments in foreign downgrades of financial institutions and European energy majors, than in 2013.
The Group continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2014 are all constant.

At the same time, the non-controlling interest subscribed for a further C$215 million 119 million of capital in the partnership for cash.
The cash was used to repay, in part, the Groups partnership loan to CQ Energy Canada Partnership.
Group and non-controlling interests partnership loans of C$144 million and C$239 million 80 million and 132 million respectively were then converted to capital, leaving Group and non-controlling interests partnership loans of C$30 million and C$20 million 17 million and 11 million respectively outstanding.
From a Group perspective, the gas and liquid assets have not been disposed of, since they remain controlled by a subsidiary of the Group.
Instead, this is a transaction with the non-controlling interest who has paid C$215 million 119 million for a share of additional Group assets.
This payment, together with the conversion of C$239 million 132 million partnership loans, and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax liability of C$59 million 32 million since the non-controlling interest is now responsible for 40% of the tax consequences of the contributed assets, has resulted in an increase in the non-controlling interest of C$513 million 283 million.
In the underlying financial information of the partnership, predecessor accounting has been followed.
