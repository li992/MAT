Financial statements 169 d Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2014, the Group recognised total derivative assets of 76 million 2013: 6 million and derivative liabilities of 6 million 2013: 5 million.
Of these amounts, 70 million 2013: 1 million mature within oneyear and the balance thereafter.
The notional amount of 1,433 million 2013: 980 million is the aggregate face value of all derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and therefore do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Of the 1,433 million 2013: 980 million aggregate notional amount, 739 million 2013:645million relates to the economic hedging of foreign exchange exposures on short-term intercompany funding balances, which are fully eliminated on consolidation.
Hedging Cash flow hedges The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
The fair value gains losses are reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit and loss in the period when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
For non-current non-financial assets, these gains losses are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same useful life as the cost of the asset.
There were no fair value gains losses reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve during the current or prior year.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss arising on cash flow hedges for both the years presented.
