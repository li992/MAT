Background to remuneration policy The Company has a well-established and clear remuneration policy which, in the view of the Committee, has made an important contribution to the success of the Company over a sustained period.
This can be summarised as providing at or below the median of market levels of fixed pay but with the opportunity to earn upper quartile levels of remuneration if the executives deliver superior returns for shareholders.
Executive remuneration packages are structured so that they: are aligned to the Companys strategy to promote its long-termsuccess: are aligned with the interests of shareholders: are competitive and provide a very clear bias to variable paywith stretching and rigorous performance measures andconditions: do not promote unacceptable behaviours or encourage unacceptable risk taking: and take into account Company-wide pay and employment conditions.
The Directors remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee presents the Directors remuneration policy, which will be put to a binding vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 January 2015 and, subject to shareholder approval, will take immediate effect.
TheDirectors remuneration policy has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations.
Future policy table 3.1 Executive directors The following table explains the different elements of remuneration we pay to our executive directors: Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures Base salary This is the basic element While base salaries are reviewed each year, the Base salary is paid monthly in cash of pay and reflects the Companys policy is not automatically to award an Base salaries are reviewed annually with any individuals role and inflationary increase.

While the Committee applies judgement rather than setting salaries by reference to a fixed percentile position, its general approach is to constrain base salaries to a median or lower level While the Committees general approach is to keep salaries to a relatively low level, and, in the normal course, would not expect salary increases to be higher than those for other head office staff, given the need for a formal cap, the Committee has limited the maximum salary which it may award to the median of salaries of CEOs in the top half of FTSE 250 companies even though, in practice, the Committee would normally seek to keep it below the median of this benchmark WH Smith PLC 32 Annual report and accounts 2014 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report Element and purpose Policy and opportunity Operation and performance measures Benefits To provide other benefits Provide market competitive benefits in kind Benefits received by executive directors valued by the recipient comprise a car allowance, private medical The Company may periodically amend the benefits which assist them in insurance and life assurance available to staff.

Payments from existing awards The Committee believes that EPS is the most appropriate performance target for awards made to participants under the Stephen Clarke and Robert Moorhead are eligible to receive CIP as it focuses senior managers on real profit growth which is payment from awards made before the approval and strongly aligned with value creation and the Companys strategic implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report.

However, it does take into account information provided by the Group HR Director and FIT, the Committees independent remuneration consultants, on the appropriateness and competitiveness of the Companys remuneration structures.

The potential total rewards are based on the Companys remuneration policy.
Group CEO Stephen Clarke CFO and COO Robert Moorhead 000 000 3,110 LTIP CIP Annual Bonus 2,121 55% Total Fixed Pay 1,463 56% 1,023 33% 25% 33% 614 25% 22% 465 22% 42% 20% 100% 45% 22% 100% Minimum On-target Maximum Minimum On-target Maximum Valuation assumptions 1.
The minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits, being the only elements of the remuneration package not linked to performance.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus the threshold award opportunity for the CIP at 40 per cent of base salary for Stephen Clarke and 32.5 per cent ofbase salary for Robert Moorhead: the threshold award opportunity for the LTIP is 60 per cent of base salary we have assumed that TSR performance and dividend growth are at median : and the target level of performance for the annual bonus plan is 48 per cent of maximum annual bonus.
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus the maximum award opportunity for the CIP at 160 per cent of base salary for Stephen Clarke 160 per cent has been used as it will be the ongoing level, the proposed grant in October 2014 will be set at 150% as it is based on the bonus opportunity for the preceding year and 130 per cent of base salary for Robert Moorhead: the maximum award opportunity for the LTIP is 200 per centofbase salary: and the maximum level of performance for the annual bonus plan is160per cent of base salary for Stephen Clarke and 130 per cent of base salary for RobertMoorhead.
3.4 Recruitment remuneration policy The Companys recruitment remuneration policy aims to give theCommittee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment andpromotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver the Companys strategic objectives.
The starting point for the Committee will be to look at the general policy for executive directors as set out above and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Although the Regulations provide that, technically, the caps on fixed pay within the general policy will not apply on a recruitment, the Committee would seek not to exceed those caps in practice.
In addition, ignoring any special buy-out arrangements which may prove to be necessary, the annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation arrangements will operate consistently including the maximum award levels within the limits as set out in the Future policy table in Section 3.1 Executive directors on pages 31 to 34.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses and legal fees as it considers to be appropriate.
Where it is necessary to make a recruitment-related pay award to an external candidate to buy-out entitlements under a previous employers plan, the Company will not pay more than the Committee considers to be necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure.
It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make such awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing annual and equity-based pay structures at the Company in order to secure a candidate.
Any buy-out awards for external appointments, whether under the bonus plan, LTIP, CIP or otherwise, will be capped at the commercial value of the amount forfeited and will take account of the nature, time-horizons and performance requirements of those awards.
In particular, the Committee will seek to ensure that any awards being forfeited which were subject to outstanding performance requirements other than where substantially complete are bought-out with replacement requirements and any awards with service requirements are, again, bought out with similar terms.
However, exceptionally the Committee may relax those obligations where it considers it to be in the interests of shareholders and those factors are, in the view of the Committee, equally reflected in some other way, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited.
WH Smith PLC 36 Annual report and accounts 2014 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report 3.5 Contracts of service and policy on payment for lossofoffice The contract dates and notice periods for each executive director are as follows: Notice period Notice period Date of contract by Company by director Stephen Clarke 18 April 2012 12 months 12 months Robert Moorhead 1 December 2008 12 months 9 months Stephen Clarkes service contract provides for notice of 12months from either party, permits summary dismissal with no compensation in appropriate cases, has no special provisions in the event of a change of control and limits the maximum sum due on termination to base salary only for the notice period.
Witheffect from 1 September 2014, Robert Moorhead no longer has the benefit of a change of control clause in his contract.
It is envisaged that any new executive director would join with a contract which is no more favourable than that summarised in respect of Stephen Clarke except that, in exceptional circumstances, the initial notice period required from the Company may be up to 18months provided this reduces to 12months within 12 months of appointment.
In practice, the facts surrounding a termination may be complex and do not always fit neatly into defined categories for good or bad leavers.
Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable treatment on a termination having regard toall of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time.
This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the annual bonus plan and the CIP and LTIP.
Thepotential treatments on termination under these plans aresummarised below.

All payments made to the Chairman are determined by the Committee.
The Committee undertook a review of the fee paid to the Chairman in January 2014 and, after taking advice from FIT, its external independent remuneration adviser, agreed that the Chairmans annual fee should be increased from 165,000 to 200,000 with effect from 1 February 2014.
The Chairman does not participate in any bonus or share plans.
The fees paid to non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors being the Board excluding the non-executive directors themselves and are paid in cash.
The levels are set to take into account the required time commitment and the fee payments for non-executive directors of similar organisations.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or share plans.
The Chairman and the executive members of the Board undertook a review of non-executive pay in January 2014 and it was agreed that the fees paid to non-executive directors should be increased from 1 February 2014.
The current fees payable to the Chairman and the non-executive directors are set out on page 38.
