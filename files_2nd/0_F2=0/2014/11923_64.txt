The Groups portfolio of rate derivatives is diversified by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges significantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
The sensitivity of the portfolio to changes in market rates is set out in note 19.

Offset arrangements in respect of cash balances are shown in note 17.
Counterparty exposure from all derivatives is managed, together with that from deposits and bank account balances, within credit limits that reflect published credit ratings and by reference to other market measures e. g. market prices for credit default swaps to ensure that there is no significant risk to any one counterparty.
No single derivative transaction had a market value positive or negative at the balance sheet date that exceeded 3% of the Groups consolidated total equity.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the Group has reviewed all of its material contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.
