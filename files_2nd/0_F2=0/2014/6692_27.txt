This scheme is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.

Defined benefit During the year ended 28 June 2014, the Company participated in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
Previously, the section had been effectively closed to new entrants, however existing members continued to build up further Final Salary benefits.
However, during the year ended 28 June 2014, the Group commenced a formal consultation process with existing members and their representatives to close the defined benefit section to future accrual and to offer members the opportunity to join the defined contribution section instead.
On 31 March 2014, the defined benefit section of the Go-Ahead plan was closed to future accrual for all members.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2012 and was updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 revised in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 28 June 2014, 29 June 2013 and 30 June 2012.
Up until the closure of the scheme to future accruals on 31 March 2014, the contributions paid to the scheme were paid in line with the schedule of contributions.
The total net assets and liabilities of the scheme have been brought onto the Parent Company balance sheet on transition to FRS101.
The Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The following disclosures provide details of the entire defined benefit scheme.
