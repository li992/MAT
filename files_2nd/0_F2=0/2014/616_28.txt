Share-based payments 10.1 Accounting policy The Company principally operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
10.2 Profit and loss account recognition The Company operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements, the main features of which are described on pages 71 to 75 of the Remuneration Report.
The total expense recognised in the year was 0.3m 2013: 0.2m.

Contingent liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies withinits Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31December 2014 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 160.3m 2013: 161.8m which includes 155.3m 2013: 154.5m of drawings under the syndicated debt facility.
Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, eitherindividually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or resultsofoperations.

Transactions between related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.
