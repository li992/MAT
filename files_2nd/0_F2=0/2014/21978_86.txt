112 Additional information ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specic items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not dened under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP measures we use are: the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit, as well as in underlying operating costs excluding transit, the investment in BT Sport and the non-cash increase in the pensions operating charge: reported and adjusted EBITDA: and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specic items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specic items.
Specic items are those that in managements judgement need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specic, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the BT Group plc Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups underlying financial performance.
Items which have been considered to be specic items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence include disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historic insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
Specic items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and operating costs Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs are measures which seek to reect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specic items.
We focus on the trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, as transit trafc is low-margin and is signicantly affected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the increase in reported revenue and decrease in reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the increase in underlying revenue and increase in underlying operating costs excluding transit, is set out below.

Additional information 113 EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
EBITDA is dened as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is dened as EBITDA before specic items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash ow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Within the lines of business we may also consider our performance using an underlying EBITDA measure, which additionally excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals and foreign exchange.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
A reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Net debt This measure is applied in the context of BT Group plcs financial statements and is referred to in these financial statements.
Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured as the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Our net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash ows that should arise when our financial instruments mature.
We adjust these cash ows to reect hedged risks that are re-measured under fair value hedges, as well as for the impact of the effective interest method.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
Net debt is a measure of BT Group plcs consolidated net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the BT Group plcs consolidated cash position and its indebtedness.
There are material limitations in the use of alternative performance measures and the use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
BT Group plcs management consider net debt to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, and a reconciliation is provided in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

New Articles of Association were adopted on 5 August 2010, largely to take account of changes in UK company law brought about by the Companies Act 2006 2006 Act.
Under the 2006 Act, the Memorandum of Association serves a more limited role as historical evidence of the formation of the company.
Since August 2010, the provisions in relation to objects in BTs Memorandum are deemed to form part of BTs Articles, and have been deleted from those Articles because of shareholders passing a resolution to this effect.
Under the 2006 Act, BTs objects are unrestricted.
Articles a Voting rights In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a holder of shares and a member is, in either case, the person registered in the companys register of members as the holder of the relevant shares.
Subject to certain restrictions, on a show of hands, every member present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of members is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman of the meeting or by any member at the meeting who is entitled to vote or the members proxy.
b Changes in capital The company may by ordinary resolution: i consolidate, or consolidate and then divide, all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount than its existing shares: ii divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of a smaller amount and the resolution may decide that, as between the shares resulting from the division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others.
The company may also: i buy back its own shares: and ii by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account.
c Dividends The companys members can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution, in addition to the powers of the Board, but no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board.
Dividends must be paid out of profits available for distribution.
If the directors consider that the profits of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim and final dividends.
Fixed dividends will be paid on any class of share on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for 10 years after it was declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and belong to the company again unless the directors decide otherwise.
d Distribution of assets on winding up If the company is wound up whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of a court or by a court the liquidator can, with the authority of a special resolution passed by the members, divide among the members all or any part of the assets of the company.
This applies whether the assets consist of property of one kind or different kinds.
For this purpose, the liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers fair on any property and decide how the division is carried out between members or different groups of members.
The liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees upon trusts for the benefit of members which the liquidator decides.
The liquidation of the company can then be nalised and the company dissolved.
No past or present members can be compelled to accept any shares or other property under BTs Articles which could give them a liability.
Additional information 117 Articles continued e Transfer of shares Shares of the company may only be transferred in writing and either in the usual form or another form approved by the Board.

The directors may be paid their expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The directors can decide whether to provide pensions, annual payments or other allowances or benets to any people including people who are or were directors of the company.
The Board can decide to extend these arrangements to relations or dependants of, or people connected to these people.

If the legislation allows, a director can vote and be counted in the quorum on a resolution concerning a contract: I in which the director has an interest of which the director is not aware: or which cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conict of interest: II in which the director has an interest only because the director is a holder of shares, debentures or other securities of BT, or by reason of any other interest in or through BT: III which involves the giving of any security, guarantee or indemnity to the director or any other person for: money lent or obligations incurred by the director or by any other person at the request of or for the benefit of BT or the benefit of any of its subsidiary undertakings: or a debt or other obligation which is owed by BT or any of its subsidiary undertakings to that other person if the director has taken responsibility for all or any part of that debt or obligation by giving a guarantee, security or indemnity: IV where BT or any of its subsidiary undertakings is offering any shares, debentures or other securities for subscription or purchase to which the director is or may be entitled to participate as a holder of BT or BT Group plc securities: or where the director will be involved in the underwriting or sub-underwriting: V relating to any other company in which the director has an interest, directly or indirectly including holding a position in that company or is a shareholder, creditor, employee or otherwise involved in that company.
These rights do not apply if the director owns 1% or more of that company or of the voting rights in that company: VI relating to an arrangement for the benefit of BT employees or former employees of BT or any of BTs subsidiary undertakings which only gives the directors the same benets that are generally given to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates: VII relating to BT buying or renewing insurance for any liability for the benefit of directors or for the benefit of persons who include directors: VIII relating to the giving of indemnities in favour of directors: IX relating to the funding of expenditure by any director or directors: on defending criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings or actions against the director or the directors: in connection with an application to the court for relief: or on defending the director or the directors in any regulatory investigations: or which enables any director or directors to avoid incurring expenditure as described in this paragraph: and X in which the directors interest, or the interest of directors generally, has been authorised by an ordinary resolution.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the members can by passing an ordinary resolution ratify any particular contract or arrangement carried out in breach of those provisions.
j Retirement of directors No person will be prevented from being or becoming a director simply because that person has reached the age of 70.
118 Additional information Articles continued k Directors borrowing powers To the extent that the legislation and BTs Articles allow, the Board may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its business, property and assets present and future and to issue debentures and other securities, and give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or another person.
Further note on certain activities During 2013 14, certain of the groups non-US subsidiaries or other non-US entities conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, certain countries identied by the US Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US sanctions.
These activities, which generally relate to the provision of communications services to embassies and diplomatic missions of US-allied governments, other CPs, news organisations, multinational corporations and other customers that require global communications connectivity, are insignicant to the groups financial condition and results of operations.
Under Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13 r to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are required to disclose whether BT or any of its afliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or certain designated individuals or entities.
Disclosure is required even when the activities were conducted outside the US by non-US entities and even when they were conducted in compliance with applicable law.
Our disclosures for 2013 14, which remain unchanged from 2012 13, are below.
HM Treasury approval was granted on 31 October 2012 for authorisation to receive 75,000 euros from Telecommunication Infrastructure Company TIC, in Iran.
