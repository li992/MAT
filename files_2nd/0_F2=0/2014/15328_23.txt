Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Performance Governance Financial statements Other information TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies and basis of preparation Basis of preparation TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
These financial statements therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and investments.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest million, because that is the currency of the principal economic environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control passed to or was relinquished bythe Group.
Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint ventures to bring accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Details of the considerations undertaken by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officers statement.
Accounting policies The Groups principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below.
Where an accounting policy isspecific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, whether these are effective in the current or later years.
In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the performance of the Group.
Revenue Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit generated from the provision offixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services.
All such revenue is recognised as the services are provided: line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates: voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate: usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service: promotional discounts are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period subject to an adjustment for in-contract churn: and data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance obligations.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
When the Group sells a number of products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element based on their relative fair values.
The amount of revenue the Group recognises for delivered elements is limited to the cash received.
Subscriber acquisition costs Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as device costs.
51 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued Foreign currency translation and transactions Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised inthe financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained.
Unhedged transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement has been applied in the current and preceding financial year by marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss through other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.
The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows: Average Closing 2014 2013 2014 2013 Euro 1.19 1.23 1.21 1.19 United States Dollar 1.60 1.58 1.67 1.52 Where a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
Leases Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are amortised through the income statement over the period of the lease.
Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that the rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals.
The remaining gainor loss is recognised within operating expenses in the year inwhich the sale is completed.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits consists of cash in hand.
Trade payables Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Loans and other borrowings Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, bank overdrafts and loans from related parties.
These are initially measured at fair value which is equal to cost at inception and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.
Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held bythe trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.

Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial derivatives isgoverned by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with theGroups risk management strategy.
Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement.
TheGroup does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.
The Group designates these as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately inthe income statement.
Measurement The financial instruments included on the Groups balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below: Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset orliability either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of  The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.
Whilst every effort ismade to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have a material impact.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out in more detail in the related notes: tax note 7 : exceptional items note 9 : impairment of goodwill note 11 : capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets notes 11 and 12 : impairment of assets notes 11 and 12 : and trade receivables note 16.
Application of significant new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income and IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement became effective in the current reporting period.
These new and revised standards and interpretations have no material impact on the Group.
In addition, the Group has elected to early adopt IAS36 revised Impairment of Assets IAS36, which is endorsed by the EU, but not effective until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The amendments to IAS36 enhance the disclosure requirements arising when recoverable amounts have been determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal.
They also limit the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU to periods in which an impairment loss has been recognised or reverses.
We have chosen to adopt the amendments early, as allowed by the standard, with effect from 1 April 2013.
53 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued Future accounting developments At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following significant standards and interpretations that have not been applied inthese financial statements were in issue, but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 amended Investment Entities IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and FinancialLiabilities IAS 39 amended Novation of Derivatives and Continuation ofHedge Accounting IFRIC 21 Levies The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group infutureperiods, except as follows: IFRS 9 will impact the: measurement and disclosure of financial instruments: and disclosure of interest the Group has in other entities.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review hasbeen completed.
Segmental reporting Accounting policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to allocate resources.
The Group has identified the Board as its chief operating decision maker.
The Board considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of resources.
Accordingly the Group has one operating segment.

55 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fairvalue at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal, non-market performance criteria for example, EPS targets and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those with external, market performance criteria for example, TSR targets.
For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately.
If a scheme is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.
Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long term incentive plans.
Totheextent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans.
Charges are also recognised on loans provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities: to the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment no cost has been recognised in respect of the options granted before November 2002.
Group share schemes The Groups share schemes are the Discretionary Share Option Plan DSOP and Save-As-You-Earn scheme SAYE.
In addition, the Group has a number of legacy CPW schemes.
In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes and legacy CPW schemes has been presented.
This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of 2.67 2013: 1.98.
For the CPW legacy schemes, there is no IFRS 2 charge in the current year 2013:1m.
The disclosures are limited to the dilutive effect on EPS and the number of options outstanding at the end of the year.
In September 2013, the remaining 40% of the TTG VES and the CPW TTG VES vested.
Further information is set out in section vi of this note.

59 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5.
Share-based payments continued TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC schemes continued vi TTG VES and CPW TTG VES The TTG VES enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted as relevant for changes in invested capital since that date.
The incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7% on this invested capital.
The Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase A shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating business.
The CPW TTG VES enables participants to share in 2.24% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted for the change in the Groups opening share price since 1 April 2009.
In line with the TTG VES, the invested capital is adjusted for changes in invested capital since 1 April 2009 and the incremental value ismeasured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7%.
For the vesting in September 2013, this is capped at the September 2012 amount.
Therules of both schemes have been approved by shareholders.
The Groups opening share price for this purpose represents an allocation of the share price of CPW at that rate, based on the market capitalisation of the Group and Carphone Warehouse Group PLC in the five days following demerger.
CPW advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase C shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating businesses.
The Group has an obligation to acquire the A and C shares if performance conditions are met, to provide to participants the share of value described above.
The fair value of the schemes, which has performance targets based on the growth of the market capitalisation of the Group, was estimated atthe date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to initially value the A shares and then a Black Scholes model to calculate the option value.
Themodel combines the valuation price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the expected value of the Group at the date of grant discounted for the lack of marketability of the shares.
On 16 September 2013, the Groups Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of these VES schemes including the 5% TSR requirement had been satisfied meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise the remaining 40% of their VESoptions.
On19 November 2013, the participants options were acquired by the Company for new ordinary shares in the Company and cash, resulting inacash outflow of 15m.
Thenet issue of 23.7 million shares in the Company was at a price of 2.78 per share, being the average closing price of the Companys shares over the five working days from 12 to 18 November 2013.
The settlement of the schemes resulted in a net movement inreserves of 12m being therecognition of share premium of 66m and a 78m debit in retained earnings and other reserves.
The 78m debitto reserves represents atotal cash outflow of 15m and the value of new PLC shares issued of 66m net of the repayment of the associated VES loans, interest and areduction in the Groups liability to settle the schemes.
Finance costs and investment revenue Finance costs are analysed as follows: 2014 2013 m m Interest on bank loans and overdrafts 16 14 Facility fees and similar charges 4 4 Unwinding of discount on provisions 1 20 19 During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Group refinanced its revolving credit facility and paid 7m in respect of facility fees.
This is being amortised over the expected life of the loan and is included within facility fees and similar charges above.
Taxation Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can beutilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, inwhich case it is recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions fortheforeseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

On2July 2013, a reduction in the UK statutory rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted, bringing the tax rate down from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Accordingly, the tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2014 take account of these changes.
This has resulted in a tax charge to the income statement as the value of the Groups tax assets has been reduced.
The asset also reflects the annual recognition of a further tranche of the tax losses acquired with Tiscali UK Limited, including Video Networks Limited, based on the Groups rolling forecast.
This is in line with the Groups agreement with HMRC in 2012.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had unused tax losses of 702m 2013: 759m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 39m 2013: 40m has been recognised in respect of 197m 2013: 172m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 505m 2013: 587m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Dividends Accounting policy Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received.
Final dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.
The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders: 2014 2013 m m Ordinary dividends Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 of 6.40p per ordinary share 56 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 3.45p per ordinary share 31 Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 6.95p per ordinary share 62 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 4.00p per ordinary share 37 Total ordinary dividends 99 87 The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 8.00p per ordinary share on approximately 921 million ordinary shares 74m was approved by the Board on 14 May 2014 and has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2014.
The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in the analysis above.

Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information Accounting policy Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore, judgement is required to determine whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above.
Determining whether an item is exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from the Groups other critical accounting judgements where the basis for judgement surrounds estimation.

a Operating efficiencies Phase III Making TalkTalk Simpler During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group has continued a review of its operating structure to look for further opportunities to drive process and efficiency improvements over the medium term.
The initiatives that form part of the Groups Making TalkTalk Simpler programme, which were implemented in the year ended 31 March 2014, were continued restructuring of the systems and processes in TalkTalk Business to remove duplication and better align the sales and service model forfuture growth: a review and consolidation of the outsourcing partners and rebalancing of the Groups on-shore footprint: and a proactive initiative to replace routers to align the estate across the Group.
This has resulted in redundancy, dual running, property, system, project management and router replacement costs.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2014 was 20m 2013: 7m.
A total taxation credit of 5m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 2m.
b Operating efficiencies Phase II Consumer contact centre rationalisation On 24 April 2012, the Group announced the second stage of its contact centre rationalisation.
This resulted in consolidating and outsourcing operations in Preston and Northampton.
Costs were incurred in respect of redundancy, dual running and consultancy.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2014 was nil 2013: 11m.
A total taxation credit of nil has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 3m.
c Wholesale Ethernet services overcharges In December 2012, Ofcom determined that BT had overcharged the Group for certain wholesale Ethernet services.
Accordingly, BT was required to make repayments to the Group for these overcharges.
A total of 3m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 27m.
A total taxation charge of 1m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 6m.
d Revenue HMRC VAT ruling In September 2013, a change to a previously agreed VAT treatment in relation to prompt payment discounts was enforced by HMRC with immediate effect.
Theincremental VAT relating to this change in treatment has been paid by the Group: however, the Group has sought external legal advice on the HMRC decision and has subsequently appealed the decision to the VAT Tribunal.
Due to both the unexpected nature, pending appeal and short timeframe given to comply, a total of 5m has been recognised in exceptional items in the year ended 31March2014 2013: nil.
The tax credit was 1m in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: nil.
e Amortisation of acquisition intangibles An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of 21m was incurred in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 52m.

Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The Group has two CGUs Consumer and TalkTalk Business.
For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
Thevalue in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, touse to calculate present values.
64 Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Performance Governance Financial statements Other information TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014 11.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued a Goodwill continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired: this review is performed at a CGU level.
Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
The future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UKs long term growth rate.
This is discounted by the CGUs weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU.
Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU andthen to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.
2014 2013 m m Opening cost and net book value 479 480 Disposal note 13 1 Closing cost and net book value 479 479 The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows: 2014 2013 m m Consumer 337 337 TalkTalk Business 142 142 479 479 Impairment review The key assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment review are as follows: Long term growth rates Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD.
The rate applied in the current year was 1.7% 2013: 1.1%.
Discount rate The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk of the CGU.
The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.4% 2013: 8.1%.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs discount rate are benchmarked to externally available data.
The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the similarity of risk factors and geographical location.
Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate ofexpenditure.
Customer factors The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs, including acquisition costs and change in product mix.
The value assigned to each of these assumptions has been determined based on theextrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external information on expected trends of future market developments.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
b Other intangible assets Accounting policy Operating intangibles Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for internal use.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be measured reliably.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.
Acquisition intangibles Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six years on a straight line basis.
The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for contributory assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Impairment At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.
Determining whether the carrying amount of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Ifanindication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the valuein use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, touse to calculate present values.
Useful economic lives The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged totheincome statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Groupwill benefit from the assets.
Impairment of assets The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered animpairment loss at each reporting date.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the assets recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time valueofmoney and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced toits recoverable amount.

This includes additions of 15m 2013: 10m and an amortisation charge of 7m 2013: 5m in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group: TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of 76m 2013: 86m.
TRIO is amortised over a period of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component.
The weighted average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO is four years 2013: five years.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Acquisition intangibles Acquisition intangibles are removed from cost in the analysis in the year after they are fully amortised.
All acquisition intangibles relate to customer bases.
The customer bases relate primarily to the Tiscali UK internet access business, which was acquired in July 2009.
The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
At 31 March 2014, the Tiscali customer base is material to the Group with a net book value of 5m 2013: 23m and a remaining useful economic life of three months 2013: 15 months.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows: Short leasehold costs 10% or the lease term if less than ten years Network equipment and computer hardware 12.550% per annum Fixtures and fittings 2025% per annum Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based onthe useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, to calculate present values note 11.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date.

Non-current asset investments Accounting policy Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given plus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.
Investments are categorised as available for sale and are recorded at fair value.
Changes in fair value, together with any related taxation, aretaken directly to equity, and recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold or determined to be impaired.
Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2014 related to a 7.3% 2013: 8.4% interest in Shared Band Limited, a telecommunications technology provider.

Interest in joint venture Accounting policy Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the year.
In the Group balance sheet, the Groups interest in joint ventures are shown as a non-current asset, representing the Groups investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets orliabilities less provision for any impairment.
In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Groups interest in joint ventures includes, where applicable, any long term interests in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the joint venture.
An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the Groups interest in that joint venture.
Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Groups net investment are shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to the Group.
Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the Groups investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the Groups interest in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i. e. priority in liquidation.
The Group holds 14.3% of the ordinary share capital of YouView TV Limited, a joint venture with The British Broadcasting Corporation, ITVBroadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC, Channel Four Television Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.

The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period.
The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
Covenants included in this facility restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover and fixed charges interest and operating lease expenditure cover.
In addition to the RCF, the Group also has 30m of bilateral agreements which mature in March 2015.
The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments The book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments, excluding the Groups loans and other borrowings shown in note 18, are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 7 Trade and other receivables 260 226 Non-current assets Noncurrent investments and investment in joint venture 7 9 Current liabilities Bank overdrafts 7 Trade and other payables 456 428 Derivative financial instruments 3 196 189 Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Groups contractual commitments on future cash outflows.
Derivative financial instruments are included with other payables in note 17. a Financial instruments The Groups activities exposed it to a variety of financial risks including market risk such as currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group Treasury function used certain financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments primarily consisted of bank loans and interest rate swaps.
Other products, such ascurrency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding financial year.
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
The Group has cash flow hedges in place that swap the interest rate risk on the revolving credit facility RCF from floating to fixed.
These hedges have been fully effective from inception.
The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2, derived from other observable market data: this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date.
Fair value measurement at Level 2 gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted intervals for relevant currencies.
The Group has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2014 is nil 2013: 3m.
A gain of 3m 2013: loss of 2m has been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2014.
As the hedges were fully effective there has been no income statement impact.
b Embedded derivatives No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued c Foreign exchange risk The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar.
At 31 March 2014, the fair value of outstanding currency contracts was 7m 2013: 17m.
Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year end rates adjusted for funding to related parties and assuming all other variables remain constant.
There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK Sterling Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity.
The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows: UK Sterling Euro Other Total m m m m 2014 Borrowings before derivatives 497 497 Derivatives 7 10 3 490 10 3 497 UK Sterling Euro Other Total m m m m 2013 Borrowings before derivatives 400 400 Derivatives 17 19 2 383 19 2 400 During the year, the Group used derivatives for management of foreign currency cash balances held by overseas subsidiaries, which were inherited from CPW on demerger and foreign currency trading balances.
d Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover.
As detailed in section a, the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities.
This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year end positions prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued e Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it.
Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing facilities do not expire until March 2015 and November 2015: it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity Groupings.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows assuming year end interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have short or long term credit ratings appropriate to the Groups exposures.
Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from Consumer and TalkTalk Business fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables thatareconsidered to be irrecoverable.
