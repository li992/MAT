Repurchase agreements During the year, the Group established capability to undertake repurchase agreements in order to provide additional flexibility to raise short term cash from the financial markets.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into repurchase agreements which transferred the legal title of certain gilts, in return for cash, together with an agreement to repurchase the gilts at a later date and at a predetermined price.
The gilts were not derecognised from the Groups balance sheet as substantially all of the rewards, including interest income on the gilts, and risks, including credit and interest rate risks, are retained by the Group.
In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the gilts concerned, subject to delivering equivalent securities at the repurchase date.
The table below presents the carrying values of the transferred gilts and the associated repurchase agreement liabilities.
The associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets see note 2.

Fair value of financial liabilities The following table summarises the carrying values of financial liabilities presented on the Groups balance sheet.
The fair values presented in the table are at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement date.
2014 2013 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value Note million million million million Financial liabilities Customer deposits 1 24,624.9 24,679.7 23,100.4 23,142.1 Debt securities in issue 3 10.0 10.0 1.4 0.8 Subordinated liabilities 4 405.5 404.9 Derivative financial liabilities 28 116.7 116.7 85.6 85.6 The carrying amount of deposits from banks and items in course of transmission to banks is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As quoted market prices are not available for the Groups financial instruments, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.

Fair value of financial liabilities continued Valuation hierarchy of financial liabilities The table below analyses the fair values of financial liabilities of the Group which are carried at fair value or for which fair value isdisclosed above.
Total Total carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 fair value value At 31 December 2014 million million million million million Customer deposits 24,679.7 24,679.7 24,624.9 Debt securities in issue 10.0 10.0 10.0 Subordinated liabilities 404.9 404.9 405.5 Derivative financial liabilities 116.7 116.7 116.7 At 31 December 2013 Customer deposits 23,142.1 23,142.1 23,100.4 Debt securities in issue 0.8 0.8 1.4 Derivative financial liabilities 85.6 85.6 85.6 The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value for all other customer deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
The Groups subordinated liabilities and derivative financial liabilities, which comprise interest rate swaps, are valued using discounted cash flows where the most significant input is interest yield curves developed from publicly quoted rates and by reference to instruments with similar risk characteristics as the instruments held by the Group.
Liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
Derivative financial instruments are the only liabilities of the Group that are carried at fair value.
Level 1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Level 3 Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
