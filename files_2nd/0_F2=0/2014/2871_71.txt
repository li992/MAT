The Group have assessed whether they have control over DCC as required under IFRS 10.
The Groups ability to control the relevant activities of DCC is restricted by DCCs operating licence.
The power that the Group has over DCCs relevant activities by virtue of owning it is limited given the restrictions in the license.
That power is held by the board of DCC where the Group has minority representation in compliance with the licence.
