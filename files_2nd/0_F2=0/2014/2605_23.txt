NOTES 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been approved by the directors and prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRS IC.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as referred to in the Financial review on page 33 and under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: International Accounting Standard IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation: Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: and Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These have not had a material impact on the Groups overall results and financial position.
Some of the prior year numbers that were originally presented on a net basis in the Consolidated balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement and the relevant Notes have been re-presented on a gross basis to more accurately reflect the underlying transactions and to be consistent with the current year presentation.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion and deferred consideration, excluding payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired.
The excess of the consideration excluding payments contingent on future employment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Payments that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses of associates.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.
All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 81 NOTES CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Revenue The Group is engaged in the delivery of goods to customers.
Revenue from a sale is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the relevant goods, which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Returns provisions and early settlement discounts are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume discounts are based on agreements with customers.
Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
d Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the inventories sold or disposed of in the period, where the cost of inventories is net of supplier rebate income related to those inventories.
e Supplier rebates The Group has various rebate arrangements with a number of suppliers.
Some of these arrangements are based on the volume of products purchased and others are based on the volume of products sold.
Supplier rebate income is recognised in cost of goods sold concurrent with the sale of the inventories to which it relates and is calculated by reference to the expected consideration receivable from each rebate arrangement.
Supplier rebate income is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the amount due.
Supplier rebate income accrued but not yet received is included in other receivables.
f Share based payments The Group operates equity settled share based compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 and the Directors remuneration report.
The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model and is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
g Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land.
h Income tax Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items reflected in equity when it is recognised in equity.
Current tax reflects tax payable on taxable income for the year using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which any asset can be utilised.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
j Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
This is applied at the following annual rates: Buildings 2% or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years Plant and machinery 8%33% Fixtures, fittings and equipment 8%33% Freehold land Not depreciated The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
82 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED k Intangible assets i Goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous business combinations.
For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK GAAP.
For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination excluding payments contingent on future employment and other acquisition related costs in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value.
These principally relate to customer relationships and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
l Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
The recoverable amounts of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs to sell and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement.
m Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories comprises the purchase price, net of any related supplier volume rebates, plus import duties and other taxes, inbound freight and haulage costs and other related costs incurred to bring the product into its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale.
n Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts.
o Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
p Financial instruments Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement depending upon the classification of the instrument.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost unless they are in a fair value hedging relationship.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
i Fair value hedge Where a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement.
ii Cash flow hedge Where a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a hedge is used to hedge forecast transactions, any effective portion of the change in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
iii Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such differences are recognised in the income statement.
q Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, bank overdrafts and short term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 83 NOTES CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED r Net debt Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings and the fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
s Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the Groups obligations under the contract.
t Retirement benefit obligations i Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense to the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes Pension liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet and represent the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme liabilities.
Scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities.
Current service cost, past service cost credit and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is included within finance cost.
The net interest is calculated using the same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined benefit liability at the start of the period.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
u Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
At each reporting date the Group remeasures the value of the shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them in the own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date.
This is done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own shares reserve.
This movement has no effect on the actual numbers of shares held by the employee benefit trust.
v Dividends The interim dividend is recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
w Non-GAAP measures Further to the various performance measures defined under IFRS, the Group reports a number of additional performance measures that are designed to assist with the understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses.
These measures are not defined under IFRS and, as a result, do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice known as non-GAAP measures and may not be directly comparable with other companies non-GAAP measures.
They are not designed to be a substitute for any of the IFRS measures of performance.
The principal additional performance measures used within the consolidated financial statements include: adjusted operating profit: adjusted profit before income tax: adjusted profit for the year: adjusted earnings per share: and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
These measures exclude the charge for intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and, where relevant, the associated tax.
Intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and the associated tax are items which are not taken into account by management when assessing the results of the business as they do not relate to the underlying operating performance.
Accordingly, these items are removed in calculating the profitability measures by which management assess the performance of the Group.
Acquisition related costs comprise transaction costs and expenses, deferred consideration payments relating to the retention of former owners of businesses acquired and adjustments to previously estimated earn outs.
The Groups key performance indicators are set out and defined on pages 14 and 15.
A number of these are based on, or derived from, the non-GAAP measures noted above.
84 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated.
The directors review the judgements and estimates on an ongoing basis with revisions to accounting estimates recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The key sources of estimation at the balance sheet date that have risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are set out below.
The directors believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of the Groups performance and financial position.
Where appropriate and practicable, sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes.
a Retirement benefit obligations The cost of defined benefit pension schemes and the present value of the obligations relating thereto are determined using actuarial valuations appropriate for each country where defined benefit pension schemes are provided.
The actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, future pension increases and mortality rates.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
In determining the appropriate discount rates, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds with an AA rating in the relevant country.
Future salary increases and future pension increases are based on expected future inflation rates for each country.
Mortality rates are based on the relevant mortality tables for each country.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 20. b Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in Note 9. c Acquisitions Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method based on the fair value of the consideration paid.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the purchase price is allocated to assets and liabilities based on these fair values.
Determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including discount rates, asset lives and recoverability.
Assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and the value of freehold properties is typically determined by qualified valuers on an open market basis.
d Tax The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Management is required to make judgements and estimates in determining the provisions for income taxes recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that will be effective from 1 January 2015 and beyond.
Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Groups overall results and financial position.

The Group is managed through four business areas based on geographic regions which represent the reporting segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The revenue presented relates to external customers.
Sales between the business areas are not material.
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the foodservice, grocery, cleaning & hygiene, retail, safety and healthcare market sectors.
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to adjusted operating profit and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, the Companys chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors.
86 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 3 SEGMENT ANALYSIS CONTINUED Within each of the four business areas, there are a number of further segments based on geography and market sector.
These segments have been aggregated into the four business areas as shown above due to the similarity between them in terms of economic characteristics and also in respect of the nature of the products and services, types of customer and the methods used to distribute these products and services.
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue.
Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.

Accordingly, the figures for auditors remuneration shown above relate to PwC for 2014 and KPMG for 2013.
Non-audit services principally comprise tax services and further assurance services relating to pre-acquisition due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of acquisitions and disposals of businesses.
It is the Companys policy to assess the services required on a case by case basis to ensure that the most appropriate adviser is retained.
As a result it is sometimes appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Companys auditors.
However other firms are also used by the Company to provide non-audit services if such other firms are thought to be best placed to undertake the work involved.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the external auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors objectivity and independence are not compromised.
Further information is set out in the Audit Committees report on pages 48 to 51.

Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs and is tested annually for impairment.
A description of the Groups principal activities is set out in the Chief Executives review.
There is no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies.
The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical basis.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years being the maximum period over which detailed future cash flows for each CGU are prepared.
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate to derive a terminal value.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, including any significant changes to the customer base, achievability of future margins and the discount rate used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate which is consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates and managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
The growth rate has been calculated based principally on expected inflation rates of the relevant economies.
At 31 December 2014 North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
At 31 December 2014 the carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America was 245.2m 2013: 233.5m, France Hygiene was 76.5m 2013: 82.2m and UK Hospitality was 62.5m 2013: 62.5m.
At 31 December 2014 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality, was 538.1m 2013: 522.8m.
The remaining goodwill relates to CGUs which are not individually significant.
For North America, France Hygiene and UK Hospitality the weighted average long term growth rate used in 2014 was 2.5% 2013: 2.5%.
A discount rate of 9% 2013: 9% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with long term growth rates ranging from 2.5%7.2% and discount rates ranging from 9%18%.
92 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long term growth rates.
A key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent relates to revenue growth including the impact of changes to the underlying customer base.
This assumption is sensitive to customer attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management has concluded that it is reasonable to assume that there will be no material deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows and that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.

The Group monitors the return on average operating capital employed and the return on invested capital as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the return on average operating capital employed was 57.7% 2013: 56.9%, the return on invested capital was 17.6% 2013: 17.9%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2014 was 983.9m 2013: 939.9m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2014 was 105.6m 2013: 91.8m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are periodically reviewed by the executive directors and the Board.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and hypothetical derivatives.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants is monitored.
During 2014 all covenants have been complied with.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups banks and US private placement notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros.
Fixed interest US private placement notes of $252.0m and 35.0m were drawn down by the Group during 2014.
At 31 December 2014 the total US private placement notes outstanding were 793.2m 2013: 607.1m with maturities ranging from 2015 to 2026.
During the year the Group also refinanced or agreed new banking facilities totalling 358.1m.
The Groups committed bank facilities mature between 2016 and 2020.
At 31 December 2014 the available committed bank facilities totalled 917.0m 2013: 886.7m of which 136.5m 2013: 273.1m was drawn down.
94 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The undrawn committed bank facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2014 2013 m m Expiring within one year 40.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 90.0 245.8 Expiring after two years 690.5 327.8 780.5 613.6 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
At 31 December 2014 loans totalling 0.8m were secured by fixed charges on property 2013: 0.8m.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out in the tables below.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative assets and liabilities have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.

Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of both financial assets and liabilities are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using observable inputs and translating at the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates.
The Group has taken into account its own credit risk in the valuation of financial assets and its counterparties credit risk in the valuation of financial liabilities carried at fair value.
Fair value gains and losses on interest rate caps impact the income statement immediately while all other financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value are in hedging relationships.
96 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to counterparty offsetting or master netting agreements.
The master netting agreements regulate settlement amounts in the event either party defaults on their obligations.

In addition, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage the interest rate risk profile.
At 31 December 2014 fixed rate debt of 635.7m 2013: 607.1m related to fixed rate US private placement notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros was stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2015 to 2024.
At 31 December 2014, floating rate debt was comprised of 136.5m floating rate bank loans 2013: 273.1m and 173.6m of fixed rate US private placement notes with maturities in 2025 and 2026 which have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps 2013: nil.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps reprice every three months.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 45.5m were capped at 31 December 2014 2013: 60.0m.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps since the majority of their value is related to time value.
The strike rates of these options are based on LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2014 1.4 1.4 2013 0.6 0.1 0.6 0.1 Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups sales are made and income is earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 US dollar 1.65 1.56 1.56 1.66 Euro 1.24 1.18 1.29 1.20 For the year ended 31 December 2014, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange rates would have changed profit before income tax by 0.9m and 0.4m respectively 2013: 1.0m and 0.3m and adjusted profit before income tax by 1.0m and 0.6m respectively 2013: 1.1m and 0.6m.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 97 NOTES CONTINUED 13 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited.
Where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
However, the economic impact of foreign exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged.
As a result, sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases.
For the year ended 31 December 2014 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a gain of 3.0m recognised in equity 2013: loss of 0.7m which will affect the income statement during 2015.
The majority of the Groups borrowings are effectively denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros, aligning them to the respective functional currencies of the component parts of the Groups EBITDA.
This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts, long term cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt.
This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Cross currency interest rate swaps in a cash flow hedge relationship were effective during the year with no gain or loss 2013: loss of 0.4m being recognised in equity which will affect the income statement in 2015.
The currency profile of the Groups net debt at 31 December is set out in the table below: 2014 2013 m m US dollar 398.6 388.2 Sterling 261.7 292.7 Euro 133.9 149.9 Other 83.2 18.7 877.4 849.5 If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below.
The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.

The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash and deposits Note 23, derivative financial instruments see page 95 and trade and other receivables Note 11 is their carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and investment grade rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.

The Group has provisions for expected legal, environmental and other claims based on managements best estimate at the balance sheet date of the probable loss likely to be incurred.
It expects that these amounts, which are based on detailed plans or other known factors and take account of past experience for similar items, will be settled within the next one to five years.
The Group is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations.
While any litigation has an element of uncertainty, management does not expect that the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.

The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the remittance of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
In general, the Company has determined either that such earnings will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise.
A deferred tax liability of 3.0m 2013: 3.0m has been recognised in exceptional cases where distribution of earnings is both planned and expected to result in a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 8.6m 2013: 9.0m.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 96.2m 2013: 96.1m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.

Further details of the share plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors remuneration report.
Sharesave Scheme 2011 The Sharesave Scheme 2011, approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, is an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax advantaged scheme in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme 2011 options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
The Sharesave Scheme 2011 replaced the Sharesave Scheme 2001 which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Sharesave Scheme 2001 operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
Although there are a number of options outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme 2001, no further options have been granted under this Scheme since it expired in May 2011. International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
The plan operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately 250 per month or the equivalent in other currencies over a period of three years.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of the euro equivalent of approximately 250 per month over a period of three years.
100 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 16 SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2004 LTIP The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and expired in May 2014.
No further share options or performance share awards have been granted under the 2004 LTIP since that date.
The 2004 LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted up to April 2014 have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation over three financial years by a specified margin.
Part B of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation over three years by a specified margin.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 2014 LTIP The 2014 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and replaced the 2004 LTIP.
The 2014 LTIP is also divided into two parts.
Part A of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options.
The performance condition for the share options granted to date is based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years meeting certain specified targets.
Part B of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
The extent to which performance share awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years meeting certain specified targets.
Investment in own shares The Company holds a number of its ordinary shares in an employee benefit trust.
The principal purpose of this trust is to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to certain senior employees and executive directors relating to options granted and awards made in respect of market purchase shares under the LTIP and the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme DASBS.
Details of such plans are set out above and in the Directors remuneration report.
The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in the consolidated financial statements.
Finance costs and administration charges are included in the income statement on an accruals basis.
At 31 December 2014 the trust held 6,527,329 2013: 6,895,539 shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 2.1m 2013: 2.2m and market value of 115.1m 2013: 100.0m.
IFRS 2 disclosures Options granted during the year have been valued using a stochastic model.

20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the UK, the US and other countries including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were last carried out on the UK defined benefit schemes in April 2012 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit schemes has been updated to 31 December 2014 by the Groups actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
Characteristics Europe The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in Europe including the UK, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
The Groups principal defined benefit scheme in Europe is the UK scheme.
The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003.
The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee.
Although the Company bears the financial cost of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment strategy decisions.
A fide-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.
The last triennial review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2012 and showed that there was a deficit on the agreed funding basis.
To address the deficit, the Company has agreed to contribute an additional 5.5m per year from April 2013 to March 2019.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 103 NOTES CONTINUED 20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED US The US defined benefit scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an independent custodian.
The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue reporting requirements.
The scheme pays annual premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.
The Company has established a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee.
The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries and as such are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets.
The Committee performs the oversight function and delegates the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff.
A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the investment of scheme assets.
In 2014, a lump sum payment option was offered to deferred vested and retired participants in the scheme in satisfaction of their future entitlements under the scheme.
The total payment made to the eligible participants that elected to take the lump sum payment option was 25.3m as a result of which, the scheme assets and liabilities have reduced by the same amount.
The last annual review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2014 and showed that there was a required annual contribution of 2.4m.
The Group plans to contribute 4.8m for the 2014 plan year to cover prudently this required contribution and anticipate future funding needs.
In the 2013 plan year, the Group paid a contribution of 4.8m.
Risks The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the defined benefit schemes are described below: Inflation risk the majority of the UK schemes liabilities increase in line with inflation and, as a result, if inflation is greater than expected the liabilities will increase.
The impact of high inflation is capped each year for the UK schemes benefits.
The US schemes liabilities are not directly tied to inflationary increases.
Interest rate risk a fall in bond yields will increase the value of the schemes liabilities.
A proportion of both the UK and US schemes assets are invested in liability matching assets to mitigate bond yield and inflation risk.
Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the schemes and consequently increases in the schemes liabilities.
The mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.
Investment risk the schemes invest in a diversified range of asset classes to mitigate the risk of falls in any one area of the investments.
In the UK, the trustee implements partial currency hedging on the overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
The risks above could lead to a material deficit in the schemes.
Given the long term time horizon of the schemes cash flows, the assumptions used are uncertain and can be volatile from year to year.
The Company and the trustees seek to mitigate actively the risks associated with the schemes.
A higher retirement benefit obligation could lead to additional funding requirements in future years.
Any deficit measured on a funding valuation basis, which may differ from the actuarial valuation under IAS 19, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are appropriate to the Group and in line with the relevant regulations.

The acquisition was completed on 2 January 2015.
Acquisitions involving the purchase of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, the relevant assets of the businesses acquired, have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At 31 December 2014 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2014 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
108 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 24 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly, adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired.
IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment, including payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, are charged to the income statement.
All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
