Strategy Additional Overview review Performance Governance Financials information 87 Contents The Consolidated financial statements on pages 96 to 170 are presented on a statutory basis which, under IFRS accounting principles, includes the financial results of the Groups joint ventures using the equity accounting basis.
As detailed in Financial highlights on page 3, this differs from the management basis used in the discussion of our results in the strategic report, which includes the results of the Groups joint ventures on a proportionate basis, which is how the business is managed and operated and performance reported to management.

Subsequent events Reporting our financial performance We continue to review the format of our consolidated financial statements with the aim of making them clear and easier to follow.
This year, in addition to continuing with the integrated financial review which combines commentary on certain items within the primary financial statements, we have changed the order and grouping of the notes to the financial statements to help with the flow of information and focus on areas that we feel are key to understanding our business.
We have also placed accounting policies within the notes to the accounts to which they best relate.
We hope this format makes it easier for you to navigate to the information that is important to you.
