Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows cash outflows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $14,615 million at 31 December 2014 2013 $12,222 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.
Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 27.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the application of hedge accounting and the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.
These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments continued Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.
The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 27.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.
The sale agreement contained an embedded derivative the whole agreement has, consequently, been designated at fair value through profit or loss and shown within other derivatives held for trading, and falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuation depends on refinery throughput and future margins.

The most significant gross assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are US natural gas contracts.
At 31 December 2014, the gross US natural gas price instruments dependent on inputs at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy were an asset of $586 million and liability of $526 million net fair value of $60 million, with $126 million, net, valued using level 2 inputs.
US natural gas price derivatives are valued using observable market data for maturities up to 60 months in basis locations that trade at a premium or discount to the NYMEX Henry Hub price, and using internally developed price curves based on economic forecasts for periods beyond that time.
The significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the year ended 31 December 2014 are presented below.
Range Weighted average Unobservable inputs $ mmBtu $ mmBtu Natural gas price contracts Long-dated market price 3.44-6.39 4.64 If the natural gas prices after 2019 were 10% higher lower, this would result in a decrease increase in derivative assets of $85 million, and decrease increase in derivative liabilities of $64 million, and a net decrease increase in profit before tax of $21 million.
Derivative gains and losses Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included within sales and other operating revenues and within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, and relate to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a net gain of $6,154 million 2013 $587 million net gain and 2012 $411 million net loss.
This number does not include gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases or the change in value of transportation and storage contracts which are not recognized under IFRS, but does include the associated financially settled contracts.
The net amount for actual gains and losses relating to derivative contracts and all related items therefore differs significantly from the amount disclosed above.
Embedded derivatives The group is a party to certain natural gas contracts containing embedded derivatives.
Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products, power and inflation.
After the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognizedon the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
Key information on the natural gas contracts is given below.
At 31 December 2014 2013 Remaining contract terms 5 months to 3 years and 9 months 1 year and 5 months to 4 years and 9 months Contractual notional amount 70 million therms 153 million therms 150 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 Financial statements 28.
Derivative financial instruments continued The commodity price embedded derivatives relate to natural gas contracts and are categorized in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The contracts in level 2 are valued using inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data.
Where necessary, the price curves are extrapolated to the expiry of the contracts the last of which is in 2018 using all available external pricing information: additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historical and long-term pricing relationships.
These valuations are categorized in level 3.
Transfers from level 3 to level 2 occur when the valuation no longer depends significantly on extrapolatedor interpolated data.
Valuations use observable market data for maturities up to 36 months, and internally developed price curves based on economic forecasts for periods beyond that time.
The fair value gain on commodity price embedded derivatives was $430 million 2013 gain of $459 million, 2012 gain of $347 million.
The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of embedded derivatives, within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2014, the group held currency forwards and futures contracts and cylinders that were being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions.
Note 27 outlines the groups approach to foreign currency exchange risk management.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
The amounts remaining in equity at 31 December 2014 in relation to these cash flow hedges consist of deferred losses of $160 million maturing in 2015, deferred losses of $10 million maturing in 2016 and deferred gains of $3 million maturing in 2017 and beyond.
At 31 December 2012, BP had entered into three agreements to sell its 50% interest in TNK-BP and acquire 18.5% of Rosneft.
During the period from signing until completion on 21 March 2013, these agreements represented derivative financial instruments that were required to be measured at fair value.
BP designated two of the agreements, for the acquisition of a 5.66% shareholding in Rosneft from Rosneftegaz, and for the acquisition of a 9.80% shareholding from Rosneft, as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge, and so changes in the fair values of these agreements were recognized in other comprehensive income.
The third agreement, under which BP sold its 50% interest in TNK-BP in exchange for cash and a 3.04% shareholding in Rosneft, was also a derivative financial instrument, but its fair value could not be reliably measured.
An asset of $1,410 million related to these agreements was recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2012, of which $1,339 million related to the fair value of the cash flow hedge derivatives.
The derivatives measured at fair value at 31 December 2012 were categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy using inputs that included the quoted Rosneft share price.
During 2013, a charge of $2,061 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to these agreements and $4 million was recognized in the income statement.
The resulting cumulative charge of $651 million recognized in other comprehensive income would only be recognized in the income statement if the investment in Rosneft were either sold or impaired.
The cash flow hedge derivatives were valued using the quoted Rosneft share price at the time the deal completed, of $7.60 per share.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2014, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The loss on the hedging derivative instruments recognized in the income statement in 2014 was $14 million 2013 $1,240 million loss and 2012 $536 million gain offset by a gain on the fair value of the finance debt of $8 million 2013 $1,228 million gain and 2012 $537 million loss.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to twelve years, and have the same maturity terms as the debt that they are hedging.
They are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Norwegian Krone and Hong Kong dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt.
Note 27 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management.
