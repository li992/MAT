Shareholding Guidelines Audited It is the Boards policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Companys senior management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company.
Each Executive Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary.
If the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the Companys shares until the holding requirement is achieved.
