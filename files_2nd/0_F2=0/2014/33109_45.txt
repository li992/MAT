Tax continued 12 ii Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax charge is lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
The differences are: 2014 2013 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 654.4 212.1 Add back valuation surplus in respect of UK properties not taxable 112.1 467.5 186.9 100.0 Multiplied by standard rate of UK corporation tax of 21.5 per cent 2013: 23.25 per cent 40.2 23.2 EFFECTS OF: Exempt SIIC & REIT gains 32.1 18.4 Permanent differences 1.1 0.1 Joint venture tax adjustment 9.2 5.2 Higher tax rates on international earnings 1.3 1.4 US tax refund 33.6 Adjustments in respect of earlier years and assets not recognised 4.6 6.9 TOTAL TAX CREDIT CHARGE ON PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES 27.6 2.9 The joint venture tax adjustment is required because the profit on ordinary activities before tax includes share of profit from joint ventures after tax, whereas the total tax balance excludes joint ventures.

Further unrecognised tax losses of 742.1 million also exist at 31 December 2014 2013: 586.9 million of which 32.4 million 2013: 29.8 million expires in 15 years.
12 iv Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, nonet UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 20 per cent by April 2015.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups taxcharge.
