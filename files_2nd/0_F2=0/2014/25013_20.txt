ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 103 Basis of preparation Preparation of financial statements The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the separate financial statements of ICAP plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as endorsed by the EU and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued by the IASB and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and its predecessor body.
In publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, ICAP plc has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement, individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and presented in millions.
ICAP plc is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company are included within the notes to which they relate and are shaded in blue.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to apply judgements and the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions.
Management considers impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation note 14 to be the area where increased judgement is required.
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty, are set out in the relevant notes in the financial statements.
Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts which differ from those estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
During the year, the Group has early adopted amendments to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and amendments to IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and made the necessary disclosures in note 17 Trade and other receivables.
The Group also adopted other new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards that did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
They include IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement, amendments to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements and amendments to IAS19 Employee Benefits.
Presentation of the income statement The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
The columnar format enables the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting its trading profit.
This is the profit measure used to calculate trading EPS note 4 and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups trading earnings.
Trading profit is reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The column acquisition and disposal costs includes: any gains, losses or other associated costs on the full or partial disposal of investments, associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries and costs associated with a combination that do not constitute fees relating to the arrangement of financing: amortisation or impairment of intangible assets arising on consolidation: any re-measurement after initial recognition of deferred contingent consideration which has been classified as a liability: any gains or losses on the revaluation of previous interests.
The column may also include items such as gains or losses on the settlement of pre-existing relationships with acquired businesses and the remeasurement of liabilities that are above the value of indemnification.
Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, are disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a longterm basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the costs of the acquisition are less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
104 ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Basis of preparation continued Basis of consolidation continued Subsidiaries continued Fees associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred.
When the Group increases its investment in an entity resulting in an associate becoming a subsidiary, the intangibles related to the acquisition are valued and the element of those not previously recognised as a share of net assets are recorded as revaluation gains realised in the year in other comprehensive income.
A change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration received recognised directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group derecognises the non-controlling interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling interest on exercise of those options.
The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid payable and the non-controlling interests share of net assets, is recognised in equity.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised within the consolidated income statement.
Where the Group has a call option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until it is certain that the option will be called.
At that point the accounting treatment is the same as for a put option.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of companies disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
On consolidation, the accounting policies of Group companies the Company and its subsidiaries are consistent with those applied by the Group.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line-by-line basis.
Associates The Group classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, but not control, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, as associates.
Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method.
Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets.
Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the prior month closing exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency.
At each end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where these form part of the net investment of an overseas business or are designated as hedges of a net investment or cash flow and, therefore, the changes in value resulting from exchanges, differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, the results of businesses with non-pound sterling functional currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the year where these approximate to the rate at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised within other comprehensive income.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the consolidated income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a non-pound sterling entity are treated as assets and liabilities of that entity and translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the period closing rate.
Where applicable, the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
Governance and Strategic report Financial statements Other information directors report ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 105 Future accounting developments At 31 March 2014, a number of standards and amendments to standards had been issued by the IASB which are not effective for these consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the standards and amendments to standards described below, the IASB is also continuing to work on projects on insurance, revenue recognition and lease accounting, which together with the following could represent significant changes to accounting requirements in the future.
IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements requires a parent to present consolidated financial statements as those of a single economic entity, replacing the requirements previously contained in IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
The standard has been endorsed by the EU for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS31 Interests in Joint Ventures and requires a party to a joint arrangement to determine the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved by assessing its rights and obligations and then account for those rights and obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement.
IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities requires the extensive disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
IAS27 2011 Separate Financial Statements carries forward the existing accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS27 2008 for separate financial statements, with some minor clarifications.
The requirements of IAS28 2008 and IAS31 for separate financial statements have been incorporated into IAS27 2011.
The revised standard has been endorsed by the EU for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IAS28 2011 Associates and Joint Ventures includes the requirements for joint ventures and associates to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS11 Joint Arrangements.
The impact on the Group financial statements of adopting IFRS11 and IAS28 2011 is disclosed in note 20 to the financial statements.
Adoption of the other standards will have an immaterial impact on the Group financial statements.
In November 2013, the IASB announced the completion of phase III hedge accounting of the IFRS9: Financial Instruments project.
In an announcement made on 19 November 2013 the IASB postponed the previously targeted mandatory effective date of 1 January 2015, citing that the impairment phase oject had not yet been completed.
The IASB also noted that a new date will be decided on when the entire IFRS9 project is closer to phase II of the pr completion.
The impact on the Group financial statements of adopting phase I classification and measurement and phase III hedge accounting is currently under review, but the Group will only adopt IFRS9 as a complete standard.
