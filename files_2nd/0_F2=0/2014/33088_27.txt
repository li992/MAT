GENERAL INFORMATION Big Yellow Group PLC is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 2 The Deans, Bridge Road, Bagshot, Surrey, GU19 5AT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Strategic Report on pages 14 to 32.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Adoption of new and revised standards The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 2011 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Transition Guidance Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets With the exception of IFRS 13, their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
Under IFRS 13 the Groups derivative financial instruments are now subject to a credit value adjustment CVA.
The CVA takes into account the credit worthiness of the respective counterparties.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle definition of 'vesting condition' IFRS 3 Business Combinations Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle accounting for contingent consideration IFRS 3 Business Combinations Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle scope exception for joint ventures IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Deferral of mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 and amendments to transition disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle aggregation of segments, reconciliation of segment assets IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Deferral of mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 and amendments to transition disclosures IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle scope of the portfolio exception in paragraph 52 IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation on revaluation IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amended to clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle management entities IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendments relating to the offsetting of assets and liabilities IAS 36 Impairment of Assets Amendments arising from Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets IAS 38 Intangible Assets Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation on revaluation IAS 40 Investment Property Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle interrelationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40 We do not expect there to be a material impact from the adoption of these standards.
87 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2014 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year, are set out below: Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on in the Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes to the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Strategic Report and in the notes to the financial statements.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities, forecast valuation movements and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2015 and projections contained in the longer term business plan which covers the period to March 2019.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment and the other principal risks to the Groups performance, and are satisfied with the Groups positioning.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to direct the relevant activities of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Any costs directly attributable to the business combination are recognised in the income statement.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
The goodwill in the balance sheet has an indefinite useful economic life.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage room is occupied by the customer on a straight-line basis.
The Group recognises non-storage income on a straight-line basis over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which the services are provided.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after gains and losses on surplus land, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2014 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant, equipment and owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and investment properties, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criteria used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment property held as a leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the statement of comprehensive income of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 21.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Investment property under construction Investment property under construction is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property under construction are included in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Surplus land Surplus land, which can include assets held for development and future sale, is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any gains and losses on surplus land are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories, representing the cost of packing materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the other gains and losses line item in the income statement.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
B Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
F Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged as an expense to the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model and excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recovered in profit and loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
91 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2014 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Estimate of fair value of Investment Properties and Investment Property Under Construction The Groups self storage centres and stores under development are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying the estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Capital Goods Scheme receivable The Group has a receivable in respect of amounts due back from HMRC under the Capital Goods Scheme following the imposition of VAT on self storage from 1 October 2012.
The amount recognised has been calculated in accordance with the relevant legislation, but is subject to confirmation by HMRC.
The amount is payable over up to ten years and has been discounted at the Groups average cost of debt.
REVENUE Analysis of the Groups operating revenue can be found below and in the Portfolio Summary on page 20.
2014 2013 000 000 Open stores Self storage income 59,994 58,112 Other storage related income 10,475 9,996 Ancillary store rental income 237 226 70,706 68,334 Other revenue Non-storage income 420 298 Fees earned from Big Yellow Limited Partnership 640 639 Other management fees earned 430 400 Revenue per statement of comprehensive income 72,196 69,671 Interest receivable on bank deposits see note 7 20 33 Total revenue per IAS 18 72,216 69,704 Non-storage income derives principally from rental income earned from tenants of properties awaiting development.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there is one segment, which is the provision of self storage and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage and related services which fall within the Group's ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year and prior year.

TAXATION The Group converted to a REIT in January 2007.
As a result the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from its qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group are subject to corporation tax as normal.
The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions.
There have been no breaches of the conditions to date.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS continued The Partnership has a 60 million bank facility with RBS and HSBC expiring in September 2016.
2 million of this facility has been voluntarily repaid and cancelled during the year, leaving drawn debt at 58 million at 31 March 2014.
The loan amortises to 51.1 million by September 2016, with amortisation starting in June 2014.
The average cost of debt of the facility in the year was 5.1%.
Interest rate derivatives are in place covering 50% of the drawn debt at a pre-margin cost of 1.05%.
There is a margin ratchet based on the Partnerships income cover which ranges between 250 bps and 400 bps.
The Partnership loan has a loan to value covenant which requires the gross loan to the value of the Partnerships investment property assets to be no more than 55%.
The loan is non-recourse to the Group.
The Group has an option to acquire the property assets within the Partnership exercisable at 31 March 2014 subject to an IRR hurdle being achieved and at 31 March 2015 with no IRR hurdle.
The option has been deferred at 31 March 2014, and has been assessed to have nil value at 31 March 2014.
The Directors have considered the rights the option bestows on the Group and have concluded that as at 31 March 2014, the option does not allow the Group to direct the relevant activities of the Partnership and accordingly continues to account for its investment in the Partnership on an equity accounting basis.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued The Group has classified the fair value investment property and the investment property under construction within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
There has been no transfer to or from Level 3 in the year.
"The freehold and leasehold investment properties have been valued at 31 March 2014 by external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP ""C&W""."
"The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ""the Red Book""."
The valuation of each of the investment properties and the investment properties under construction has been prepared on the basis of either Fair Value or Fair Value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential, as appropriate.
The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book.
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W have confirmed that: The members of the RICS who have been the signatories to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation have done so since September 2004: C&W have been carrying out this bi-annual valuation for the same purposes as this valuation on behalf of the Group since September 2004: C&W do not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group: In relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of the total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less than 5%: and The fee payable to C&W is a fixed amount per store, and is not contingent on the appraised value.
Market uncertainty C&Ws valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from low liquidity in the market for self storage property.
C&W note that, although there were a number of self storage transactions in 2007, the only significant transactions since 2007 are: 1.
The sale of a 51% share in Shurgard Europe which was announced in January 2008 and completed on 31 March 2008: 2.
The sale of the former Keepsafe portfolio by Macquarie to Alligator Self Storage which was completed in January 2010: 3.
The purchase by Shurgard Europe of the 80% interests held by its joint venture partner Arcapita in its two European joint venture vehicles, First Shurgard and Second Shurgard.
The price paid was 172 million Euros and the transaction was announced in March 2011.
The two joint ventures owned 72 self storage properties: and 4.
The purchase of Selstor, Sweden, by Pelican Self Storage M3 Capital in the fourth quarter of 2012.
There have been ten single store market transactions in the UK since 2010.
C&W state that due to the lack of comparable market information in the self storage sector, there is greater uncertainty attached to their opinion of value than would be anticipated during more active market conditions.
Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold and long leasehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Assumptions A Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% of the estimated annual revenue subject to a cap and a collar.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
B The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming either straight-line absorption from day one actual occupancy or variable absorption over years one to four of the cash flow period to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 54 trading stores both freeholds and leaseholds open at 31 March 2014 averages 81.1% 31 March 2013: 81.5%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
The average time assumed for the 32 established stores to trade at their maturity levels is 29 months 31 March 2013: 32 months : for the 22 lease-up stores, the period to maturity is 36 months 31 March 2013: 43 months.
C The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, yields for other trading property types such as student housing and hotels, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
The valuation included in the accounts assumes rental growth in future periods.
If an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre-administration expenses for the 32 established stores is 7.0% 31 March 2013: 6.8% rising to a stabilised net yield pre-administration expenses of 7.8% 31 March 2013: 8.1%.
Also on a no growth and pre-administration expenses basis the 22 lease-up stores have a net initial yield of 5.5% 31 March 2013: 4.9% rising to 7.8% 31 March 2013: 8.4% on stabilisation.
D The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 11.0% 31 March 2013: 11.2%.
E Purchasers costs of 5.8% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.8% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Short leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leasehold properties is 16.8 years 31 March 2013: 15.7 years.
Investment properties under construction C&W have valued the stores in development adopting the same methodology as set out above but on the basis of the cash flow projection expected for the store at opening and after allowing for the outstanding costs to take each scheme from its current state to completion and full fit-out.
C&W have allowed for holding costs and construction contingency, as appropriate.
One scheme does not yet have planning consent and C&W have reflected the planning risk in their valuation.
Immature stores: value uncertainty C&W have assessed the value of each property individually.
However, two of the stores in the portfolio are relatively immature and have low initial cash flow.
C&W have endeavoured to reflect the nature of the cash flow profile for these properties in their valuation, and the higher associated risks relating to the as yet unproven future cash flow, by adjustment to the capitalisation rates and discount rates adopted.
However, immature low cash flow stores of this nature are rarely, if ever, traded individually in the market, unless as part of a distressed sale or similar situation.
Although, there is more evidence of immature low cash flow stores being traded as part of a group or portfolio transaction.
Please note C&Ws comments in relation to market uncertainty in the self storage sector due to the lack of comparable market transactions and information.
The degree of uncertainty relating to the two immature stores is greater than in relation to the balance of the properties due to there being even less market evidence that might be available for more mature properties and portfolios.
C&W state that in practice, if an actual sale of the properties were to be contemplated then any immature low cash flow stores would normally be presented to the market for sale lotted or grouped with other more mature assets owned by the same entity, in order to alleviate the issue of negative or low short term cash flow.
This approach would enhance the marketability of the group of assets and assist in achieving the best price available in the market by diluting the cash flow risk.
C&W have not adjusted their opinion of fair value to reflect such a grouping of the immature assets with other properties in the portfolio and all stores have been valued individually.
However, they highlight the matter to alert the Group to the manner in which the properties might be grouped or lotted in order maximise their attractiveness to the market place.
C&W consider this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an assumption that assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material difference in value.
C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the entity would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly either higher or lower from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting the lotting assumption described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.8% of gross value, being the maximum amount for notional purchasers costs as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
The Group therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2014 of 834.2 million 35.5 million higher than the value recorded in the financial statements.
The valuations in Big Yellow Limited Partnership are 4.8 million higher than the value recorded in the financial statements, of which the Groups share is 1.6 million.
The sum of these is 37.1 million and translates to 26.0 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The Financial Review contains commentary on the Capital Goods Scheme receivable.
Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers, requiring them to pay in advance of their storage period and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that these customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between one week to four weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 285,000 2013: 384,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables is 37 days past due 2013: 34 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2014 2013 000 000 1 30 days 136 299 30 60 days 52 37 60 days 97 48 Total 285 384 The aged debtors relate principally to tenants at sites awaiting development, rather than storage customers.
The majority of these amounts have been collected since the year end.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2014 2013 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 45 24 Amounts provided in year 73 116 Amounts written off as uncollectible 76 95 Balance at the end of the year 42 45 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 31 March 31 March 2014 2013 000 000 Current Trade payables 10,758 8,454 Other payables 5,647 5,445 Accruals and deferred income 10,330 10,500 Amounts owed to associate 2 2 VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 81 20 26,818 24,421 Non-current VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 12 The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit terms.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups VAT payable under the Capital Goods Scheme as follows: 2014 2013 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 000 000 000 000 VAT payable under the Capital Goods Scheme 81 81 32 31 The fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at interest rates prevailing at the year end.
103 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2014 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups debt facilities require 60% of total drawn debt to be fixed.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
With the exception of derivative instruments which are classified as a financial liability at fair value through the profit and loss FVTPL, financial liabilities are categorised under amortised cost.
All financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Debt 229,368 238,306 Cash and cash equivalents 3,301 7,850 Net debt 226,067 230,456 Balance sheet equity 594,064 552,628 Net debt to equity ratio 38.1% 41.7% Debt is defined as long term and short term borrowings, as detailed in note 19, excluding finance leases and debt issue costs.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on 40 self storage assets and sites, and through a 15 year loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited secured on a portfolio of 15 self storage assets.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
At 31 March 2014 the Group had one interest rate derivative in place: 70 million fixed at 2.80% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2016.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is one month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the statement of comprehensive income.
The gain in the statement of comprehensive income for the year on the fair value of interest rate derivatives was 2,681,000 2013: loss of 223,000.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2014 was a liability of 2,813,000 2013: liability of 5,494,000.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2014, it is estimated that an increase of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 315,000 2013: reduced adjusted profit before tax by 350,000 and a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 315,000 2013: increased adjusted profit before tax by 350,000.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the year, following the repayment of floating rate debt from cash resources.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 42,000 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
H. Financial maturity analysis In respect of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table provides a maturity analysis for individual elements.

Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and short term deposits and those of other financial assets equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables at amortised cost are set out in note 16.
The amounts are presented net of provisions for doubtful receivables, and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Trade and other payables, including bank borrowings, are carried at amortised cost.
Finance lease liabilities are included at the fair value of their minimum lease payments.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
The fair value of the Groups outstanding interest rate derivative, as detailed in note 18C, has been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7.
There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1 or Level 3.
Maturity analysis of financial liabilities The contractual maturities based on market conditions and expected yield curves prevailing at the year end date are as follows: Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2014 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 115,534 28,355 143,889 From two to five years 306 155,696 6,308 162,310 From one to two years 1,062 12,279 1,646 14,987 Due after more than one year 1,368 283,509 36,309 321,186 Due within one year 26,818 1,558 12,279 1,646 42,301 Total 26,818 2,926 295,788 37,955 363,487 Trade and other Interest rate Borrowings Finance payables swaps and interest leases Total 2013 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 122,377 23,489 145,866 From two to five years 2,216 168,561 5,965 176,742 From one to two years 12 1,649 12,472 1,989 16,122 Due after more than one year 12 3,865 303,410 31,443 338,730 Due within one year 24,421 1,641 12,472 1,989 40,523 Total 24,433 5,506 315,882 33,432 379,253 K.

The Group has 22,000,000 in undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2014, which expire between two and three years 2013: 15,000,000 expiring between three and four years.
In April 2012, the Group completed a 100 million 15 year fixed rate loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited.
The loan is secured over a portfolio of 15 freehold self storage centres which were valued at 242.1 million at 29 February 2012 for the purposes of the drawdown.
The annual fixed interest rate on the loan is 4.90%.
The loan amortises to 60 million over the course of the 15 years, consistent with the Group's medium term debt reduction strategy.
The debt service is payable monthly based on fixed annual amounts.
The loan outstanding on the fifth anniversary will be 89.8 million: 76.7 million outstanding on the tenth anniversary, with 60 million remaining at expiry in April 2027.
The Group has a 155 million 4 year bank facility with Lloyds, HSBC and Santander, expiring in September 2016.
120 million of the facility is term loan with the balance of 35 million revolving.
The facilities attract a ratcheted margin over LIBOR based on interest cover.
The Group is currently paying a blended 2.4% margin, the lowest margin on the ratchet, which is effective for asset income cover of greater than 3 times.
The Group was comfortably in compliance with its banking covenants at 31 March 2014, as illustrated in the table below.
Covenant At 31 March Covenant level 2014 Consolidated EBITDA Minimum 1.5x 3.96x Consolidated net tangible assets less goodwill Minimum 250m 592.6 m Bank loan income cover Minimum 1.75x 5.29x Aviva loan interest service cover ratio Minimum 1.5x 2.64x Aviva loan debt service cover ratio Minimum 1.2x 1.88x The bank and Aviva loan income cover ratios are calculated by dividing the net operating income earned from the respective charged asset pools by the interest charged on each loan over a rolling 12 month period.
The Aviva debt service covenant additionally includes the capital repayment with the interest.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has four equity share-based payment arrangements, namely approved and unapproved share option schemes, an LTIP scheme, an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE and a Long Term Bonus Performance Plan.
The Group recognised a total expense in the year related to equitysettled share-based payment transactions of 1,437,000 2013: 1,376,000.
Equity-settled share option plans The Group granted options to employees under Approved and Unapproved HMRC Share option schemes between November 1999 and November 2003.
The Groups schemes provided for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three to ten years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Since 2004 the Group has operated an Employee Share Save Scheme SAYE which allows any employee who has more than six months service to purchase shares at a 20% discount to the average quoted market price of the Group shares at the date of grant.
The associated savings contracts are three years at which point the employee can exercise their option to purchase the shares or take the amount saved, including interest, in cash.
The scheme is administered by Yorkshire Building Society.
On an annual basis since 2004 the Group awarded nil-paid options to senior management under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The awards are conditional on the achievement of challenging performance targets as described on page 60 of the Remuneration Report.
The awards granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 vested in full.
The awards granted in 2007 and 2009 lapsed, and the awards granted in 2008 and 2010 partially vested.
