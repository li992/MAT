Principal subsidiaries Our subsidiaries are located around the world and each contributes to the profits, assets and cash flow of the Group.
We have a large number of subsidiaries and so, for practical reasons, only the principal subsidiaries at 31 March 2014 are detailed below.
Accounting policies A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Companys returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholders share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
