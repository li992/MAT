Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant amounts of goodwill: 2014 2013 m m Construction services excluding the Middle East segment UK construction 233.0 233.0 Canada construction 9.8 10.1 242.8 243.1 Support services segment UK services 1,191.2 1,191.2 Canada services 85.1 15.4 1,276.3 1,206.6 Total goodwill 1,519.1 1,449.7 Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash-generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash-generating units CGUs, within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
CGUs have been identified within our reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
Rokstad Power Corporation, a business based in British Columbia, Canada, has been integrated into the Groups Support services reporting segment and consequently the provisional goodwill recognised on this acquisition has been allocated to the Canada services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use in 2014 was determined on a similar basis to2013.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2014 in the light of the challenging economic environment.
The impact of macro-economic factors on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specificto the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has four CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East areconsistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support servicesCGUs are consistent and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the pre-tax discount rate management has derived a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt after adjusting for taxation.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment was 11.0 per cent 2013: 10.0 per cent and for the CGUs in the Support services segment was 9.7 per cent 2013:8.8 per cent.
The cash flows used to determine the value-in-use calculations are based upon the latest three-year forecasts approved by management, which arebased upon secured and probable orders and the Groups overall strategic direction.
The cash flows are extrapolated from year four, with a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term industry average and reflects the synergies fromrecent acquisitions.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis on a number of key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to a minimum of 17.3 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to a minimum of 13.6 per cent for Support services before an impairment was triggered in any CGU.
Sensitivity analysis was applied to the cash flows used to determine the value-in-use by reducing the approved three-year forecasts for the UK Construction CGU and UK services CGU by 20 per cent, together with an assumption of no growth in cash flows from year four onwards.
On the basis of the sensitivity analysis undertaken in relation to cash flows, management concluded that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom in the value-in-use calculations before an impairment would be triggered.
Overall, asat31December 2014, based on internal valuations, management has concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.

In December 2014, the Group issued 170 million of unsecured convertible bonds maturing by December 2019 with a coupon of 2.5 per cent payable semi-annually in arrears.
The initial conversion price has been set at 398.56 pence and upon conversion Carillion may elect to settle its obligations by way of delivery of ordinary shares, payment of a cash alternative amount or a combination of the two.
At inception, the proceeds from the convertible bond comprised a derivative liability component of 13.4 million and a debt component of 156.6 million.
The embedded derivative component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company or to settle in cash and is calculated using a Black Scholes or similar bespoke model.
The fair value of the debt component is calculated as the difference between the proceeds from the issue and the fair value of the embedded derivative component.
The debt component at 31 December 2014 amounted to 156.7 million and included 0.1 million of interest accretion.
Bank loans and overdrafts are largely unsecured and bear interest at floating rates linked to London Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate.
Within bank loans are loans amounting to 8.0 million 2013: 8.9 million which are secured on the assets to which they relate.
Finance lease obligations are secured on the assets to which they relate.

Share capital 2014 2013 Number Number million m million m Issued and fully paid At 1 January and 31 December 430.3 215.1 430.3 215.1 The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no right to fixed income.
In December 2014, the Group issued 170 million of unsecured convertible bonds.
The bonds mature by December 2019, and upon conversion, Carillion may elect to settle its obligations by way of delivery of ordinary shares, payment of a cash alternative or a combination of the two.
The initial conversion price has been set at 398.56 pence and upon conversion could lead to the issue of up to 42.7 million new shares, representing 9.9 per cent of the current issued share capital.
Reserves Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve initially arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011, whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The 13.7 million 2013: 18.6million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amounts realised following the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem, Alfred McAlpine and Carillion Energy Services acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2014 2013 m m At 1 January Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 0.5 1.4 Acquisition of own shares 0.5 1.4 At 31 December At 31 December 2014, the ESOP held 7 2013: 7 of the Companys shares and had a market value of 24 2013: 23.
During the year the Company acquired 118,578 of its own shares for 0.5 million to meet the plans commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
The Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2014 the total number of shares held by the QUEST amounted to 84,593 2013: 84,593 and had a market value of 0.3 million 2013: 0.4 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
In addition to the credit transferred from the merger reserve of 13.7 million noted above, a credit of 0.1 million has been transferred from non-controlling interests following the buy-out of certain non-controlling interests during the year.

Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 52 to 68.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, senior employees and Executive Directors receive a proportion of their bonus in shares, which vest a year after the award in respect of senior employees and three years after the award in respect of Executive Directors.

The Group treats guarantees and counter indemnities of this nature as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the terms of the arrangement.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
There are no liabilities of joint ventures for which the Group is contingently liable.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to financial risk orthe manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from theimpact of foreign exchange rate volatility, the Groups policy is that foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies, or where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
The Group has US$280 million of private placement finance at fixed interest rates from a number of United States of America based investors in order to provide greater flexibility in relation to the maturity profile of Group borrowing.
The Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility in relation to the associated capital and interest payments.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless a distribution is planned.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the Performance and financial review on page 35.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2014 2013 m m United States of America dollar 195.6 184.0 Canadian dollar 95.2 80.5 United Arab Emirates dirham 7.9 7.4 Other 2.8 3.0 301.5 274.9 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 292.8 million 2013: 274.9 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net asset amounts to 78.3 million 2013: 78.4 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 0.1 million 2013: 3.3 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
Exposure to United States of America dollar denominated private placement borrowing included above amounting to 179.5 million 2013: 168.7 million is hedged by crosscurrency derivative instruments as disclosed on page 107.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America dollar 0.8 0.8 Canadian dollar 5.7 6.2 Euro 2.0 2.3 United Arab Emirates dirham 0.2 3.4 0.2 3.8 Oman rials 0.6 3.0 0.7 3.4 Other 0.1 1.2 0.1 1.3 Interest rate risk The Groups interest-bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
Foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate or the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate.
In addition, the Group has secured additional finance of 314.5 million from private placements and 170 million from the issue of convertible bonds at fixed rates of interest, as disclosed in note 20.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates is to ensure that a proportion of the Groups borrowing was not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
This has been supplemented by a fixed rate interest swap, which swaps the floating rate to a fixed rate on 38million of the Groups principal bank facilities.
In addition, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.5 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 2.3 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan facility and bilateral facilities supplemented by private placement financing, convertible bonds and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2014 was 450.7 million 2013: 490.6 million.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the 31 December by geographic region was: 2014 2013 m m United Kingdom 153.0 155.6 Middle East 35.3 33.0 Canada 53.7 29.6 Rest of the World 0.1 1.5 242.1 219.7 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 106 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 27.

Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2014 2013 Net trade Net trade receivables Impairment receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 152.9 122.4 Past due less than three months 67.2 0.2 54.3 0.2 Past due between three and six months 6.4 0.3 24.1 0.4 Past due between six and 12 months 7.5 0.2 11.5 0.8 Past due more than 12 months 8.1 6.1 7.4 6.5 242.1 6.8 219.7 7.9 The movement in the impairment provision is as follows: 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 7.9 10.3 Provision acquired 0.1 Provision created 0.3 0.2 Provision utilised 1.4 2.7 At 31 December 6.8 7.9 Whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased due to the prevailing economic climate, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2014.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

A 8.2 million gain 2013: 6.1 million loss has been recognised in the hedging reserve in relation to the forward foreign currency contracts, fixed rate interest derivatives and the cross-currency derivatives which are effective cash flow hedges.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP joint ventures are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range up until February 2040.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within joint ventures in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2014 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP joint ventures amounted to 14.4 million 2013: 67.4 million of which 3.7 million 2013: 2.8 million and the related deferred tax asset of 0.8 million 2013: 0.7million has been recognised in the hedging reserve in 2014.

Financial instruments continued Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-quoted equity shareholdings within non-current asset investments, derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of the Rokstad Power Corporation as disclosed in note 30.
The fair value of non-current asset investments and contingent consideration payable is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available-for-sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of contingent consideration payable is calculated by discounting the maximum contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The movement in the fair value of financial instruments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: Non-current Contingent asset consideration investments m m At 1 January 2014 7.3 Additions 48.7 1.2 Fair value of equity interests retained on partial disposal 0.7 Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 0.1 At 31 December 2014 48.7 9.3 The fair value of non-current asset investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 0.4 million.
In respect of contingent consideration, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value of the liability by 1.9 million.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets.
There are no material differences between the fair value and the carrying value of the Groups principal financial instruments.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Where the Group makes significant acquisitions, these are financed with a combination of debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure.
In order to have greater flexibility over the maturity profile of debt, the Group has secured 314.5 million of private placement financing with maturity dates between 2017 and 2024 and 170 million of convertible bonds that mature in 2019.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with underlying earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31December2013.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2014 On 24 December 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of a 60 per cent equity shareholding in Rokstad Power Corporation Rokstad.
Rokstad is a Canadian powerlines and transmission business operating primarily in British Columbia and Alberta and provides the Group with access to markets with strong growth opportunities and where the Group can utilise its expertise.
The total cash consideration for this acquisition of around 31 million is dependent on the financial performance of Rokstad.
The consideration is payable in instalments over the period to July 2017, with 11.1 million paid on completion, which is included in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of net debt acquired.
Approximately 7.5 million is expected to be paid in 2015.
The remaining instalments to be paid in 2016 and 2017, which are dependent on financial performance, will be capped at a combined total of 12 million.
Under the acquisition agreement, Carillion has also committed to acquire the remaining 40 per cent interest in Rokstad after five years at a multiple of 4.5 times Rokstads 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, capped at a maximum additional consideration of 42 million.
The fair value of the deferred and contingent consideration payable, including the amount to acquire the remaining 40 per cent, is included within liabilities in the balance sheet and is derived from inputs that are not observable in the market.
Consequently, the fair value has been determined using the maximum contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate of 3.4 per cent.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition of Rokstad to the year end, a provisional assessment has been made of the fair value of the net liabilities acquired of 2.8 million.
This is after a fair value adjustment to goodwill on the Rokstad acquisition balance sheet of 5.7 million, which under International Financial Reporting Standards is reclassified at the same value as goodwill on Carillions balance sheet, and provisional fair value adjustments totalling 5.1 million.
On the basis of this assessment the provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition amounts to 70.1 million.
These provisional assessments are expected to become final in the first half of 2015 following the finalisation of the completion accounts process.
On 1 July 2014, following a change to the shareholder agreement, the Group obtained control of CarillionAmey Housing Prime Limited, an entity that was previously subject to joint control.
The principal change made to the shareholder agreement was the ability of the Group to appoint the Chairman of the Board with a casting vote on key operational decisions.
As a result, the Group has control over the entity and has therefore accounted for this change as a deemed step acquisition.
No consideration has been paid and there has been no change to the Groups 67 per cent equity interest in the entity.
The acquisition date fair value of the Groups equity interest already held in CarillionAmey Housing Prime Limited amounted to 8.4 million.
No gain or loss was recognised as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity interest already held.
An intangible asset of 2.4 million, representing customer contracts, has been recognised on this deemed acquisition.
No goodwill has been recognised.
Non-controlling interests at the acquisition date amounted to 3.2 million representing the proportionate interest in the net assets of the company at the acquisition date.
The above acquisitions are individually immaterial and therefore the disclosures below are prepared on an aggregated basis: Provisional recognised values m Property, plant and equipment 7.2 Intangible assets 2.5 Deferred tax assets 1.2 Trade and other receivables 78.6 Net cash and cash equivalents 6.6 Borrowing 10.9 Trade and other payables 61.8 Income tax 0.9 Deferred tax liabilities 0.5 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 8.8 Goodwill recognised on acquisition 70.1 Total consideration 78.9 Based on a provisional assessment of the recognised values of assets and liabilities, goodwill arising on the acquisition of Rokstad amounted to 70.1 million.
The goodwill recognised represents the benefits of cost savings expected to arise from the elimination of duplication, the potential for cross-selling opportunities within the enlarged Group and access to markets that have significant growth prospects.
The fair value of the consideration for the above acquisitions is analysed below: m Cash paid 11.1 Deferred consideration 7.5 Contingent consideration 48.7 Deemed consideration for previously held interest 8.4 Non-controlling interest acquired 3.2 Total fair value of consideration 78.9 Cash flows associated with the acquisition of subsidiaries included in the cash flow statement are analysed below: 2014 2013 m m Cash paid 11.1 Net cash and cash equivalents acquired 6.6 Payments in respect of acquisitions in prior years see page 111 8.6 20.3 Net cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries 26.3 20.3 In respect of acquired receivables, the gross contractual amounts receivable are 82.2 million.

Acquisitions and disposals continued Acquisitions in the year have not had a material impact on revenue or profit of the Group since the date of acquisition.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, total revenue would have been 4,207.0 million and profit before tax would have been 146.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Acquisitions in 2013 On 18 October 2013, the Group acquired the entire share capital of John Laing Integrated Services JLIS for a cash consideration of 17.5 million.
The consideration paid is shown in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of the cash acquired, after deducting cash on the acquisition balance sheet, amount to 4.1 million.
The provisional assessment of goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition amounts to 4.3 million and 27.2 million respectively.
The acquisition complements the Groups existing support services activities in the UK local government, education, police, health, rail and library sectors.
Due to the immaterial nature of this acquisition, the full disclosures required under International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
During 2013, the Group paid the second instalment relating to the acquisition of the Bouchier Group, which completed in 2012, amounting to 6.9 million.
In January 2014, the Group paid the final instalment amounting to 8.6 million.
The total consideration paid in respect of this acquisition was 20.4 million compared to the provisional estimate made in 2012 of 23.8 million.
Disposals in 2014 In 2014, the Group disposed of equity interests in four Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 37.0 million, which together with disposal costs paid of 1.0 million, is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint venture and other investments, and an operating profit of 13.9 million which is included in Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership projects segment.
Disposals in 2013 In 2013, the Group disposed of equity interests in a number of Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 151.2 million of which 6.4 million was received on exchange of contracts in 2012, which together with disposal costs paid of 1.1 million is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint venture and other investments, and an operating profit of 44.6 million which is included in the Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership Projects segment.
During 2013, the Group made cash payments of 0.3 million in relation to the disposal of businesses that occurred in prior years.
Retirement benefit obligations The Carillion Group operates 15 defined benefit pension schemes for eligible employees, of which 13 are in the UK, one is in Canada and one is in the Republic of Ireland.
In addition, the Group provides other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
The defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards which largely comprise independent Trustees together with Company and employee representatives.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Companys assets and are managed by the Trustee Boards.
Pension scheme valuations are carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding every three years and bi-annually to calculate the IAS 19 deficit included in the financial statements.
Eight of the 15 defined benefit schemes within the Group are closed to future accrual, with payments into these schemes made in line with deficit recovery plans, which have been agreed with pension scheme trustees.
The different scheme characteristics can be summarised below: 2014 2013 Assets Obligations Total Assets Obligations Total m m m m m m Schemes closed to future accrual 1,775.6 2,194.5 418.9 1,646.1 1,943.9 297.8 Open schemes 544.8 625.0 80.2 490.1 553.4 63.3 1 Unfunded schemes 10.6 10.6 9.0 9.0 Total 2,320.4 2,830.1 509.7 2,136.2 2,506.3 370.1 1 Unfunded schemes relate to other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 18.7 million 2013: 23.2 million represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified by the scheme rules.
IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2014 2013 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.55% N A 3.90% N A Rate of increase in pensions 2.95% 2.00% 3.30% 2.25% Inflation rate Retail Price Index 3.05% 2.00% 3.40% 2.25% Inflation rate Consumer Price Index 2.00% N A 2.35% N A Discount rate 3.70% 3.85% 4.60% 4.60% The valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is most sensitive to changes in the discount, inflation and mortality rates.
A 0.1 per cent reduction in the discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 48 million, whilst a 0.1 per cent increase in the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 41 million.
An increase of one year to the mortality rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 76 million, although this has been mitigated in part through the purchase of a longevity swap.
The overall weighted average duration of scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2014 is approximately 18 years.
Over the next five years benefits of 530 million are expected to be paid and benefits of 613 million are expected to be paid over the subsequent five-year period.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
Theassumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

In 2014, the triennial actuarial valuations as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2013 for five of the Groups schemes were concluded with the Trustees and a revised deficit recovery plan agreed.
This included the three largest schemes in the Group, namely the Carillion Staff, Mowlem Staff and Alfred McAlpine Staff schemes.
It was agreed with the Trustees that the actuarial valuation due as at 31 December 2014 be brought forward to 31 December 2013.
The total assets at the date of the 31 December 2013 actuarial valuation for all five schemes amounted to 1.8 billion, which represented a funding level of 76 per cent.
The next actuarial valuation for these schemes is due as at 31 December 2016.
In addition, the triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 of the Carillion Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme was agreed with the Trustees.
The assets in the scheme at the date of the valuation amounted to 67.4 million, which represented a funding level of 69 per cent.
The next actuarial valuation of the scheme is due as at 31 March 2016.
The Group expects to make payments totalling 51.8 million to defined benefit schemes during the next financial year.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31.
Retirement benefit obligations continued During 2013, a longevity swap was entered into by five of the Groups defined benefit schemes which insures the Group against the financial risk ofpensioners in payment living longer than currently expected.
The swap covers around 9,000 pensioners with a combined liability of some 1billion, which represents around 40 per cent of the total liabilities in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The swap was entered intoinDecember 2013 and in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Retirement benefits has been recognised as part of scheme assets.
At 31 December 2014, the fair value of the longevity swap calculated in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement was a 1.6 million liability 2013:nil, with the movement in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Revenue recognition In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out-turn on contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefits In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group, have been made in relation to: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pension increases.
Details of the assumptions used, together with sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rate are included in note 31.
