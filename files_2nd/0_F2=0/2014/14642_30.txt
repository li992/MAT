SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THIS SECTION INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment, the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 to the Group financial statements.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the Company.
KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES The Companys investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries assets based on fair values calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 of the Group financial statements.
