Warning to shareholders Over the last year, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a connection to the company concerned.
These are typically from overseas-based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA formerly the Financial Services Authority has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at adiscount or offers of free reports into the Company.
