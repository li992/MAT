2 Included within transfers, acquisitions and disposals is 550 million of cash consideration paid from life operations to other non-life operations within the Group for the sale of Aviva Life & Pensions Ireland Limited and Aviva Powszechne Towarzystwo Emerytalne BZ WBK S. A.
Further analysis of the movement in the liabilities of the long-term business can be found in notes 41 and 42.
The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 2,111 million this is known as RIEESA at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013: 1,105 million held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis, therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
The with-profit funds and the RIEESA use internal hedging to limit the impacts of equity market volatility.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 22.2 billion 2013: 18.6 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year-end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds have available capital of 3.9 billion 2013: 3.2 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital including RIEESA is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore no further support is required by shareholders.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 18.3 billion 2013: 15.4 billion is higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
The total available capital of 22.2 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently and includes the Groups unallocated divisible surplus of overseas life operations.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the PRAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the PRAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the PRA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.
