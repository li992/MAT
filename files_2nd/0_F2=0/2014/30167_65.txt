TSB Banking Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 91 Strategic report Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information To allow the Group to reach more customers and help them to borrow well, it invested in its mortgage business through the successful implementation of the Mortgage Market Review MMR in the first half of 2014, and more recently with the launch of anew intermediary channel that will support its core growth aspirations.
Mortgages composition by rate type The composition of the Franchise portfolio by rate type has changed modestly during 2014.
The Group ceased offering standard variable rate mortgages SVR as the standard reversionary rate from June 2010, replacing this product with the homeowner variable rate HVR mortgage.
Consequently, the SVR book continues to decrease as customers repay or remortgage from this product.
SVR mortgages now represent 61.4% of total Franchise mortgages, down from 65.9% at December 2013 with HVR increasing to 8.1% 2013: 5.2%.
The continuing low interest rate environment has resulted in an increase in the portfolio share of fixed rate mortgages to 19.3% 2013: 16.4%.
The proportion of the portfolio represented by tracker mortgages has reduced as aresult of lower demand in the current economic environment, and as customers revert to the HVR product at the end of their initial tracker term.
All applicants for new interest only lending are fully assessed to ensure that asuitable method of repayment is in place to repay their mortgage at maturity.
For existing interest only customers, the Group has acontact programme in place designed to ensure they have asuitable mortgage repayment vehicle already in place, or have the opportunity to take steps to avoid apotential repayment shortfall.

Counterparty credit risk A counterparty to atransaction which fails to honour its obligations under acontract as they fall due is considered to be a counterparty credit risk.
This typically relates to contracts for financial instruments including derivative contracts and repurchase agreements.
As aconsequence of hedging market risk with other financial counterparties and placing surplus liquidity with appropriate counterparties, including the Bank of England, the Group has credit exposures to these counterparties.
As part of managing counterparty credit risk, the Group transacts with counterparties that have external obligor ratings equivalent to an investment grade, as measured by external credit rating agencies.
In addition, robust due diligence is undertaken, obtaining appropriate internal approvals and setting appropriate counterparty credit limits.
The taking of collateral and various risk mitigation techniques, such as break clauses on an ad hoc basis, are also used in the course of business.
As part of our governance, the counterparty credit risk policy requires that an appropriate master agreement is put in place for all counterparties, prior to trading, any exceptions being subject to specific approval from asenior credit risk officer.
