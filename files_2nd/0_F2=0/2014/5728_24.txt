Corporate Information These separate financial statements of EVRAZ plc were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 31 March 2015.

The company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 with the registered number 7784342.
The Companys registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew Street, London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
As a result of the reorganisation implemented by way of the share exchange offer made by the Company for the shares of Evraz Group S. A. on 7 November 2011, the Company became a new parent entity of Evraz Group S. A. a joint stock company registered in Luxembourg in 2004.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries the Group, is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related products and coal and iron ore mining.
In addition, the Group produces vanadium products.
The Group is one of the largest steel producers globally.
Lanebrook Limited Cyprus is the ultimate controlling party of the Group.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application as of 31 December 2014, but not adopted by the European Union, are not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties which could create a significant doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation and functional currency of the Company is the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in US dollar at the rate on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are initially recorded at acquisition cost.
Writedowns are recorded if, in the opinion of the management, there is any impairment in value.
The cost of the investment in Evraz Group S. A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items of Evraz Group S. A. as a separate legal entity at the date of the reorganisation Note 3. Dividend income is recognised as revenue when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date when the investment is delivered to or by the Company.
Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, are classified as available-for-sale: these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are included in current assets.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations.
Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the statement of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

The Company acquired Evraz Group S. A. in 2011 by means of the share exchange offer made by the Company to the shareholders of Evraz Group S. A. which were entitled to receive 9 shares of EVRAZ plc for each share of Evraz Group S. A.
The cost of investments in Evraz Group S. A. was measured at the carrying amount of the equity items shown in the separate accounts of Evraz Group S. A. at the dates of share exchange.
In 2013, the Company made a cash contribution to the share capital of Evraz Group S. A. for a total amount of $100million.
In addition, the Company recognises share-based payments made to employees of subsidiaries under control of Evraz Group S. A. as an addition to the cost of its investments in Evraz Group S. A.
In 2014 and 2013, share-based compensations amounted to $30million and $25million.
In 2012, the Company made a cash contribution to the share capital of EVRAZ Greenfield Development S. A. EGD in the amount of $248million.
This contribution was used by EGD for the purchase of a 60.016% share in the Mezhegey coal field project from Mastercroft Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, for $245million.
In 2013, the Company made cash contributions to the share capital of EGD for a total amount of $357million.
Subsequently in 2013, when external financing was received, EGD decreased the share capital by $300million and returned this amount to the Company in cash.
As such, the net investment in the subsidiary amounted to $305million.
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Company assessed the recoverability of its investment in EGD.
The recoverable amount of the asset was based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the business plans approved by management and an appropriate discount rate reflecting time value of money and risks associated with the asset.
The discount rates were 18.36% and 13.72% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
As a result, in 2013, the Company recognised an impairment loss of $171million.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the changes in expectations of long-term prices for coal and the decrease in the sales volumes.
In 2014, $120million impairment loss was reversed due to the increased estimation of the value in use of the subsidiary as a result of the improved technological methods of development of the project and better quality of coal than the originally estimated.
Corber Enterprises S. a r. l. On 16 January 2013, EVRAZ plc acquired a 50% ownership interest in Corber Enterprises S. a r. l.

Fair value of the consideration transferred totalled to $964million, including $611million relating to the shares issued, $156million representing the fair value of the warrants and $197million being the present value of the cash component of the purchase consideration.
The fair value of shares and warrants was determined by reference to the market value of EVRAZ plc shares at the date of acquisition.
In 2013, the Company paid $101million relating to this acquisition.

As a result, in 2014 the Company recognised an impairment loss of $543million, which was all recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and transferred out of the merger reserve.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the increase in the discount rate and the planned temporary stoppage of one of the largest mines of Raspadskaya MUK-96 due to unfavourable coal prices.
OJSC Mining and Metallurgical Company Timir On 3 April 2013, the Company acquired a 51% ownership interest in the joint venture with Alrosa for the development of 4 iron ore deposits in the southern part of the Yakutia region in Russia.
The Companys consideration for this stake amounted to $149million being the present value of the expected cash outflows at the exchange rate as of 31 December 2013.
The consideration denominated in roubles is payable in instalments till 15 July 2014.
In 2014 and 2013, the Company recognised within interest expense $2million and $7million, respectively, representing the unwinding of the discount on this liability.
In 2014 and 2013, the Group paid 990million roubles $28million and 1,980million roubles $61million, respectively, of purchase consideration.
In July 2014, the parties agreed to amend the payment schedule and postponed two instalments of 990million roubles each in total $35million at the exchange rate as of 31 December 2014 until 31 July 2015 and 2016.
From the date of the amendment the Group incurred interest charges on the unpaid liability at a rate of 8.5% per annum.
These charges amounted to $3million in 2014, out of which $1million was paid.

As a result, in 2014 and 2013, the Company recognised impairment losses of $47million and $10million, respectively.
The major driver that led to impairment was the changes in expectations of long-term prices for iron ore. Any change to the key assumptions in the value in use calculations could materially impact the recoverable value and result in further impairment or a reversal of previously recognised impairment.
For further analysis of these key assumptions please refer to Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.
Additional information is provided in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
Financial Assets In December 2014, the Company purchased certain bonds of Raspadskaya, an indirect subsidiary, on the market.
