Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible Assets have been satisfied.
The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from the appropriate regulatory body.
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement.
If the arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited circumstances where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38.
By contrast, the payments are capitalised if the arrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party.
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs Expenditure on advertising costs is expensed as incurred.

These amounts were fully matched in the income statement by the fair value gains or losses on currency swaps carried at fair value through profit and loss held to manage this currency risk.
5 Taxation ACCOUNTING POLICY The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any time the Group has un-agreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take many years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future: on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill: and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

126 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 6 Earnings per ordinary share ACCOUNTING POLICIES Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees Share Trust or as treasury shares.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure.
The Group has identified the following items as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and impairments: significant restructuring events: significant gains and losses arising from legal disputes and significant uninsured losses: and taxation thereon.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 127 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 7 Property, plant and equipment ACCOUNTING POLICIES Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment is 320 years and for buildings is 2050 years.
Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are available for use.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs.
All other finance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Assets held under finance leases with a net book amount of $8m 2013 $10m are included within land and buildings.
The impairment charge in the year relates to certain assets which related to the production of HP802, which the Group has decided not to continue.
Historically, capital expenditure represents the Groups expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.
This varies between 6% and 8% 2013 6% and 8% of annual revenue.
Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $27m 2013 $20m.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in 2014 and 2013 was minimal.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 8 Goodwill ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.
The CGUs, monitored by management, are at the business segment level, Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

Each of the Groups business segments represent a CGU and include goodwill as follows: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Advanced Surgical Devices 1,686 918 Advanced Wound Management 341 338 2,027 1,256 In September 2014 and 2013 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in-line with the Groups strategic planning process.
The calculation of value-in-use for the identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: The discount rate reflects managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Surgical Devices business is 10% 2013 10% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 11% 2013 10%.
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered annual revenue growth.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period for the Advanced Surgical Devices business franchises vary from 2% to 15% 2013 1% to 20% and for the Advanced Wound Management business franchises from 4% to 19% 2013 2% to 22%.
130 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Specific considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading profit margin for each CGU are: Advanced Surgical Devices Management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on widening access to the customer, strengthening our portfolio and global presence, innovative product development and through continuing to make efficiency improvements Advanced Wound Management Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on widening access to the customer, the higher added value sectors of healing chronic wounds and tissue repair using bioactives, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
Following the detailed first 5 years, management has used an unchanged size of the market and Groups share thereof in the pre-tax cash flows used to calculate the terminal value of both the Advanced Surgical Devices business 2013 increase at 3% per year and Advanced Wound Management businesses 2013 increase at 5% per year, which were considered to be the Groups CGUs in 2014.
Management has considered the following sensitivities: Growth of market and market share Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share.
The value-inuse calculation shows that if the assumed long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs independently would still be greater than their carrying values Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value-in-use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 28% 2013 33% for the Advanced Surgical Devices business and 17% 2013 65% for the Advanced Wound Management business.
9 Intangible assets ACCOUNTING POLICIES Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights are initially measured at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination referred to as acquisition intangibles is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature.
Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets.
Software that is integral to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.

ii The majority of this balance relates to technology and product rights acquired with ArthroCare Corp, which are being amortised over 6-20 years.
Group capital expenditure relating to software contracted but not provided for amounted to $7m 2013 $21m.
The carrying values of acquisition intangibles are reviewed for impairment and it was noted that an intangible asset relating to a distribution agreement for a brand within our US Advanced Wound Management business had headroom which was highly sensitive to managements estimate of future related earnings growth.
Changes in those assumptions of either a decrease in the medium term growth rate from 4% to 1% or an increase in the discount rate of 1% to 11.1% would give rise to a $3 million impairment.
132 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 10 Investments ACCOUNTING POLICY Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs on the trade date.
The Group has an investment in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their very nature have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
The investment is classed as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
The fair value of the investment is based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market: nonmarketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price, prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities.
Objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost less any impairment loss previously recognised.
Impairment losses are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in other reserves to profit or loss.
2014 2013 $ million $ million At 1 January 2 2 Additions 4 Distribution 1 At 31 December 5 2 11 Investments in associates ACCOUNTING POLICY Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associates profit and loss and other comprehensive income.
The Groups share of associates profit or loss is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated after deduction of their respective taxes.
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group holds 49% of Bioventus LLC Bioventus.
Bioventus is a limited liability company operating as a partnership.
The Companys headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina, US.
Bioventus focuses its medical product development around its core competencies of orthobiologic therapies and orthopaedic diagnostics from which it develops and markets clinically proven orthopaedic therapies and diagnostic tools, including osteoarthritis pain treatments, bone growth stimulators and ultrasound devices.
Bioventus sells bone stimulation devices and is a provider of osteoarthritis injection therapies.
The loss after taxation recognised in the income statement relating to Bioventus was $2m 2013 loss after taxation $2m.
The carrying amount of this investment was reviewed for impairment as at the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable amount of this investment was based on its fair value less cost to sell, estimated using discounted cash flows.
The fair value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value based on the inputs and valuation technique used.
In addition to its 49% ownership interest in Bioventus, the Group held a senior secured five year loan note with Bioventus.
The loan note was created in May 2012 with a principal amount of $160m and an annual coupon rate of LIBOR plus 5%.
In October 2014, the loan note of $160 million plus $28m of accrued interest was repaid by Bioventus following a successful external refinancing.
The Group continues to hold 49% of investor equity in Bioventus.

At December 2014, the Group holds equity investments in two other associates 2013 none which are immaterial.
The Groups aggregate carrying amount of these investments at 31 December 2014 is $7m 2013 nil and the Groups aggregate share of profits from these investments was $nil 2013 nil.
The Groups share of loss in 2013 includes a gain of $1m from two Austrian associates.
The Group disposed of the Austrian associates during the year ended 31 December 2013.
12 Inventories ACCOUNTING POLICY Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis.
Raw materials and bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost.
Inventory acquired as part of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts.
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery.
They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and five years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use referred to as consignment inventory.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness ofinventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

The decrease in reserves of $37m in the year comprised releases of $29m, inventory write-offs of $4m and foreign exchange movements of $4m.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $1,013m 2013 $958m, 2012 $906m.
In addition, $55m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from inventory write offs 2013 $73m, 2012 $84m.
Notwithstanding inventory acquired within acquisitions, no inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.
134 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 13 Trade and other receivables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed.
Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case.
Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers and geographies.
Furthermore the Groups principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium term cash forecasts, having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
The Group has available committed facilities of $2.5bn 2013 $1.7bn.
The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is either at fixed or floating rates.
Floating rates are typically based on the LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the term and currency concerned.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under its principal facility agreements.
These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period.
As of 31 December 2014, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The facilities are also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.

Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 139 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 15 Cash and borrowings continued 15.6 Finance leases ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Within one year 3 3 After one and within two years 3 3 After two and within three years 3 3 After three and within four years 3 3 After four and within five years 3 3 After five years 3 Total minimum lease payments 15 18 Discounted by imputed interest 3 4 Present value of minimum lease payments 12 14 Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m 2013 $2m due within one year, $10m 2013 $9m due between one to five years and $nil 2013 $3m due after five years.
16 Financial instruments and risk management ACCOUNTING POLICY Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
140 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in over 100 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further 12-month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1.5bn 2013 $1.6bn.
Based on the Groups net borrowings as at 31 December 2014, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would decrease by $6m 2013 decrease by $2m as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated cash than foreign denominated borrowings.
In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $1m 2013 increase by $4m.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2014 would have been $37m lower 2013 $34m.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2014 would have been $26m higher 2013 $27m.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2014 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant.
In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
When required the Group uses interest rate derivatives to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate derivatives recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest rate derivatives match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2014, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $6m 2013 $4m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from one of the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2014 was $49m 2013 $29m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2014 was $93m 2013 $137m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 16 Financial instruments and risk management continued 16.4 Currency and interest rate profile of interest bearing liabilities and assets Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded from the following disclosures.
Currency and Interest Rate Profile of Interest Bearing Liabilities: Fixed rate liabilities Weighted Weighted average average time Gross Currency Total Floating Fixed Interest for which borrowings swaps liabilities rate liabilities rate liabilities rate rate is fixed $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million % Years At 31 December 2014: US Dollar 1,685 208 1,893 826 1,067 3.4 8.3 Euro 10 35 45 45 Other 10 37 47 47 Total interest bearing liabilities 1,705 280 1,985 918 1,067 At 31 December 2013: US Dollar 297 77 374 360 14 7.1 4 Euro 59 28 87 87 Other 35 40 75 75 Total interest bearing liabilities 391 145 536 522 14 At 31 December 2014, $12m 2013 $14m of fixed rate liabilities relate to finance leases.
In 2014, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition consideration denominated in US Dollars and Brazilian Real totalling $33m 2013 $21m, 2012 $8m on which no interest was payable see Note 14.
There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the currency concerned.
The weighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2014 was 1% 2013 1%.
Currency and Interest Rate Profile of Interest Bearing Assets: Cash Currency Floating at bank swaps Total assets rate assets $ million $ million $ million $ million At 31 December 2014: US Dollars 13 79 92 92 Other 80 200 280 280 Total interest bearing assets 93 279 372 372 At 31 December 2013: US Dollars 8 69 77 77 Other 129 77 206 206 Total interest bearing assets 137 146 283 283 Floating rates on assets are typically based on the short-term deposit rates relevant to the currency concerned.

142 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities ACCOUNTING POLICY Measurement of fair values A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets acquired in a business combination see Note 21.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable data unobservable inputs.
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.
It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Carrying amount Fair value Designated Fair value Loans Other at fair hedging and Available financial value instruments receivables for sale liabilities Total Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2014 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Financial assets measured at fair value Forward foreign exchange contracts 48 48 48 48 Investments 5 5 5 5 Currency swaps 1 1 1 1 1 48 5 54 49 5 54 Financial liabilities measured at fair value Acquisition consideration 33 33 33 33 Forward foreign exchange contracts 19 19 19 19 Currency swaps 2 2 2 2 35 19 54 21 33 54 Financial assets not measured at fair value Trade and other receivables 1,117 1,117 Cash at bank 93 93 1,210 1,210 Financial liabilities not measured at fair value Bank overdrafts 28 28 Bank loans 540 540 Private placement debt 1,125 1,125 1,144 1,144 Finance lease liabilities 12 12 Trade and other payables 828 828 2,533 2,533 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 143 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 16 Financial instruments and risk management continued Carrying amount Fair value Designated Fair value Loans Other at fair hedging and Available financial value instruments receivables for sale liabilities Total Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2013 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Financial assets measured at fair value Forward foreign exchange contracts 28 28 28 28 Investments 2 2 2 2 Currency swaps 1 1 1 1 1 28 2 31 29 2 31 Financial liabilities measured at fair value Acquisition consideration 21 21 21 21 Forward foreign exchange contracts 20 20 20 20 21 20 41 20 21 41 Financial assets not measured at fair value Trade and other receivables 1,085 1,085 Cash at bank 137 137 1,222 1,222 Financial liabilities not measured at fair value Bank overdrafts 11 11 Bank loans 366 366 Finance lease liabilities 14 14 Trade and other payables 751 751 1,142 1,142 The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates.
As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the fair value of derivatives is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default risk.
The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario.
As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between level 1, 2 and 3 during 2014 and 2013.
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
As the Groups long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year-end.
144 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 17 Provisions and contingencies ACCOUNTING POLICY In the normal course of business the Group is involved in various legal disputes.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
For the purpose of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group has taken the discounted future lease payments, net of expected rental income.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A provision for rationalisation is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.
17.1 Provisions Rationalisation Legal and other provisions provisions Total $ million $ million $ million At 1 January 2013 25 97 122 Charge to income statement 15 22 37 Utilised 22 12 34 At 31 December 2013 18 107 125 Acquisitions 24 24 Charge to income statement 17 15 32 Utilised 22 28 50 Exchange adjustment 1 1 At 31 December 2014 12 118 130 Provisions due within one year 12 55 67 Provisions due after one year 63 63 At 31 December 2014 12 118 130 Provisions due within one year 18 42 60 Provisions due after one year 65 65 At 31 December 2013 18 107 125 The principal provisions within rationalisation provisions relate to the Group Optimisation programme mainly severance announced in May 2014 and people costs associated with the structural and efficiency programme announced in August 2011.
Included within the legal and other provisions are: A provision of $10m 2013 $nil relating to the distribution hold on RENASYS.
A provision of $7m 2013 $nil relating to the HP802 programme which was stopped in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various patent disputes and other litigation.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within three years of 31 December 2014 and none are treated as financial instruments.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 145 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 17 Provisions and contingencies continued 17.2 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages.
The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them are likely to result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated.
There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations in the period in which they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims.
Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims, and almost all have been resolved.
The aggregate cost at 31 December 2014 related to this matter is approximately $215m.
The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims.
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability.
However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters.
In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee.
An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17.3 Legal proceedings Product liability claims The Group faces other claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from the market.
Such claims are endemic to the orthopaedic device industry.
The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles that management believes are reasonable.
All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, and the Group has incurred and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area.
As of January 2015 approximately 930 such claims were pending with the Group around the world, of which 539 had given rise to pending legal proceedings.
Most of the pending legal proceedings are in the United States.
Most claims relate to the Groups Birmingham Hip Resurfacing BHR product and the Birmingham Hip Modular Head BHMH and R3 Metal Liner R3ML components.
In 2012, the Group restricted instructions for use of the BHMH and ceased offering the R3ML.
In 2013, the Groups US subsidiary agreed with lawyers representing metal-on-metal claimants to consolidate pre-trial proceedings such as discovery in their lawsuits in a state court in Memphis, Tennessee, and those lawsuits account for most of the US proceedings.
These lawsuits are being vigorously defended, but outcomes are difficult to predict and defence costs can be significant.
The Group takes care to monitor the clinical evidence relating to its metal hip implant products and ensure that its product offerings and training are designed to serve patients interests.
The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
In general, the insurers are investigating the claims and have reserved rights under their respective policies.
As noted above, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
Business practice investigations Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities.
From time to time authorities undertake investigations of the Groups activities to verify compliance.
In September 2007, the SEC notified the Group that it was conducting an informal investigation of companies in the medical devices industry, including the Group, regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA in connection with the sale of products in certain countries outside of the US.
The US Department of Justice DOJ subsequently joined the SECs request.
On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter.
Smith & Nephew paid slightly less than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement and committed to maintain an enhanced compliance programme and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.
The monitors final report was filed in late 2013, and the independent monitorship was terminated.
The settlement agreements had three-year terms.
The deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ expired on 6 February 2015 and the DOJ moved to dismiss a related court action against Smith & Nephew.
The agreement with the SEC is scheduled to expire on 3 March 2015.
Intellectual property disputes The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and other intellectual property matters.
These disputes are being heard in courts in the US and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents.
Outcomes are rarely certain and costs are often significant.
The Group has won a jury verdict in the US district court for Oregon against Arthrex Inc. for infringement of the Groups patents relating to suture anchors.
A number of issues have been disputed and appealed since the case was first filed in 2003: Arthrexs latest appeal was argued in January 2015.
Arthrex asserted other patents against the Group in 2014 in the US district court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Other matters In April 2009, the Group was served with a subpoena by the US Department of Justice in Massachusetts requiring the production of documents from 1995 to 2009 associated with the marketing and sale of the Groups EXOGEN bone growth stimulator.
Similar subpoenas have been served on a number of competitors in the bone growth stimulator market.
Around the same time a qui tam or whistle-blower complaint concerning the industrys sales and marketing of those products, originally filed in 2005 against the primary manufacturers of bone growth stimulation products including Smith & Nephew, was unsealed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts.
A motion to dismiss that complaint was denied in December 2010.
146 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION The Group is subject to country of origin requirements under the US Buy American and Trade Agreements Acts with regard to sales to certain US government customers.
In 2008 the Group voluntarily disclosed to the US Veterans Administration and the US Department of Defense that a small percentage of the products sold to the US government may have originated from countries that are not eligible for such sales except with government consent.
In December 2008, three months after Smith & Nephews initial voluntary disclosure, a whistle-blower suit was filed in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging these violations.
Smith & Nephews motion to dismiss the suit was denied in November 2010, and it was settled in 2014.
In January 2014, before agreeing to be acquired by the Group, ArthroCare announced a settlement of charges by the US DOJ relating to securities fraud in which certain members of prior management were implicated.
ArthroCare paid a $30m fine and signed a deferred prosecution agreement that imposes reporting, compliance and other requirements on ArthroCare for a two-year term.
18 Retirement benefit obligations ACCOUNTING POLICY The Groups major pension plans are of the defined benefit type.
A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary.
The Groups obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs of managing the plan assets.
The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income OCI and all other expenses, such as service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit and finance income costs.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
The discount rate is based on the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have a maturity profile approximately the same as the Groups obligations.
In determining these assumptions management take into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
18.1 Retirement benefit net assets obligations The Groups retirement benefit obligations comprise: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Funded plans: UK Plan 16 50 US Plan 74 65 Other Plans 42 28 132 143 Unfunded Plans: Other Plans 48 39 Retirement Healthcare 46 43 226 225 Amount recognised on the balance sheet liability 233 230 Amount recognised on the balance sheet asset 7 5 The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in 16 countries and these are established under the laws of the relevant country.
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In countries where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered by management to be adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement rage.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the year of service ofthe employee.
The Groups two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US.
Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined contribution plans are offered to new joiners.
The US Plan was closed to future accrual in March 2014.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 147 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 18 Retirement benefit obligations continued The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees.
This Board is composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The UK Plans assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation.
The main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the UK Plan are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increase and the actual longevity of the membership.
The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is composed of both plan participants and representatives of the Group.
In the US, the Pension Protection Act 2006 established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution.
Failure to contribute at least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have negative tax consequences.
The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

The US and UK plan assets are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies.
These assets include liability matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees of each plan, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities.
In December 2014, the low risk asset portfolio held by the UK Plan was transferred into liability driven investments LDI in order to maintain the same level of hedging against interest rate and inflation risks.
The UK Plan also has an insurance contract with Rothesay Life covering a subset of the UK Plan pensioner liabilities.
The terms of this policy define that the contract value exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract.
In accordance with IAS19R Employee Benefits, the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted at the AA corporate bond rate.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 18 Retirement benefit obligations continued 18.4 Expenses recognised in the income statement The total expense relating to retirement benefits recognised for the year is $17m 2013 $72m, 2012 $72m.
Of this cost recognised for the year, $32m 2013 $32m, 2012 $32m relates to defined contributions and $15m net income 2013 $40m expense, 2012 $40m expense relates to defined benefit plans.
The cost charged in respect of the Groups defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
These were charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses.
There were $nil outstanding payments as at 31 December 2014 due to be paid over to the plans 2013 $nil, 2012 $nil.
Included in the $15m net income recognised for defined benefits plans are a $35m past service cost credit which arose on the closure of the US plan to future accrual in March 2014 and a $11m gain on settlement of benefits as a result of a member buyout in December 2014.
Defined benefit plan costs comprise service cost which is charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses and net interest cost and administration costs and taxes which are reported as other finance costs.

The UK uses the S1NA with projections in line with the CMI 2011 table and the US uses the RP2000 table with scale AA.
The current longevities underlying the values of the obligations in the defined benefit plans are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 years years years Life expectancy at age 60 UK Plan: Males 29.4 29.3 28.7 Females 31.2 31.1 30.2 US Plan: Males 26.0 23.8 22.9 Females 28.5 25.5 25.0 Life expectancy at age 60 in 20 years time UK Plan: Males 32.4 32.2 31.2 Females 33.3 33.2 31.9 US Plan: Males 27.8 23.8 24.6 Females 30.2 25.5 25.0 18.6 Sensitivity analysis The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions used.
The following table summarises the increase decrease on the UK and US defined benefit obligation and pension costs as a result of reasonably possible changes in some of the assumptions while holding all other assumptions consistent.
The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increases and future pension increase assumptions.
The analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan.
Changes to the inflation assumption will not have any affect on the US Pension plan as it was closed to future accrual in 2014.

A decrease in the bond yield will increase the measure of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value ofmatching plan assets such as bonds and insurance contracts.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce interest rate risk.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation.
A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability.
This risk is managed by holding inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce inflation risk.
The US Plan has been closed to future accrual which eliminates the exposure to this risk.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the plan deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by a portfolio of liability matching assets and a bulk annuity, together with a dynamic fide risking policy to switch growth assets into liability matching assets over time.
The US Plan has a dynamic fide-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer term stable asset classes.
The policy established ten pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan assets are re-balanced accordingly.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, entered into an insurance contract which covers aportion of pensioner obligations.
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants.
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The exposure to salary risk in the US has been eliminated with the closure of the US Plan to future accrual.
18.8 Funding A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required.
Employer contributions rates, based on these full valuations, are agreed between the trustees of each plan and the Group.
The assumptions used in the funding actuarial valuations may differ from those assumptions above.
Employees are required to contribute to the plans.
UK Plan The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was undertaken as at 30 September 2012.
Valuations are performed every two years, however in 2014, the Trustees have agreed that they will defer the 2014 valuation for one year and it will be performed in September 2015.
This included supplementary payments of $23m 2013 $31m, 2012 $30m.
The Group has agreed to pay the supplementary payments each year until 2017.
The agreed supplementary contributions for 2015 are $37m.
US Plan Full actuarial valuations were performed annually for the US Plan with the last undertaken as at 20 September 2013 before the closure of the Plan to future accrual.
Contributions to the US Plan were $22m 2013 $20m, 2012 $27m which included supplementary payments of $20m.
The agreed contributions for 2015 are $22m.
152 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 19 Equity ACCOUNTING POLICY Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase inequity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.
They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and effectively have no value.
These rights are summarised as follows: The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company: The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Companys assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the deferred shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a deferred share foreach deferred share held by him an amount equal to the nominal value of the deferred share: The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company: and The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining the consent of the holders of the deferred shares.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements.
The Group reviews its capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows: 2014 2013 2012 $ million $ million $ million Share capital 184 184 193 Share premium 574 535 488 Capital redemption reserve 11 10 Treasury shares 315 322 735 Retained earnings and other reserves 3,586 3,640 3,938 4,040 4,047 3,884 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 19 Equity continued 19.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares represents the holding of the Companys own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employees Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the share buy-back programme.
On 2 May 2013, as part of the new Capital Allocation Framework, the Group announced the start of a new share buy-back programme to return $300m of surplus capital to its shareholders.
The programme was suspended in February 2014 following the annoucement of the ArthroCare acquisition.
Shares issued in connection with the Groups share incentive plans are brought back on a quarterly basis.
During 2014, a total of 4.4m ordinary shares 0.5% had been purchased at a cost of $72m and 4.4m ordinary shares 0.5% had been cancelled.
The maximum number of ordinary shares held in treasury during 2014 was 26.9m 2.8% with a nominal value of $5.4m.
The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees Share Trust Trust was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a loan from the Company.
The cost of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues.
A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect of those shares held under the long-term incentive plans.
The trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan shares.
The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
21.1 Acquisitions Year ended 31 December 2014 Acquisition of ArthroCare On 29 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of ArthroCare Corporation, an innovative medical device company with a highly complementary sports medicine portfolio.
The purchase price was $48.25 per share, paid in cash with the fair value of the total consideration equalling $1,715m.
The acquisition was financed through existing debt facilities and cash balances, including an existing $1 billion revolving credit facility and a new two-year $1.4 billion term loan facility, established in February 2014.
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The fair values shown below are provisional.
If new information is obtained within the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised.
The provisional estimate of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is $829m.
It relates to the value of the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including synergies and the assembled workforce.
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred, and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
$ million Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Property, plant and equipment 60 Inventories 66 Trade receivables and prepayments 54 Identifiable intangible assets 817 Investments in associates 4 Trade and other payables 74 Provisions 19 Current tax payable 18 Deferred tax liabilities 173 Net assets 717 Goodwill 829 Consideration net of $169m of cash acquired 1,546 The recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are different from those disclosed previously as adjustments to provisional values continue to be recorded during the measurement period.
None of the adjustments posted to date are material.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of $21m relating to professional and advisor fees.
These costs have been recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
ArthroCares contribution to Group revenue was $207m for the year ended 31 December 2014, representing approximately seven months of sales.
This gave rise to a pre-tax profit of $28m after amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
Had ArthroCare been acquired on 1 January 2014, the Groups revenues would have been $147m higher and pre-tax profit would have been $5m higher.
Acquisition of Brazilian distributor On 17 March 2014 the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities related to the distribution business for its sports medicine, orthopaedic reconstruction, and trauma products in Brazil.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration was $31m and included deferred consideration of $26m and $5m in relation to the settlement of working capital commitments.
The deferred consideration was subsequently settled during the second quarter.
156 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION As at the acquisition date, the estimated value of the net assets acquired was $16m, which included trade and other receivables of $12m, identifiable intangible assets of $16m, inventory of $4m, property, plant and equipment of $2m, trade payables of $1m, provisions of $5m, current tax payable of $4m and deferred tax liabilities of $8m.
As a result, the provisional estimate of goodwill arising on the acquisition was $15m.
This is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the acquisition, including the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as part of the acquisition.
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been determined on a provisional basis.
The contribution to revenue and attributable profit from this acquisition for the year ended 31 December 2014 was immaterial.
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the year its contribution to revenue and attributable profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 would also have been immaterial.
Year ended 31 December 2013 Acquisition of Turkish distributor On 30 September 2013, the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities in respect of a Turkish business, which distributes products related toorthopaedic reconstruction, trauma, sports medicine and arthroscopic technologies.
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3.
The estimated fair value of the consideration is $63m and included $12m of contingent consideration in respect of agreed milestones and $36m through the settlement of working capital commitments.
The accounting for acquisition was completed during 2014, with no change to the provisional values as at 31 December 2013.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is $12m.
It is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as part of the acquisition.
The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

These costs have been recognised in administrative expenses in the Groups income statement.
In 2013, the contribution to revenue and attributable profit from the acquisition was immaterial.
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning ofthe year the contribution to revenue and attributable profit would have also been immaterial.
Other acquisitions During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group acquired a Brazilian distributor of its advanced wound management products and a business based in India primarily engaged in the manufacture and distribution of trauma products.
These acquisitions are deemed to be business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3.
The aggregated total fair value of the consideration was $63m and included $2m of contingent consideration and $2m through the settlement of working capital commitments.
The accounting for both acquisitions was completed during 2014, with no change to the provisional values as at 31 December 2013.
As at the acquisition date, the aggregated fair value of the net assets acquired was $38 million, which included property, plant and equipment of $1m, inventory of $4m, trade receivables and prepayments of $3m, identifiable intangible assets of $47m, payables and accruals of $3m and deferred tax liabilities of $14m.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is $25m.
This is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transactions, including the assembled workforces, which have been transferred as part of the acquisitions.
In 2013, the contribution to revenue and attributable profit from these acquisitions was immaterial.

The 2014 revenue and profit contribution of the disposed business was immaterial.
22 Operating leases ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
Payments under operating leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases fall due as follows: 2014 2013 $ million $ million Land and buildings: Within one year 34 30 After one and within two years 25 22 After two and within three years 18 16 After three and within four years 12 13 After four and within five years 8 7 After five years 8 5 105 93 Other assets: Within one year 15 15 After one and within two years 9 9 After two and within three years 4 4 After three and within four years 3 2 31 30 158 Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 23 Other Notes to the accounts 23.1 Share-based payments ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models.
The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.

Executive plans The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001, the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004 and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010 are together termed the Executive Plans.
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or ordinary shares.
For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an ordinary share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or ordinary share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing price of an ordinary share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 is subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions.
Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan was open to certain employees in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally.
The 2004 Plan was open to Senior Executives only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share option plans are settled in shares.
From 2012 onwards Senior Executives were granted share awards instead of share options and from 2013 executives were granted conditional share awards instead of share options.
The awards vest 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year subject to continued employment.
There are no performance conditions for executives.
Vesting for senior executives is subject to personal performance levels.
The market value used to calculate the number of awards is the closing price of an ordinary share on the last trading day prior to the grant date.

Options granted under Employee Plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Employee plans Executive plans 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 1.5 1.5 Expected volatility % i 20.0 25.0 25.0 25.0 Risk free interest rate % ii 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.2 Expected life in years 3.9 3.8 3.8 10.0 i Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
ii The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.
Smith & Nephew Annual report 2014 161 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group accounts continued 23 Other Notes to the accounts continued 23.1 Share based payments continued Share-based payments long-term incentive plans In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives.
The plan included a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan was designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one-third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years ie one-third each year.
No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all Executives other than Executive Directors.
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives were replaced by Equity Incentive Awards EIA.
EIA are designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
EIA will vest, in equal annual tranches over three years ie one-third each year, subject to continued employment and personal performance.
No further performance conditions apply to the EIA.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
A correlation of 40% 2013 40%, 2012 35% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors.
The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of Free Cash Flow growth, Revenue in Emerging & International Markets and the Groups TSR performance over the three-year performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the Executive scheme assumptions disclosed earlier in this note.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of awards outstanding at 31 December 2014 was 1.1 years 2013 1.4 years, 2012 0.8 years for the PSP, nil years 2013 0.2 years, 2012 0.9 years for the Deferred Bonus Plan, 1.5 years 2013 1.8 years for the EIA and 2.0 years 2013 2.1 years, 2012 0.9 years for the other awards.
