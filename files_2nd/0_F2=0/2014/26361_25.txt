BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 187 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements NOTE 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and its predecessor body.
The EU endorsed version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, availableforsale financial assets, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 104, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which became effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IFRIC 21 Levies This interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a government levy is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy as set out in the relevant legislation and that an entitys expectation of operating in a future period, irrespective of the difficulties involved in exiting a market, does not create a constructive obligation to pay a levy.
The adoption of this interpretation has not had a material impact on these financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements for offsetting financial instruments and address inconsistencies identified in applying the offsetting criteria used in the standard.
In previous years the Group has separately reported, in the balance sheet, cash collateral balances and derivative positions with the same exchange: these cash collateral balances are now offset.
The effect of this at 31 December 2014 has been to reduce both loans and advances to customers and derivative liabilities by 2,820 million and both customer deposits and derivative assets by 2,294 million.
Comparative figures have been revised accordingly, the impact at 31 December 2013 being to reduce derivative assets by 2,321 million 31 December 2012: 923 million, loans and advances to customers by 2,329 million 31 December 2012: 461 million, customer deposits by 1,844 million 31 December 2012: 696 million and derivative liabilities by 2,806 million 31 December 2012: 688 million.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2014 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 57.
NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently.
A CONSOLIDATION The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including structured entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power.
This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in note 9 to the parent company financial statements.
The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund.
Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle including: an assessment of the scope of the Groups decision making authority over the investment vehicle: the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager: the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker: and the Groups exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle.
Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest.
Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities.
Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity: its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity: the nature of the relationship with the entity: and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.
188 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The treatment of transactions with noncontrolling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any noncontrolling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see E 5 below or share capital see R 1 below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each year to reflect the Groups share of the postacquisition results of the joint venture or associate based on audited accounts which are coterminous with the Group or made up to a date which is not more than three months before the Groups reporting date.
The share of any losses is restricted to a level that reflects an obligation to fund such losses.
B GOODWILL Goodwill arises on business combinations, including the acquisition of subsidiaries, and on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates: goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the Groups investment in joint ventures and associates.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal except where it has been written off directly to reserves in the past.
C OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets include brands, core deposit intangible, purchased credit card relationships, customerrelated intangibles and both internally and externally generated capitalised software enhancements.
Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Capitalised software enhancements up to 7 years Brands which have been assessed as having finite lives 1015 years Customerrelated intangibles up to 10 years Core deposit intangible up to 8 years Purchased credit card relationships 5 years Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D REVENUE RECOGNITION Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interestbearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The effective interest rate is calculated on initial recognition of the financial asset or liability by estimating the future cash flows after considering all the contractual terms of the instrument but not future credit losses.
The calculation includes all amounts expected to be paid or received by the Group BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 189 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED including expected early redemption fees and related penalties and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account in the calculation.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss see H below.
Fees and commissions which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are generally recognised when the service has been provided.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan once drawn.
Where it is unlikely that loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised over the life of the facility.
Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and the Group retains no part of the loan package for itself or retains a part at the same effective interest rate for all interestbearing financial instruments, including loans and advances, as for the other participants.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see O below : those relating to leases are set out in K 2 below.
E FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, availableforsale financial assets, heldtomaturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished ie when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expire.
1 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value see F below.
Trading securities are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for shortterm gains.
Such securities are classified as trading securities and recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such by management upon initial recognition.
Such assets and liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss on acquisition in the following circumstances: it eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets and liabilities or recognising gains or losses on different bases.
The main type of financial assets designated by the Group at fair value through profit or loss are assets backing insurance contracts and investment contracts issued by the Groups life insurance businesses.
Fair value designation allows changes in the fair value of these assets to be recorded in the income statement along with the changes in the value of the associated liabilities, thereby significantly reducing the measurement inconsistency had the assets been classified as availableforsale financial assets.
the assets and liabilities are part of a group which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, with management information also prepared on this basis.
As noted in A 2 above certain of the Groups investments are managed as venture capital investments and evaluated on the basis of their fair value and these assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
where the assets and liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Fair value of financial instruments and note 51 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
The Group is permitted to reclassify, at fair value at the date of transfer, nonderivative financial assets other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss by the entity upon initial recognition out of the trading category if they are no longer held for the purpose of being sold or repurchased in the near term, as follows: 190 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED if the financial assets would have met the definition of loans and receivables but for the fact that they had to be classified as held for trading at initial recognition, they may be reclassified into loans and receivables where the Group has the intention and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity: or if the financial assets would not have met the definition of loans and receivables, they may be reclassified out of the held for trading category into availableforsale financial assets in rare circumstances.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, heldtomaturity investments or as loans and receivables are classified as availableforsale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Availableforsale financial assets are those intended to be held for an indeterminate period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as availableforsale are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group is permitted to transfer a financial asset from the availableforsale category to the loans and receivables category where that asset would have met the definition of loans and receivables at the time of reclassification if the financial asset had not been designated as availableforsale and where there is both the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future.
Reclassification of a financial asset from the availableforsale category to the heldtomaturity category is permitted when the Group has the ability and intent to hold that financial asset to maturity.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the loans and receivables and heldtomaturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.
Any previous gain or loss on a transferred asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest method or until the asset becomes impaired.
Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interest method.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of availableforsale assets transferred, the unamortised balance of any availableforsale reserve that remains in equity is transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairment loss.
3 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and eligible assets including those transferred into this category out of the fair value through profit or loss or availableforsale financial assets categories.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers at fair value inclusive of transaction costs or, for eligible assets transferred into this category, their fair value at the date of transfer.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method see D above less provision for impairment see H below.
The Group has entered into securitisation and similar transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers.
In cases where the securitisation vehicles are funded by the issue of debt, on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio of securitised lending are retained by the Group, these loans and advances continue to be recognised by the Group, together with a corresponding liability for the funding.
4 Held-to-maturity investments Heldtomaturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than: those that the Group designates upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss: those that the Group designates as availableforsale: and those that meet the definition of loans and receivables.
These are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
A sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of heldtomaturity investments would result in the reclassification of all heldtomaturity investments to availableforsale financial assets.
5 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 191 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the original carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in the profit or loss.
6 Sale and repurchase agreements including securities lending and borrowing Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and receivables or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured: collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet.
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and receivable or customer deposit.
F DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions, and using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Derivatives are carried in the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that is not part of a hedging relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item and the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedges : 2 hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to recognised assets or liabilities cash flow hedges : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
These are accounted for as follows: 1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as an availableforsale financial asset.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include nonderivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.
192 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED G OFFSET Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of setoff and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.
H IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 1 Assets accounted for at amortised cost At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the financial asset and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
If the asset has a variable rate of interest, the discount rate used for measuring the impairment allowance is the current effective interest rate.
Subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss on a financial asset or a group of financial assets, interest income continues to be recognised on an effective interest rate basis, on the assets carrying value net of impairment provisions.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, such as an improvement in the borrowers credit rating, the allowance is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment allowances are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant.
Such individual assessment is used primarily for the Groups commercial lending portfolios.
Impairment allowances for portfolios of smaller balance homogenous loans such as most residential mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances in the Groups retail portfolios in both the Retail and Consumer Finance divisions that are below the individual assessment thresholds, and for loan losses that have been incurred but not separately identified at the balance sheet date, are determined on a collective basis.
Individual assessment In respect of individually significant financial assets in the Groups commercial lending portfolios, assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed on a watchlist where greater monitoring is undertaken and any adverse or potentially adverse impact on ability to repay is used in assessing whether an asset should be transferred to a dedicated Business Support Unit.
Specific examples of trigger events that would lead to the initial recognition of impairment allowances against lending to corporate borrowers or the recognition of additional impairment allowances include i trading losses, loss of business or major customer of a borrower: ii material breaches of the terms and conditions of a loan facility, including nonpayment of interest or principal, or a fall in the value of security such that it is no longer considered adequate: iii disappearance of an active market because of financial difficulties: or iv restructuring a facility with preferential terms to aid recovery of the lending such as a debt for equity swap.
For such individually identified financial assets, a review is undertaken of the expected future cash flows which requires significant management judgement as to the amount and timing of such cash flows.
Where the debt is secured, the assessment reflects the expected cash flows from the realisation of the security, net of costs to realise, whether or not foreclosure or realisation of the collateral is probable.
For impaired debt instruments which are held at amortised cost, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows.
A reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
Collective assessment Impairment is assessed on a collective basis for 1 homogenous groups of loans that are not considered individually impaired: and 2 to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to individual impairment.
Homogenous groups of loans In respect of portfolios of smaller balance, homogenous loans, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
Segmentation takes into account factors such as the type of asset, industry sector, geographical location, collateral type, pastdue status and other relevant factors.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Generally, the impairment trigger used within the impairment calculation for a loan, or group of loans, is when they reach a predefined level of delinquency or where the customer is bankrupt.
Loans where the Group provides arrangements that forgive a portion of interest or principal are also deemed to be impaired and loans that are originated to refinance currently impaired assets are also defined as impaired.
In respect of the Groups secured mortgage portfolios, the impairment allowance is calculated based on a definition of impaired loans which are those six months or more in arrears or certain cases where the borrower is bankrupt or is in possession.
The estimated cash flows are calculated based on historical experience and are dependent on estimates of the expected value of collateral which takes into account expected future movements in house prices, less costs to sell.
For unsecured personal lending portfolios, the impairment trigger is generally when the balance is two or more instalments in arrears or where the customer has exhibited one or more of the impairment characteristics set out above.
While the trigger is based on the payment performance or circumstances of each individual asset, the assessment of future cash flows uses historical experience of cohorts of similar portfolios such that the BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 193 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED assessment is considered to be collective.
Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the cohort and historical loss experience for similar assets.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data about economic and credit conditions including unemployment rates and borrowers behaviour to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Incurred but not yet identified impairment The collective provision also includes provision for inherent losses, that is losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
The loans that are not currently recognised as impaired are grouped into homogenous portfolios by key risk drivers.
Risk drivers for secured retail lending include the current indexed loantovalue, previous mortgage arrears, internal crossproduct delinquency data and external credit bureau data: for unsecured retail lending they include whether the account is uptodate and, if not, the number of payments that have been missed: and for commercial lending they include factors such as observed default rates and loss given default.
An assessment is made of the likelihood of each account becoming recognised as impaired within the loss emergence period, with the economic loss that each portfolio is likely to generate were it to become impaired.
The loss emergence period is determined by local management for each portfolio and the Group has a range of loss emergence periods which are dependent upon the characteristics of the portfolios.
Loss emergence periods are reviewed regularly and updated when appropriate.
In general the periods used across the Group vary between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
Unsecured portfolios tend to have shorter loss emergence periods than secured portfolios.
Loan renegotiations and forbearance In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying value of the asset, the asset continues to be reported as past due and is considered impaired.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will recover the original carrying value of the asset, the loan is no longer reported as past due or impaired provided that payments are made in accordance with the revised terms.
Renegotiation may lead to the loan and associated provision being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.
Write offs A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the writeoff takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that forbearance is no longer appropriate.
For commercial lending, a writeoff occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence for example, third party valuations is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.
Debt for equity exchanges Equity securities acquired in exchange for loans in order to achieve an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the loan and an acquisition of equity securities, held as availableforsale.
Where control is obtained over an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated: where the Group has significant influence over an entity as a result of the transaction, the investment is accounted for by the equity method of accounting see A above.
Any subsequent impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as an impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an impairment of the original instrument.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an availableforsale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer, assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
For impaired debt instruments, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows: a reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as availableforsale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, an amount not greater than the original impairment loss is credited to the income statement: any excess is taken to other comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
194 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED I INVESTMENT PROPERTY Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
The Groups investment property primarily relates to property held for longterm rental yields and capital appreciation within the life insurance funds.
Investment property is carried in the balance sheet at fair value, being the open market value as determined in accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by an independent valuation expert.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be measured at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement as net trading income.
J TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Tangible fixed assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straightline method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Premises excluding land : Freehold long and short leasehold premises: shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease.
Leasehold improvements: shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease.
Equipment: Fixtures and furnishings: 1020 years.
Other equipment and motor vehicles: 28 years.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
K LEASES 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of provisions, within loans and advances to banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straightline basis over the life of the lease.
The Group evaluates nonlease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.
L EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Shortterm employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performancebased cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.
The Group operates a number of postretirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years: these valuations are updated to 31 December each year by qualified independent actuaries.
For the purposes of these annual updates scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 195 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense income, and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest expense income is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income and net of the cost of managing the plan assets, and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if applicable are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
The accounting for sharebased compensation is set out in M below.
M SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of equitysettled, sharebased compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You Earn plans are treated as nonvesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.
N TAXATION Current income tax which is payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
For the Groups longterm insurance businesses, the tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on shareholders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under current UK tax rules.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which those profits arise.
The tax effects of losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred and current tax related to gains and losses on the fair value remeasurement of availableforsale investments and cash flow hedges, where these gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such tax is subsequently transferred to the income statement together with the gain or loss.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
O INSURANCE The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which permits with certain exceptions the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS.
The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UK GAAP, including FRS 27 Life Assurance, and UK established practice.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
196 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets.
Nonparticipating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
1 Life insurance business i Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unitlinked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.
Liabilities Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds Liabilities of the Groups withprofit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Further details on the realistic capital regime are given on page 165.
Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of inforce policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked Liabilities for unitlinked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.
Unallocated surplus Any amounts in the withprofit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
ii Accounting for non-participating investment contracts The Groups nonparticipating investment contracts are primarily unitlinked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unitlinked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the nonparticipating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new nonparticipating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and is reviewed for impairment in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 197 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED iii Value of in-force business The Group recognises as an asset the value of inforce business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both nonmarket risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to nonparticipating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.
2 General insurance business The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products.
Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts and only credited to the income statement when earned.
Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases.
Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
Claims liabilities are not discounted.
3 Liability adequacy test At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of inforce business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.
4 Reinsurance Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for benefits payable on one or more contracts issued by the Group are recognised as assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as insurance contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as nonparticipating investment contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers financial risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as nonparticipating investment contracts.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as insurance contracts Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.
Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income.
Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as nonparticipating investment contracts These contracts are accounted for as financial assets whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the reinsurers investment funds.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
P FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
Nonmonetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on equities and similar nonmonetary items held at fair value 198 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on availableforsale nonmonetary financial assets, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal.
Q PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of vacant leasehold property where the unavoidable costs of the present obligations exceed anticipated rental income.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
Provision is made for irrevocable undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
R SHARE CAPITAL 1 Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
2 Dividends Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
3 Treasury shares Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and nonmandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.
NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows.
ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LOANS AND RECEIVABLES At 31 December 2014 gross loans and receivables totalled 516,612 million 2013: 531,763 million against which impairment allowances of 6,540 million 2013: 12,091 million had been made see note 21.
The Groups accounting policy for losses arising on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described in note 2 H 1 : this note also provides an overview of the methodologies applied.
The allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually and those determined collectively.
Individual impairment allowances are generally established against the Groups commercial lending portfolios.
The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions and the BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 199 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED resulting trading performance of the customer, and the value of the security held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.
In particular, significant judgement is required by management in assessing the borrowers cash flows and debt servicing capability together with the realisable value of collateral.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
Collective impairment allowances are generally established for smaller balance homogenous portfolios such as the retail portfolios.
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is, however, inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
Given the relative size of the mortgage portfolio, a key variable is house prices which determine the collateral value supporting loans in such portfolios.
The value of this collateral is estimated by applying changes in house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
If average house prices were ten per cent lower than those estimated at 31 December 2014, the impairment charge would increase by approximately 195 million in respect of UK mortgages and a further 6 million in respect of Irish mortgages.
In addition, a collective unimpaired provision is made for loan losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is specifically identified.
This period is known as the loss emergence period.
In the Commercial Banking division, an increase of one month in the loss emergence period in respect of the loan portfolio assessed for collective unimpaired provisions would result in an increase in the collective unimpaired provision of approximately 53million at 31 December 2013, a one month increase in the loss emergence period would have increased the collective unimpaired provision by an estimated 105 million.
RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS At 31 December 2014 the Group carried deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of 4,145 million 2013: 5,104 million and deferred tax liabilities of 54million 2013: 3 million note 39.
This presentation takes into account the ability of the Group to net deferred tax assets and liabilities only where there is a legally enforceable right of offset.
Note 39 presents the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities by type.
The largest category of deferred tax asset relates to tax losses carried forward.
The recoverability of the Groups deferred tax assets in respect of carry forward losses is based on an assessment of future levels of taxable profit expected to arise that can be offset against these losses.
The Groups expectations as to the level of future taxable profits take into account the Groups longterm financial and strategic plans, and anticipated future tax adjusting items.
In making this assessment account is taken of business plans, the five year board approved operating plan and the following future risk factors: The expected future economic outlook as set out in the Group Chief Executives Review and Market Overview: The retail banking business disposal as required by the European Commission: and Future regulatory change.
The Groups total deferred tax asset includes 5,758 million 2013: 6,338 million in respect of trading losses carried forward.
The tax losses have arisen in individual legal entities and will be used as future taxable profits arise in those legal entities, though substantially all of the unused tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has been recognised arise in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc.
The deferred tax asset is expected to be utilised over different time periods in each of the entities in which the losses arise.
Under current UK tax law there is no expiry date for unused tax losses.
The losses are still expected to be fully utilised by 2019.
In December 2014 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced proposals to restrict to 50 per cent the amount of banks profits that can be offset by carried forward tax losses for the purposes of calculating corporation tax liabilities.
These proposals are expected to be included in the Finance Bill 2015 and, if passed into law, will take effect in respect of profits arising after 1 April 2015.
The Group estimates that these proposals will result in no change to the level of deferred tax recognition although it will increase the period over which it expects to fully utilise its tax losses from 2019 to 2025.
As disclosed in note 39, deferred tax assets totalling 921 million 2013: 802 million have not been recognised in respect of certain capital losses carried forward, trading losses carried forward and unrelieved foreign tax credits as there are no predicted future capital or taxable profits against which these losses can be recognised.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2014 in respect of the Groups retirement benefit obligations was 694 million comprising an asset of 1,147million and a liability of 453 million 2013: a net liability of 998 million comprising an asset of 98 million and a liability of 1,096 million related to postretirement defined benefit schemes.
The defined benefit pension schemes net accounting surplus totalled 890 million 2013: deficit of 787 million representing the difference between the schemes liabilities and the fair value of the related assets at the balance sheet date.
The value of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The accounting surplus or deficit is sensitive to changes in the discount rate, which is affected by market conditions and therefore potentially subject to significant variation.
The cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the longevity of the members.
Assumptions are made regarding the expected lifetime of scheme members based upon recent experience and extrapolate the improving trend, however given the rate of advance in medical science and increasing levels of obesity, it is uncertain whether they will ultimately reflect actual experience.
200 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED The effect on the net accounting surplus or deficit and on the pension charge in the Groups income statement of changes to the principal actuarial assumptions is set out in note 38.
VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS At 31 December 2014, the Group recognised a value of inforce business asset of 4,446million 2013: 4,874 million and an acquired value of inforce business asset of 418million 2013: 461 million.
The value of inforce business asset represents the present value of future profits expected to arise from the portfolio of inforce life insurance and participating investment contracts.
The acquired value of inforce business asset represents the contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to nonparticipating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers.
The methodology used to value these assets is set out in note 25.
The valuation or recoverability of these assets requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to these assets.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of inforce business assets at 31 December 2014 are set out in note 25.
At 31 December 2014, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of 86,918million 2013: 82,777 million.
The methodology used to value these liabilities is described in note 33.
Elements of the liability valuations require assumptions to be made about future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour and are subject to significant management judgement and estimation uncertainty.
The key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of these liabilities are set out in note 33.
The effect on the Groups profit before tax and shareholders equity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 34.
PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE AND OTHER REGULATORY PROVISIONS At 31 December 2014, the Group carried provisions of 3,378 million 2013: 3,815 million against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches, principally the misselling of payment protection insurance.
Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent managements best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement.
It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld and the average cost of redress.
Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.
Note 40 contains more detail on the nature of the assumptions that have been made and key sensitivities.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, the Group categorises financial instruments carried on the balance sheet at fair value using a three level hierarchy.
Financial instruments categorised as level 1 are valued using quoted market prices and therefore there is minimal judgement applied in determining fair value.
However, the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 2 and, in particular, level 3 is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and valuation models.
These valuation techniques involve management judgement and estimates the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information.
Valuation techniques for level 2 financial instruments use inputs that are based on observable market data.
Level 3 financial instruments are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Determining the appropriate assumptions to be used for level 3 financial instruments requires significant management judgement.
At 31 December 2014, the Group classified 8,145 million of financial assets, including 2,771million of derivatives, and 1,512 million of financial liabilities, including 1,456million of derivatives, as level 3.
Further details of the Groups level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their valuation including the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are set out in note 51.
Details about sensitivities to market risk arising from trading assets and other treasury positions can be found in the Risk Management section on page 138.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 201 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Lloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locations overseas.
The Group Executive Committee has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The Group Executive Committee reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
GEC considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided, by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The effects of asset sales, volatile items, liability management, simplification costs, TSB build and dual running costs, regulatory provisions, certain past service pension credits or charges, the amortisation of purchased intangible assets and the unwind of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments are excluded in arriving at underlying profit.
Following a reorganisation effective from 1 January 2014, the Groups activities are now organised into five financial reporting segments: Retail: Commercial Banking: Consumer Finance: Insurance and TSB.
The most significant changes to the segmental structure are: The Wealth business has been integrated into the Retail division: The Consumer Finance division now includes credit cards, asset finance and the European online deposits businesses: the Retail and Commercial Banking credit cards businesses have transferred into Consumer Finance: TSB operates as a standalone listed entity following the IPO: The remaining portfolio of assets which are outside of the Groups risk appetite is managed within Other.
In addition certain regulatory costs, such as UK bank levy and charges in relation to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which were previously reported in Central items, are now attributed to the operating divisions.
Comparative figures have been restated for all of these changes.
The Groups underlying profit and statutory results are unchanged as a result of these restatements.
Retail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings, personal loans and mortgages, to UK retail customers, incorporating wealth and small business customers.
It is also a distributor of insurance, protection and credit cards and a range of longterm savings and investment products.
Commercial Banking is client led, focusing on SME, Mid Markets, Global Corporates and Financial Institution clients providing products across Lending, Global Transaction Banking, Financial Markets and Debt Capital Markets and private equity financing through Lloyds Development Capital.
Consumer Finance comprises the Groups consumer and corporate Credit Card businesses, along with the Black Horse motor financing and Lex Autolease car leasing businesses in Asset Finance.
The Groups European deposits and Dutch retail mortgage businesses are managed within Asset Finance.
Insurance is a core part of Lloyds Banking Group and is focused on four key markets: Corporate Pensions, Protection, Retirement and Home Insurance, to enable customers to protect themselves today and prepare for a secure financial future.
TSB is a separately listed multichannel retail banking business with branches in England, Wales and Scotland: it has a digital distribution platform and four telephony contact centres.
It serves retail and small business customers: providing a full range of retail banking products.
Other includes certain assets previously reported as outside of the Groups risk appetite and the results and gains on sale relating to businesses disposed in 2013 and 2014.
Other also includes income and expenditure not recharged to divisions, including the costs of certain central and head office functions and the costs of managing the Groups technology platforms, branch and head office property estate, operations including payments, banking operations and collections and sourcing, the costs of which are predominantly recharged to the other divisions.
It also reflects other items not recharged to the divisions.
Intersegment services are generally recharged at cost, with the exception of the internal commission arrangements between the UK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group, where a profit margin is also charged.
Intersegment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that noninterest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
202 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS CONTINUED For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.
This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.

In addition the Group completed a tender offer to eligible retail holders outside the United States to sell their Sterlingdenominated ECNs for cash.
The exchange offers completed with the equivalent of 5.0 billion of ECNs being exchanged for the equivalent of 5.35 billion of AT1 securities, before issue costs.
The retail tender offer completed with approximately 58.5 million of ECNs being repurchased for cash.
A loss of 1,362 million has been recognised in relation to these exchange and tender transactions in the year ended 31 December 2014.
Losses of 24 million arose in the year ended 31 December 2014 2013: losses of 142 million: 2012: losses of 338 million on other transactions undertaken as part of the Groups management of its wholesale funding and subordinated debt.
OTHER On 31 March 2014 the Group completed the sale of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, realising a gain of 128 million: this gain has been more than offset by losses on other asset sales.
During 2013 the Group had completed a number of disposals of assets and businesses, including the sale of its shareholding in St Jamess Place plc profit of 540 million, a portfolio of US residential mortgagebacked securities profit of 538 million, its Spanish retail banking operations loss of 256 million, its Australian operations profit of 49 million and its German life insurance business this disposal completed in the first quarter of 2014, but an impairment of 382 million was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2013.

The effect of this change was to reduce the Groups retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet by 843 million with a corresponding curtailment gain recognised in the income statement.
This has been partly offset by a charge of 21 million following changes to pension arrangements for staff within the TSB business.
In 2013, the Group agreed certain changes to early retirement and commutation factors in two of its principal defined benefit pension schemes, resulting in a curtailment cost of 104 million recognised in the Groups income statement in the year ended 31 December 2013.
During 2012, following a review of policy in respect of discretionary pension increases in relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, increases in certain schemes are now linked to the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Price Index.
The impact of this change was a reduction in the Groups defined benefit obligation of 258 million, recognised in the Groups income statement in 2012, net of a charge of 8 million resulting from a change to the commutation factors in one of the Groups smaller schemes.
2 Regulatory provisions of 50 million were charged against income in 2012.

Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to the costs associated with the SarbanesOxley Act audit requirements together with the cost of the audit of the Groups Form 20F filing.
Audit related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of prospectuses and circulars required by the UKLA listing rules.
Services relating to taxation: This category includes tax compliance and tax advisory services.
Other non-audit fees: This category includes due diligence relating to corporate finance, including venture capital transactions and other assurance and advisory services.
It is the Groups policy to use the auditors on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.
Such assignments typically relate to the provision of advice on tax issues, assistance in transactions involving the acquisition and disposal of businesses and accounting advice.
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including that fees for audit and nonaudit services are approved in advance.
This approval can be obtained either on an individual engagement basis or, for certain types of nonaudit services, particularly those of a recurring nature, through the approval of a fee cap covering engagements of that type provided the fee is below that cap.
All statutory audit work as well as nonaudit assignments where the fee is expected to exceed the relevant fee cap must be preapproved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis.
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives a report detailing all preapproved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such preapproved services.
The audit committee reviews on an ongoing basis the total level of nonaudit fees paid to PwC against various regulatory and other thresholds.
The regulation, which was issued by the European Parliament in April 2014, specifies a cap of 70 per cent for nonaudit fees as a percentage of total audit fees for the last three years, although the precise requirement remains subject to the national implementation process.
Whilst noting that uncertainties remain regarding the detailed application of the requirement and that it is a three year measure, the Group estimates that the level of nonaudit fees versus audit fees stood at 72 per cent for the year to 31 December 2014.
During the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following: 2014 2013 2012 m m m Audits of Group pension schemes 0.3 0.3 0.4 Audits of the unconsolidated Open Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group 0.4 0.5 0.8 Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers 5.0 6.5 5.4 Acquisition due diligence and other work performed in respect of potential venture capital investments 1.0 2.1 0.7 NOTE 12: IMPAIRMENT 2014 2013 2012 m m m Impairment losses on loans and receivables: Loans and advances to customers 735 2,725 5,125 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 2 1 4 Total impairment losses on loans and receivables note 21 737 2,726 5,121 Impairment of availableforsale financial assets 5 15 37 Other credit risk provisions 10 9 Total impairment charged to the income statement 752 2,741 5,149 214 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 13: TAXATION A ANALYSIS OF TAX CHARGE CREDIT FOR THE YEAR 2014 2013 2012 m m m UK corporation tax: Current tax on profit for the year 162 226 181 Adjustments in respect of prior years 213 205 58 51 431 123 Foreign tax: Current tax on profit for the year 39 60 86 Adjustments in respect of prior years 3 26 8 36 34 94 Current tax credit charge 15 465 217 Deferred tax note 39 : Origination and reversal of temporary differences 72 434 329 Due to change in UK corporation tax rate 24 594 320 Adjustments in respect of prior years 182 276 85 278 752 564 Tax charge 263 1,217 781 The charge for tax on the profit for 2014 is based on a UK corporation tax rate of 21.5 per cent 2013: 23.25 per cent: 2012: 24.5 per cent.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees.
The number of shares that could have been acquired at the average annual share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.
This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.
The weightedaverage number of antidilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 7million at 31 December 2014 2013: 28million: 2012: 37 million.

Included within these assets are investments in unconsolidated structured entities of 27,590 million 2013: 24,552 million, see note 20: ii loans and advances to customers of 27 million at 31 December 2013 which were economically hedged by interest rate derivatives which were not in hedge accounting relationships and where significant measurement inconsistencies would otherwise have arisen if the related derivatives had not been treated as trading liabilities and the loans and advances had not been carried at amortised cost: and iii private equity investments of 2,350 million 2013: 2,632 million that are managed, and evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy and reported to key management personnel on that basis.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2013 of the loans and advances to banks and customers designated at fair value through profit or loss at that date was 27 million: the Group did not hold any credit derivatives or other instruments in mitigation of this risk.
There was no significant movement in the fair value of these loans attributable to changes in credit risk which was determined by reference to the publicly available credit ratings of the instruments involved.
For amounts included above which are subject to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements see note 54.
NOTE 16: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies: Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers: To manage and hedge the Groups interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business.
The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 54: and Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds.
Derivatives are classified as trading except those designated as effective hedging instruments which meet the criteria under IAS 39.
Derivatives are held at fair value on the Groups balance sheet.
A description of the methodology used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions for those derivatives valued using unobservable inputs is set out in note 51.
The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows: Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future.
An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options.
A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies: the exchange of principal can be notional or actual.
A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at preset intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.
The Group also uses credit default swaps to securitise, in combination with external funding, 611million 2013: 828 million of corporate and commercial banking loans.
Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equitybased retail product activity to eliminate the Groups exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices.
Indexlinked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.

222 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 19: SECURITISATIONS AND COVERED BONDS SECURITISATION PROGRAMMES Loans and advances to customers and debt securities classified as loans and receivables include loans securitised under the Groups securitisation programmes, the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities.
As the structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Groups balance sheet, with the related notes in issue included within debt securities in issue.
COVERED BOND PROGRAMMES Certain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of covered bonds by the Group.
The Group retains all of the risks and rewards associated with these loans and the partnerships are consolidated fully with the loans retained on the Groups balance sheet and the related covered bonds in issue included within debt securities in issue.
The Groups principal securitisation and covered bond programmes, together with the balances of the advances subject to these arrangements and the carrying value of the notes in issue at 31 December, are listed below.
The notes in issue are reported in note 32.

Cash deposits of 11,251 million 2013: 13,500 million held by the Group are restricted in use to repayment of the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term advances relating to covered bonds and other legal obligations.
Additionally, the Group had certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities.
At 31 December 2014 these obligations had not been triggered: the maximum exposure under these facilities was 392 million 2013: 402 million.
The Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which Limited Liability Partnerships have been established to ringfence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group.
At the reporting date the Group had overcollateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility.
From timetotime, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes.
The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.
The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets.
The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes.
Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired.
The Group has not voluntarily offered to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2014 2013: none.
Such repurchases are made in order to ensure that the expected maturity dates of the notes issued from these programmes are met.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 223 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 20: STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Groups interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated.
Detail of the Groups interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in: note 19 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 38 for structured entities associated with the Groups pension schemes, and below in part A and B.
Details of the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part C. A ASSET-BACKED CONDUITS In addition to the structured entities discussed in note 19, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active assetbacked conduit, Cancara, which invests in debt securities and client receivables.
The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2014 was 5,245 million 2013: 5,081 million, comprising 4,605 million of loans and advances 2013: 4,781 million and 640 million of assetbacked securities 2013: 300 million.
All debt securities and lending assets held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Groups banking activities.
The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.
As at 31 December 2014 and 2013 these obligations had not been triggered.
In addition, the Group sponsors two further assetbacked conduits, which are being run down.
These assetbacked conduits have no commercial paper in issue and no external liquidity providers.
The external assets in all of the Groups conduits are consolidated in the Groups financial statements.
B CONSOLIDATED COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT VEHICLES The assets and liabilities of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as OpenEnded Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group.
However, the Groups investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable.
As at 31 December 2014, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was 66,070 million 2013: 55,934 million.
The Group has no contractual arrangements such as liquidity facilities that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles: the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.
C UNCONSOLIDATED COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT VEHICLES AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS The Groups direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as OpenEnded Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of 27,255 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 24,552 million, included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss see note 15.
These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group.
At 31 December 2014, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was 620 billion 2013: 543 billion.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment.
However, the Groups investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Groups investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities.
The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in the vehicles.
During the year the Group has not provided any noncontractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support.
There were no transfers from to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.
The Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity: and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity: market products associated with the structured entity in its own name and or provide guarantees regarding the structured entitys performance.
The Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision maker and markets the funds under one of the Groups brands.
The Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds.
The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2014, are reported in note 49.

The investment properties are valued at least annually at openmarket value, by independent professionally qualified valuers, who have recent experience in the location and categories of the investment properties being valued.
The fair value of investment properties is measured using the market approach and incorporates the income approach where appropriate.
The fair value of investment property is generally measured using observable inputs.
Whether investment properties are categorised as level 2 or 3 see note 51 4 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy depends on the extent of the adjustments made to observable inputs and this depends on the investment property concerned.
Investment property is compared to property for which there is observable market data about its realisable value on disposal.
Adjustments to this observable data are applied, if necessary, for specific characteristics of the property, such as the nature, location or condition of the specific asset.
If such information is not available, alternative valuation methods using unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow analysis or recent prices in less active markets are used.
For investment property under construction, the value on disposal is considered to be at the point at which the property is fully constructed.
Adjustments are made for the costs and risks associated with construction.
Investment property under construction for which fair value is not yet reliably measurable is valued at cost, until the fair value can be reliably measured.
The table above analyses movements in investment properties, all of which are categorised as level 3.

The goodwill held in the Groups balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit: of the total balance of 2,016 million 2013: 2,016 million, 1,836 million, or 91 per cent of the total 2013: 1,836 million, 91 per cent of the total has been allocated to Scottish Widows in the Groups Insurance division and 170 million, or 8 per cent of the total 2013: 170 million, 8 per cent of the total to Asset Finance in the Groups Consumer Finance division.
226 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 24: GOODWILL CONTINUED The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows has been based on a valueinuse calculation.
The calculation uses pretax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a fiveyear period, and a discount rate of 10 per cent.
The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.
The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information.
Cash flows beyond the fiveyear period have been extrapolated using a steady 3 per cent growth rate which does not exceed the longterm average growth rate for the life assurance market.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Asset Finance has also been based on a valueinuse calculation using pretax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a fiveyear period and a discount rate of 14 per cent.
The cash flows beyond the fiveyear period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5 per cent which does not exceed the longterm average growth rates for the markets in which Asset Finance participates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Asset Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.

This will also contain changes in the other assets and liabilities, including the effects of changes in assumptions used to value the liabilities, of the relevant businesses.

BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 227 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 25: VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS CONTINUED The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of inforce business are set out below: ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a riskfree rate and all cash flows are discounted at a riskfree rate.
The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business where an illiquidity premium is included, see below.
A marketconsistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found on page 164.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets.
The value of the inforce business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets.
The determination of the market premium for illiquidity reflects actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data, and has been checked for consistency with the capital markets.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 120basis points at 31 December 2014 2013: 91 basis points.
The riskfree rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.
The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December: 2014 2013 % % 1 Riskfree rate value of inforce nonannuity business 0.00 to 3.27 0.00 to 4.04 1 Riskfree rate value of inforce annuity business 1.02 to 4.56 0.64 to 5.06 1 Riskfree rate financial options and guarantees 0.29 to 2.20 0.21 to 3.45 Retail price inflation 3.26 3.59 Expense inflation 3.92 4.25 1 All riskfree rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant swap curve.
NON-MARKET RISK An allowance for nonmarket risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for nonmarket risk is required.
However, in the case of operational risk, reinsurer default and the withprofit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
NON-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Future mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paidup rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse persistency and paid-up rates Lapse and paid up rates assumptions are reviewed each year.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience.
In determining this best estimate view, a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration and any known or expected trends in underlying data.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs.
Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
These assumptions are intended to represent a best estimate of future experience, and further information about the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 34.

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the withprofit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against shortterm market fluctuations.
Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met.
Withprofit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities Withprofit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are: Withprofit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for withprofit policies: Cost of options and guarantees including guaranteed annuity options : Deductions levied against asset shares: Planned enhancements to withprofits benefits reserve: and Impact of the smoothing policy.
The realistic assessment is carried out using a stochastic simulation model which values liabilities on a marketconsistent basis.
The calculation of realistic liabilities uses best estimate assumptions for mortality, persistency rates and expenses.
These are calculated in a similar manner to those used for the value of inforce business as discussed in note 25.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 233 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 33: LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS CONTINUED iii Assumptions Key assumptions used in the calculation of withprofit liabilities, and the processes for determining these, are: Investment returns and discount rates The realistic capital regime dictates that withprofit fund liabilities are valued on a marketconsistent basis.
This is achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data.
The withprofit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the riskfree yield and all cash flows are discounted using the riskfree yield.
The riskfree yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk.
Further information on significant options and guarantees is given on page 164.
Guaranteed annuity option takeup rates Certain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
Investment volatility The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
Non-profit fund liabilities i Business description The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its nonprofit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unitlinked pensions and unitlinked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and longterm creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities The nonprofit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and consistent with the approach required by regulatory rules.
The methods used involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the inforce book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
iii Assumptions Generally, assumptions used to value nonprofit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation.
This margin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
The key assumptions used in the measurement of nonprofit fund liabilities are: Interest rates The rates used are derived in accordance with the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies.
These limit the rates of interest that can be used by reference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
234 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 33: LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS CONTINUED Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates are allowed for on some nonprofit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for withprofit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the nonprofit fund liabilities.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2014 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 119 million decrease.
Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality rates 23 million increase.
Change in expenses assumptions 51 million increase.
Change in credit default methodology 36 million increase.
These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the inforce business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.

Assumptions are intended to be neutral estimates of the most likely or expected outcome.
There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.
The reserving methodology and associated assumptions are set out below: The unearned premium reserve is determined on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of each contract.
Claims outstanding comprise those claims that have been notified and those that have been incurred but not reported.
Claims incurred but not reported are determined based on the historical emergence of claims and their average cost.
The notified claims element represents the best estimate of the cost of claims reported using projections and estimates based on historical experience.

2 This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate.
3 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing lapse and surrender rates to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
4 This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.
5 This sensitivity shows the impact on the value of inforce business, financial options and guarantee costs, statutory reserves and asset values of reducing the riskfree rate by 25 basis points.
6 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 5 per cent addition to the expected rate.
7 This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 1 per cent addition to the expected rate.
8 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Swap curves, the riskfree rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premia.
It assumes the overall spreads on assets are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Swap curves and the nonannuity riskfree rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity riskfree rate.

In 2013, the Group agreed certain changes to early retirement and commutation factors in two of its principal defined benefit pension schemes, resulting in a cost of 104 million recognised in the Groups income statement in the year ended 31 December 2013.
In 2012, there was a net credit of 250 million following a decision to link discretionary pension increases in certain schemes to the Consumer Price Index.

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the defined benefit sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Schemes Nos 1 and 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme.
These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2014 is generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at 50.
The Group operates a number of funded and unfunded pension arrangements, the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK.
All schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law by the trustees.
All UK schemes are funded in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation exercise is carried out for each scheme at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities Technical Provisions are measured using prudent assumptions, if a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The outcome of this valuation process, including agreement of any recovery plans, is agreed between the Group and the scheme Trustee.
The Groups overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.
The latest full valuations of the three main schemes were carried out as at 30 June 2011: the results have been updated to 31 December 2014 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 December 2014 by qualified independent actuaries.
240 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 38: RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED During 2009, the Group made oneoff contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 2 of approximately 1 billion in aggregate.
These contributions took the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which contained assets of approximately 5.4 billion in aggregate entitling the schemes to annual payments of approximately 215 million in aggregate until 31 December 2014.
As all scheduled distributions have now been made, the value of the partnership interests equates to a nominal amount and the limited liability partnerships will continue to hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 2.
At 31 December 2014, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximately 5.1 billion and cash payments of 215 million were made to the pension schemes during the year 2013: 215 million.
The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet see note 20.
The Group has also established two private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme and a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 1.
At 31 December 2014 these held assets of approximately 2.8 billion in aggregate: they do not make any distributions to the pension schemes.
The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes.
The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2014.
The Group currently expects to pay contributions of approximately 425 million to its defined benefit schemes in 2015.
The responsibility for the governance of the Groups funded defined benefit pension schemes lies with the Pension Trustees.
Each of the Groups funded UK defined benefit pension schemes are managed by a Trustee Board the Trustee whose role is to ensure that their Scheme is administered in accordance with the Scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries.
The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemes regulations.

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2014 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.5 years for a male and 29.8 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. iii Amount timing and uncertainty of future cash flows Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes Whilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below: Inflation rate risk: the majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be partially offset by holdings of inflationlinked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AArated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings.
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other returnseeking assets.
If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit.
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Groups income statement.
244 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 38: RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.
Sensitivity analysis The effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Groups income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme liability, for the Groups three most significant schemes, is set out below.
The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility.
The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result.
It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice.
Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.
Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions Increase decrease Increase decrease in the in the income net defined benefit pension statement charge scheme liability 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m 1 Inflation including pension increases : Increase of 0.1 per cent 18 24 383 414 Decrease of 0.1 per cent 16 6 362 122 2 Discount rate: Increase of 0.1 per cent 30 30 611 542 Decrease of 0.1 per cent 29 33 623 550 Expected life expectancy of members: Increase of one year 34 38 750 686 Decrease of one year 32 36 738 676 1 At 31 December 2014, the assumed rate of RPI inflation is 2.95 per cent and CPI inflation 1.95 per cent 2013: RPI 3.3 per cent and CPI 2.3 per cent.
2 At 31 December 2014, the assumed discount rate is 3.67 per cent 2013: 4.60 per cent.
Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the Groups three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Groups pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.
The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI and the Retail Prices Index RPI, and include the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.
These pension increases are linked to inflation either CPI or RPI subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.
The sensitivity analysis including the inflation sensitivity does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.
The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme.
Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.
Assetliability matching strategies The main schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities.
The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Specific assetliability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.
A significant goal of the assetliability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation.
In the main, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements.
These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities, and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.
The assetliability matching strategy currently mitigates approximately 89 per cent 2013: 54 per cent of the interest rate volatility and 94 per cent 2013: 71 per cent of the inflation rate volatility of the liabilities.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 245 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 38: RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation The following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligations and the distribution and timing of benefit payments: 2014 2013 Years Years Duration of the defined benefit obligation 19 19 2014 2013 m m Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid Benefits expected to be paid within 12 months 1,179 1,067 Benefits expected to be paid between 1 and 2 years 1,059 1,009 Benefits expected to be paid between 2 and 5 years 3,538 3,420 Benefits expected to be paid between 5 and 10 years 7,334 7,207 Benefits expected to be paid between 10 and 15 years 8,831 8,945 Benefits expected to be paid between 15 and 25 years 20,011 21,102 Benefits expected to be paid between 25 and 35 years 18,995 20,851 Benefits expected to be paid between 35 and 45 years 14,434 16,374 Benefits expected to be paid in more than 45 years 9,617 11,403 Maturity analysis method and assumptions The projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for expected future inflation.
They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective yearend date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 252 million 2013: 255 million: 2012: 229 million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of schemes which provide postretirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of postretirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1 January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.
For the principal postretirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2014 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.55per cent 2013: 6.90 per cent.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Group companies have recognised deferred tax assets of 5,758million 2013: 6,338 million in relation to trading tax losses carried forward.
After reviews of mediumterm profit forecasts, the Group considers that there will be sufficient profits in the future against which these losses will be offset see note 3.
Deferred tax assets of 190 million 2013: 168 million have not been recognised in respect of capital losses carried forward as there are no predicted future capital profits.
Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 614 million 2013: 593 million have not been recognised in respect of trading losses carried forward, mainly in certain overseas companies and in respect of other temporary differences in the insurance businesses.
Trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely, except for losses in the USA which expire after 20 years.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax carried forward at 31 December 2014 of 117 million 2013: 41 million, as there are no predicted future taxable profits against which the unrelieved foreign tax credits can be utilised.
These tax credits c an be carried forward indefinitely.

PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE Following the unsuccessful legal challenge by the British Bankers Association against the Financial Services Authority FSA now known as the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS, the Group made provisions totalling 9,825 million to 31 December 2013 against the costs of paying redress to customers in respect of past sales of PPI policies, including the related administrative expenses.
During 2014 customer initiated complaints have continued to fall, albeit slower than expected.
The proactive mailings have been substantially completed and remediation of previously defended cases commenced.
A further 2,200 million has been added to the provision in 2014, which brings the total amount provided to 12,025 million, of which approximately 2,520 million relates to anticipated administrative expenses.
As at 31 December 2014, 2,549 million of the provision remained unutilised 21 per cent of total provision relative to an average monthly spend including administration costs in 2014 of approximately of 205 million.
The main drivers of the provision are as follows: Volumes of customer initiated complaints after excluding complaints from customers where no PPI policy was held At 31 December 2013, the provision assumed a total of 3.0 million complaints would be received.
During 2014, complaint volumes were 22 per cent lower than 2013, but continue to be higher than expected.
As a result, the Group is forecasting a slower decline in future volumes than previously expected, largely due to more sustained Claims Management Company CMC activity: nonCMC complaints have declined sharply.
This has resulted in a further provision of approximately 1,080 million.
At 31 December 2014, approximately 3 million complaints have been received, with the provision assuming approximately a further 0.6 million complaints will be received in the future.
However, the provision remains sensitive to future trends.
Proactive mailing resulting from Past Business Reviews PBR The Group is proactively mailing customers where it has been identified that there was a risk of potential missale.
At 31 December 2014 mailing of the original scope has been completed.
During 2014, as a result of ongoing monitoring, some limited additional mailings have been added to the PBR scope.
In addition, PBR responses to mailings have been higher than expected resulting in a further provision for PBR of approximately 300 million added during 2014.
Uphold rates Uphold rates have increased following changes to the complaint handling policy.
The impact to date and going forward resulted in a 110 million increase to the provision.
Average redress Average redress per policy has increased, reversing the trend seen in the first three quarters of 2014.
This higher level is expected to continue going forward and has resulted in an additional provision for the year of 40 million.
Re-review of previously handled cases Approximately 0.6 million cases were included within the scope of remediation at 31 December 2013.
These largely related to previously defended complaints which are being reviewed again to ensure consistency with the current complaint handling policy, now in operation.
This exercise has commenced and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of June 2015, albeit with payments made in the second half of 2015 for some cases.
The Group expects to uphold more of these cases due to the recent increase in uphold rates.
Further cases have also been added to the remediation scope and relate to previously upheld cases.
These cases have previously received redress and may receive a topup payment.
Given the increase in uphold rates and additional volumes to the scope, this has resulted in a further provision for the year of 250 million.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 249 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 40: OTHER PROVISIONS CONTINUED Expenses The Group expects to maintain the PPI operation on its current scale for longer than previously expected given the update to volume related assumptions and the rereview of previously handled cases continuing into 2015.
The estimate for administrative expenses, which comprise litigation and complaint handling costs as well as costs arising from cases subsequently referred to the FOS, has increased by approximately 420 million in 2014.
An Enforcement team of the FCA is investigating the Groups governance of third party suppliers and potential failings in the PPI complaint handling process.
This investigation is ongoing and it is not possible at this stage to make any assessment of what, if any, additional liability may result from the investigation, although the administration costs of supporting the investigation have been provided for previously.
The Group estimates that it has sold approximately 16 million policies since 2000.
These include policies that were not missold as they were suitable for, and appropriately disclosed to, the customer.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 the Group estimates that it has contacted, settled or provided for approximately 45 per cent of the policies sold since 2000, covering both customerinitiated complaints and actual and expected proactive mailings undertaken by the Group.
The total amount provided for PPI represents the Groups best estimate of the likely future costs, albeit a number of risks and uncertainties remain, including complaint volumes, uphold rates, average redress paid, the scope and cost of proactive mailings and remediation, litigation costs and the outcome of the FCA Enforcement investigation.
The cost of these factors could differ materially from the Groups estimates and the assumptions underpinning them and could result in a further provision being required.
Key metrics and sensitivities are highlighted in the table below: 1 Sensitivities To date unless noted Future Sensitivity 2 Customer initiated complaints since origination m 3.0 0.6 0.1 230m 3 Proactive Mailing: number of policies m 2.7 0.1 0.1 45m 4 Proactive Mailing: response rate 34% 30% 1% 3m 5 Average uphold rate per policy 85% 80% 1% 12m 6 Average redress per upheld policy 1,700 1,790 100 90m 7 Remediation Cases m 0.2 1.0 1 case 600 Administrative expenses m 2,035 485 1 case 500 8 FOS Referral Rate 40% 40% 1% 3m 9 FOS Change Rate 58% 30% 1% 2m 1 All sensitivities exclude claims where no PPI policy was held.
2 Sensitivity includes complaint handling costs, and has increased as a result of higher uphold rates and a shift towards older policies.
3 To date volume includes customer initiated complaints.
4 Metric has been adjusted to include mature mailings only.
Future response rates are expected to be lower than experienced to date as mailings to higher risk customers have been prioritised.
The sensitivity has reduced from the half year as the higher risk population continues to decrease.
5 The percentage of complaints where the Group finds in favour of the customer.
This is a blend of proactive and customer initiated complaints.
The 85 per cent uphold rate is based on six months to December 2014.
The lower uphold rate in the future reflects a lower proportion of PBR related cases which typically have a higher uphold rate, reflecting the higher risk nature of those policy sales.
6 The amount that is paid in redress in relation to a policy found to have been missold, comprising, where applicable, the refund of premium, compound interest charged and interest at 8 per cent per annum.
Actuals are based on the six months to December 2014.
The increase in future average redress is influenced by fewer PBR policies due to the maturity of the PBR mailing.
The increase is also due to a shift in the reactive complaint mix towards older, and therefore more expensive, policies.
7 Remediation to date is based on cases reviewed as at 31 December 2014, but not necessarily settled and also includes a small portion relating to previously upheld complaints.
The average cost included in the sensitivity is based on all cases included within the remediation scope, and is therefore a weighted average of full payments, topup payments on previously upheld cases, and nil payouts where the original decision is retained.
8 The percentage of cases reviewed by the Group that are subsequently referred to the FOS by the customer.
A complaint is considered mature when six months have elapsed since initial decision.
Actuals are based on decisions made by the Group during January 2014 to June 2014 and subsequently referred to the FOS.
9 The percentage of complaints referred where the FOS arrive at a different decision to the Group.
The overturn rate to date is high as it continues to include a significant number of cases assessed prior to the implementation of changes to the case review process during 2013.
The provision remains sensitive to future trends: as an example, were reactive complaint levels in the first two quarters of 2015 to remain broadly in line with the fourth quarter of 2014 then the revised modelled total complaints and associated administration costs would increase the provision by approximately 700 million.
OTHER REGULATORY PROVISIONS Litigation in relation to insurance branch business in Germany Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited CMIG has received a number of claims in the German courts relating to policies issued by CMIG but sold by independent intermediaries in Germany, principally during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Following decisions in July 2012 from the Federal Court of Justice in Germany the Group recognised provisions totalling 400 million in 2012 and 2013.
Volumes of claims have not decreased as quickly as expected and as a result the Group has recognised a further 120 million during 2014 bringing the total provision to 520 million.
The remaining unutilised provision as at 31 December 2014 is 199 million.
250 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 40: OTHER PROVISIONS CONTINUED The validity of the claims facing CMIG depends upon the facts and circumstances in respect of each claim.
As a result the ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will only be known once all relevant claims have been resolved.
LIBOR and other trading rates During 2014 the Group charged 225 million to the income statement in respect of this matter.
In July, the Group announced that it had reached settlements totalling 217 million at 30 June 2014 exchange rates to resolve with UK and US federal authorities legacy issues regarding the manipulation several years ago of Group companies submissions to the British Bankers Association BBA London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and Sterling Repo Rate.
On LIBOR, the Group has reached settlements with the FCA in the United Kingdom, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and the United States Department of Justice DOJ in relation to investigations into submissions between May 2006 and 2009 and related systems and controls failings.
The settlements in relation to LIBOR are part of an industrywide investigation into the setting of interbank offered rates across a range of currencies.
Under the settlement, the Group has paid 35 million, 62 million and 50 million to the FCA, CFTC and DOJ respectively.
As part of the settlement with the DOJ, the Group has also entered into a twoyear Deferred Prosecution Agreement in relation to one count of wire fraud relating to the setting of LIBOR.
In relation to the BBA Sterling Repo Rate, the Group has reached a settlement with the FCA regarding submissions made between April 2008 and September 2009.
This issue involved four individuals who the FCA has concluded manipulated BBA Repo Rate submissions to reduce fees payable under the Special Liquidity Scheme SLS.
The issue was proactively brought to the FCAs attention when it was identified by the Group as part of its internal investigation into the LIBOR issues.
The Group has paid 70 million to the FCA in connection with the resolution of the BBA Repo Rate issue and related systems and controls failings.
Both the CFTC and DOJ settlements are in respect of LIBOR only and neither agency has taken action regarding the BBA Repo Rate.
The BBA Repo Rate was used by the Bank of England BoE to calculate the fees for the SLS.
During the period that Lloyds TSB and HBOS used the SLS they paid 1,278 million in fees, just under half of all the fees payable by the industry under the Scheme.
As a result of the actions of the four individuals involved, the Group has paid nearly 8 million to compensate the BoE for amounts underpaid by Lloyds TSB and HBOS and the other banks that used the SLS.
Interest rate hedging products In June 2012, a number of banks, including the Group, reached agreement with the FSA now FCA to carry out a review of sales made since 1 December 2001 of interest rate hedging products IRHP to certain small and mediumsized businesses.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had identified 1,676 sales of IRHPs to customers within scope of the agreement with the FCA which have opted in and are being reviewed and, where appropriate, redressed.
The Group agreed that on conclusion of this review it would provide redress to any inscope customers where appropriate.
The Group continues to review the remaining cases within the scope of the agreement with the FCA but has met all of the regulators requirements to date.
During 2014, the Group has charged a further 150 million in respect of estimated redress costs, increasing the total amount provided for redress and related administration costs for inscope customers to 680 million 31 December 2013: 530 million.
This increase relates to an extension in the timetable for customers being able to optin to the review and the volume and complexity of claims.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group has utilised 571 million 31 December 2013: 162 million, with 109 million 31 December 2013: 368 million of the provision remaining.
Other legal actions and regulatory matters In the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters.
The Group also receives complaints and claims from customers in connection with its past conduct and, where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred as a result of the conclusions reached.
In 2014 the provision was increased by a further 430 million, in respect of a number of matters affecting the Retail, Commercial Banking and Consumer Finance divisions, including potential claims and remediation in respect of products sold through the branch network and continuing investigation of matters highlighted through industrywide regulatory reviews, as well as legacy product sales and historical systems and controls such as those governing legacy incentive schemes.
This brings the total amount charged to 730 million of which 209 million had been utilised at 31 December 2014.
This increase reflected the Groups assessment of a limited number of matters under discussion, none of which currently is individually considered financially material in the context of the Group.
VACANT LEASEHOLD PROPERTY Vacant leasehold property provisions are made by reference to a prudent estimate of expected sublet income, compared to the head rent, and the possibility of disposing of the Groups interest in the lease, taking into account conditions in the property market.
These provisions are reassessed on a biannual basis and will normally run off over the period of underrecovery of the leases concerned, currently averaging four years: where a property is disposed of earlier than anticipated, any remaining balance in the provision relating to that property is released.
OTHER Provisions are made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes irrevocably committed to the expenditure.
Other provisions include those arising out of the insolvency of a third party insurer, which remains exposed to asbestos and pollution claims in the US.
The ultimate cost and timing of payments are uncertain.
The provision held of 28 million at 31 December 2014 represents managements current best estimate of the cost after having regard to actuarial estimates of future losses.

LLOYDS BANKING GROUP EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES The executive share option schemes were longterm incentive schemes available to certain senior executives of the Group, with grants usually made annually.
Options were granted within limits set by the rules of the schemes relating to the number of shares under option and the price payable on the exercise of options.
The last grant of executive options was made in August 2005.
These options were granted without a performance multiplier and the maximum limit for the grant of options in normal circumstances was three times annual salary.
Between March 2004 and August 2004, the aggregate value of the award based upon the market price at the date of grant could not exceed four times the executives annual remuneration and, normally, the limit for the grant of options to an executive in any one year would be equal to 1.5 times annual salary with a maximum performance multiplier of 3.5.
Performance conditions for executive options For options granted in 2004 The performance condition was linked to the performance of Lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 17 companies including Lloyds Banking Group plc.
The performance condition was measured over a three year period which commenced at the end of the financial year preceding the grant of the option and continued until the end of the third subsequent year.
If the performance condition was not then met, it was measured at the end of the fourth financial year.
If the condition was not then met, the options would lapse.
To meet the performance conditions, the Groups ranking against the comparator group was required to be at least ninth.
The full grant of options only became exercisable if the Group was ranked first.
A performance multiplier of between nil and 100 per cent was applied below this level to calculate the number of shares in respect of which options granted to Executive Directors would become exercisable, and were calculated on a sliding scale.
If Lloyds Banking Group plc was ranked below median the options would not be exercisable.
Options granted to senior executives other than Executive Directors were not so highly leveraged and, as a result, different performance multipliers were applied to their options.
For the majority of executives, options were granted with the performance condition but with no performance multiplier.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 261 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 48: SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Options granted in 2004 became exercisable as the performance condition was met on the retest.
The performance condition vested at 14 per cent for Executive Directors, 24 per cent for Managing Directors, and 100 per cent for all other executives.
All options granted in 2004 lapsed on 18 March 2014 and 12 August 2014.
For options granted in 2005 The same conditions applied as for grants made in 2004, except that: the performance condition was linked to the performance of Lloyds Banking Group plcs total shareholder return calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price against a comparator group of 15 companies including Lloyds Banking Group plc: if the performance condition was not met at the end of the third subsequent year, the options would lapse: and the full grant of options became exercisable only if the Group was ranked in the top four places of the comparator group.
A sliding scale applied between fourth and eighth positions.
If Lloyds Banking Group was ranked below the median ninth or below the options would lapse.
Options granted in 2005 became exercisable as the performance condition was met when tested.
The performance condition vested at 82.5 per cent for all options granted.

NOTE 50: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS INTERCHANGE FEES On 11 September 2014, the European Court of Justice the ECJ upheld the European Commissions 2007 decision that an infringement of EU competition law had arisen from arrangements whereby MasterCard issuers charged a uniform fallback multilateral interchange fee MIF in respect of crossborder transactions in relation to the use of a MasterCard or Maestro branded payment card.
In parallel: the European Commission has proposed legislation to regulate interchange fees which continues through the EU legislative process.
A political agreement has been reached between the European Parliament and the Council and the legislation is expected to be adopted and come into force in the second quarter of 2015 with certain articles applying six months or a year after that the adoption and entry into force dates remain subject to change : the European Commission has adopted commitments proposed by VISA to settle an investigation into VISAs crossborder interchange arrangements and aspects of its scheme rules.
VISA has, amongst other things, agreed to reduce the level of interchange fees for crossborder card transactions to: 30 basis points for credit and 20 basis points for debit.
VISA has also changed a number of its rules in relation to crossborder acquiring.
MasterCard unilaterally undertook, amongst other things, to reduce the level of crossborder interchange fees to the same levels as agreed between the Commission and Visa: the Commission also continues to pursue other competition investigations into MasterCard and Visa probing, amongst other things, interchange paid in respect of cards issued outside the EEA: litigation continues in the English High Court against both Visa and MasterCard.
This litigation has been brought by several retailers who are seeking damages for allegedly overpaid MIFs: the new UK payments regulator may exercise its powers, when these come in to force in April 2015, to regulate domestic interchange fees.
In November 2014, the Competition and Markets Authority the CMA announced that it would not reopen the investigation into domestic interchange levels at this time following MasterCards agreement to introduce a phased reduction of domestic interchange rates commencing in April 2015.
In addition, the FCA has started a market study in relation to the UK credit cards market.
The ultimate impact on the Group of the above investigations, regulatory or legislative developments and the litigation against VISA and MasterCard can only be known at the conclusion of these matters.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 271 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 50: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS CONTINUED LIBOR AND OTHER TRADING RATES As set out in more detail in note 40, on 28 July 2014, the Group announced that it had reached settlements totalling 217 million at 30 June 2014 exchange rates to resolve with UK and US federal authorities legacy issues regarding the manipulation several years ago of Group companies submissions to the British Bankers Association BBA London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and Sterling Repo Rate.
The Group continues to cooperate with various other government and regulatory authorities, including the Serious Fraud Office, the European and Swiss Competition Commissions, and a number of US State Attorneys General, in conjunction with their investigations into submissions made by panel members to the bodies that set LIBOR and various other interbank offered rates.
Certain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have also been named as defendants in private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar and Japanese Yen LIBOR.
The claims have been asserted by plaintiffs claiming to have had an interest in various types of financial instruments linked to US Dollar and Japanese Yen LIBOR.
The allegations in these cases, the majority of which have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in multidistrict litigation proceedings MDL in the US Federal Court for the Southern District of New York the District Court, are substantially similar to each other.
The lawsuits allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO and the Commodity Exchange Act CEA, as well as various state statutes and common law doctrines.
Certain of the plaintiffs claims have been dismissed by the District Court.
The Group is also reviewing its activities in relation to the setting of certain foreign exchange daily benchmark rates and related matters, following the FCAs publicised initiation of an investigation into other financial institutions in relation to this activity.
The Group is cooperating with the FCA and other regulators and is providing information about the Groups review to those regulators.
In addition, the Group, together with a number of other banks, was named as a defendant in several actions filed in the District Court between late 2013 and February 2014, in which the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants manipulated WM Reuters foreign exchange rates in violation of US antitrust laws.
On 31 March 2014, plaintiffs effectively withdrew their claims against the Group but not against all defendants by filing a superseding consolidated and amended pleading against a number of other defendants without naming any Group entity as a defendant.
It is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of the various outstanding regulatory investigations not encompassed by the settlements, any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Groups contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale.
UK SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION In August 2014, the Group and a number of former directors were named as defendants in a claim filed in the English High Court by a number of claimants who held shares in Lloyds TSB Group plc LTSB prior to the acquisition of HBOS plc, alleging breaches of fiduciary and tortious duties in relation to information provided to shareholders in connection with the acquisition and the recapitalisation of LTSB.
The claim is at an early stage and so it is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact on the Group if any, but it intends to defend the claim vigorously.
FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPENSATION SCHEME The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS is the UKs independent statutory compensation fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms and pays compensation if a firm is unable or likely to be unable to pay claims against it.
The FSCS is funded by levies on the authorised financial services industry.
Each deposittaking institution contributes towards the FSCS levies in proportion to their share of total protected deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Following the default of a number of deposit takers in 2008, the FSCS borrowed funds from HM Treasury to meet the compensation costs for customers of those firms.
At the end of the latest FSCS scheme year 31 March 2014, the principal balance outstanding on these loans was 16,591 million 31 March 2013: 17,246 million.
Although the substantial majority of this loan will be repaid from funds the FSCS receives from asset sales, surplus cash flow or other recoveries in relation to the assets of the firms that defaulted, any shortfall will be funded by deposittaking participants of the FSCS.
The amount of future levies payable by the Group depends on a number of factors including the amounts recovered by the FSCS from asset sales, the Groups participation in the deposittaking market at 31 December, the level of protected deposits and the population of deposittaking participants.
INVESTIGATION INTO BANK OF SCOTLAND AND REPORT ON HBOS The FSAs enforcement investigation into Bank of Scotland plcs Corporate division between 2006 and 2008 concluded with the publication of a Final Notice on 9 March 2012.
No financial penalty was imposed on the Group or Bank of Scotland plc.
On 12 September 2012 the FSA confirmed it was starting work on a public interest report on HBOS.
That report is now being produced as a joint PRA FCA report.
Although the Terms of Reference for the HBOS review issued on 11 July 2014 stated an aim to publish the final report by the end of 2014, the report has not yet been published.
US-SWISS TAX PROGRAMME The US Department of Justice the DOJ and the Swiss Federal Department of Finance announced on 29 August 2013 a programme the Programme for Swiss banks to obtain resolution concerning their status in connection with ongoing investigations by the DOJ into individuals and entities that use foreign i. e. nonUS bank accounts to evade US taxes and reporting requirements, and individuals and entities that facilitate or have facilitated the evasion of such taxes and reporting requirements.
Swiss banks that chose to participate notified the DOJ of their election to categorise their relevant banking operations according to one of a number of defined categories under the Programme.
The Group carried out private banking operations in Switzerland with assets under management of approximately 7 billion.
Those operations were sold in November 2013.
Therefore, as a protective measure, in December 2013 the Group notified the DOJ of its intent to participate in the Programme.
Having completed due diligence under the terms of the Programme, the Group has concluded that its further participation in the Programme is not warranted and it has communicated to the DOJ its decision to withdraw from the Programme.
272 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 50: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS CONTINUED TAX AUTHORITIES The Group provides for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.
This includes open matters where Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC adopt a different interpretation and application of tax law which might lead to additional tax.
The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010.
In the second half of 2013 HMRC informed the Group that their interpretation of the UK rules, permitting the offset of such losses, denies the claim: if HMRCs position is found to be correct management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately 600 million and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax asset of approximately 400 million.
The Group does not agree with HMRCs position and, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.
RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE REPOSSESSIONS In August 2014, the Northern Ireland High Court handed down judgment in favour of the borrowers in relation to three residential mortgage test cases, concerning certain aspects of the Groups practice with respect to the recalculation of contractual monthly instalments of customers in arrears.
The Group is reviewing the issues raised by the judgment and will respond as appropriate to any investigations or proceedings that may in due course be instigated as a result of these issues.
OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS AND REGULATORY MATTERS In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought by or on behalf of employees, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters.
However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.

276 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 51: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 2 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use nonmarket observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Group manages valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on a net basis: the Group determines their fair values on the basis of their net exposures.
In all other cases, fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined on the basis of their gross exposures.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the longterm relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and posttrading.
Pretrade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Posttrade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing inhouse pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, overthecounter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
Level 1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.
Level 2 Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Examples of such financial instruments include most overthecounter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain assetbacked securities.
Level 3 Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups assetbacked securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.

Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation.
Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments Unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current marketbased multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 281 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 51: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third party valuations.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.

In the case of assetbacked securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available.
Conversely transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.
Valuation methodology for financial liabilities, excluding derivatives Liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss These principally comprise debt securities in issue which are classified as level 2 and their fair value is determined using techniques whose inputs are based on observable market data.
The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2014, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of 6,739 million 2013: 5,267 million of the Groups debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a gain of 33 million 2013: gain of 40 million.
C Derivatives All of the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2014, such assets totalled 36,128 million 31 December 2013: 30,804 million and liabilities totalled 33,187 million 31 December 2013: 27,658 million.
The table below analyses these derivative balances by valuation methodology level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 277.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the year.
Where the Groups derivative assets and liabilities are not traded on an exchange, they are valued using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and options pricing models, as appropriate.
The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 283 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 51: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves.
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable atthemoney data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for outofthemoney positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on assetbacked securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis assetbacked security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying assetbacked security.
The Groups level 3 derivative assets include 646 million 2013: 1,212 million in respect of the value of the embedded equity conversion feature of the Enhanced Capital Notes issued in December 2009.
The embedded equity conversion feature is valued by comparing the market price of the Enhanced Capital Notes with the market price of similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The latter is calculated by discounting the expected Enhanced Capital Note cash flows in the absence of a conversion using prevailing market yields for similar capital securities without the conversion feature.
The market price of the Enhanced Capital Notes was calculated with reference to multiple broker quotes.

284 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 51: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED i Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments, excluding monoline counterparties The following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 498 897 Income statement charge credit 95 241 Transfers 15 158 At 31 December 608 498 Represented by: 2014 2013 m m Credit Valuation Adjustment 568 485 Debit Valuation Adjustment 85 122 Funding Valuation Adjustment 125 135 608 498 Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments CVA and DVA are applied to the Groups overthecounter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.
A CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure asset.
A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure liability.
These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Groups own credit spread respectively.
The CVA is sensitive to: the current size of the marktomarket position on the uncollateralised asset: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset: and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness.
In circumstances where exposures to a counterparty become impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and assessed for specific loss alongside other nonderivative assets and liabilities that the counterparty may have with the Group.
Market Credit Default Swap CDS spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties.
For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used.
The Loss Given Default LGD is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.
The combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a ten per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by 105 million.
Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes.
For these, the CVA is calculated on an addon basis in total contributing 2 million of the overall CVA balance at 31 December 2014.
The DVA is sensitive to: the current size of the marktomarket position on the uncollateralised liability: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability: and the Groups own CDS spread.
A one per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 122 million to 207 million.
The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.
A 1 per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a 183 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to 300 million.
The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.
The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding certain uncollateralised derivative positions where the Group considers that this cost is included in market pricing.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by approximately 7 million.
ii Market liquidity The Group includes mid to bidoffer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Groups trading positions within a timeframe that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups derivative trading business held mid to bidoffer valuation adjustments of 74 million 2013: 70 million.

286 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 51: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Unobservable inputs Significant unobservable inputs affecting the valuation of debt securities, unlisted equity investments and derivatives are as follows: Interest rates and inflation rates are referenced in some derivatives where the payoff that the holder of the derivative receives depends on the behaviour of those underlying references through time.
Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality: higher spreads lead to a lower fair value.
Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour: higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible outcomes.
Earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments: a higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value.
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions Valuation techniques applied to many of the Groups level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent.
The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.
Debt securities Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups structured credit investment by flexing credit spreads.
Derivatives Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups derivative portfolios as follows: In respect of the embedded equity conversion feature of the Enhanced Capital Notes, the sensitivity was based on the absolute difference between the actual price of the enhanced capital note and the closest, alternative broker quote available plus the impact of applying a 10 bps increase decrease in the market yield used to derive a market price for similar bonds without the conversion feature.
The effect of interdependency of the assumptions is not material to the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions to the valuations of derivative financial instruments.
Uncollateralised inflation swaps are valued using appropriate discount spreads for such transactions.
These spreads are not generally observable for longer maturities.
The reasonably possible alternative valuations reflect flexing of the spreads for the differing maturities to alternative values of between 3 bps and 167 bps 2013: 62 bps and 192 bps.
Swaptions are priced using industry standard option pricing models.
Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities.
To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 4 per cent to 120 per cent 2013: 3 per cent and 112 per cent.
Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered: for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple: the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations: and in line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investments portfolios.

Valuation methodology Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates due to their short term nature.
The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
To determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics.
A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending: these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows.
For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.
No adjustment is made to put it in place by the Group to manage its interest rate exposure.
Loans and advances to banks The carrying value of short dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value.
The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.
Debt securities The fair values of debt securities, which were previously within assets held for trading and were reclassified to loans and receivables, are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
Reverse repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the shortterm nature of these instruments.

Valuation methodology Deposits from banks and customer deposits The fair value of bank and customer deposits repayable on demand is assumed to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue The fair value of shortterm debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities is calculated based on quoted market prices where available.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Groups own credit spread.
Subordinated liabilities The fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments.
Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.
Repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short term nature of these instruments.
5 RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS No financial assets have been reclassified in 2014 or 2013.
During 2012 the Group reviewed its holding of government securities classified as heldtomaturity and in view of the fact that it was no longer the Groups intention to hold these to maturity, securities with a carrying amount of 10,811 million and a fair value of 11,979million were reclassified as availableforsale financial assets in December 2012.
At 31 December 2014, the securities reclassified that were still retained by the Group were carried at their fair value of 1,284 million 2013: 1,117 million.

The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respective of derivative transactions covered by these agreements.
The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of nonpayment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS 32.
The effects of over collateralisation have not been taken into account in the above table.
292 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Groups activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.
The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: liquidity risk: capital risk: and insurance risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and capital can be found on pages 107 to 170.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
MARKET RISK The Group uses various market risk measures for risk reporting and setting risk appetite limits and triggers.
These measures include Value at Risk and Stress Scenarios.
Interest rate risk In the Groups retail banking business interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of Englands base rate.
There is a relatively small volume of deposits whose rate is contractually fixed for their term to maturity.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion of the Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed for periods of up to five years or longer.
The Group establishes two types of hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk: fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
At 31 December 2014 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was 115,394 million 2013: 154,657 million with a net fair value asset of 1,511 million 2013: asset of 1,618 million note 16.
The losses on the hedging instruments were 2,866 million 2013: losses of 933 million.
The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 2,720 million 2013: gains of 872 million.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the commercial business.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2014 was 518,746 million 2013: 559,690 million with a net fair value liability of 930 million 2013: liability of 1,347 million note 16.
In 2014, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of 56 million 2013: loss of 60 million.
Currency risk Foreign exchange exposures comprise those originating in treasury trading activities and structural foreign exchange exposures, which arise from investment in the Groups overseas operations.
The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London.
Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 139.
Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of the net investment in certain foreign operations using currency borrowings.
In 2014, an ineffectiveness loss of 1 million before and after tax 2013: ineffectiveness gain of 16 million before tax and 12 million after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from net investment hedges.

Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and measure the credit risk of loans and advances to customers and banks at a counterparty level using three components: i the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations: ii the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default: and iii the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default.
The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales and credit derivative based transactions.
Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unitlinked and With Profits funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for nonderivative offbalance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.
2 Offset items comprise deposit amounts available for offset and amounts available for offset under master netting arrangements that do not meet the criteria under IAS 32 to enable loans and advances and derivative assets respectively to be presented net of these balances in the financial statements.
4 Includes assets within the Groups unitlinked funds for which credit risk is borne by the policyholders and assets within the Groups WithProfits funds for which credit risk is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back related contract liabilities.

Concentrations of exposure The Groups management of concentration risk includes single name, industry sector and country limits as well as controls over the Groups overall exposure to certain products.
Further information on the Groups management of this risk is included within Credit risk mitigation, Risk management on page 118.
At 31 December 2014 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages comprising 68 per cent of total loans and advances to customers and to financial, business and other services comprising 9 per cent of the total.
For further information on concentrations of the Groups loans, refer to note 18.
Following the continuing reduction in the Groups nonUK activities, an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region has not been provided.
C. Credit quality of assets Loans and receivables The disclosures in the table below and those on pages 297 and 298 are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition date on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The remaining acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments in respect of this lending are therefore identified separately in this table.
The analysis of lending between retail and commercial has been prepared based upon the type of exposure and not the business segment in which the exposure is recorded.
Included within retail are exposures to personal customers and small businesses, whilst included within commercial are exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions.
296 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss are disclosed in note 2 H. All impaired loans which exceed certain thresholds, principally within the Groups Commercial Banking division, are individually assessed for impairment by reviewing expected future cash flows including those that could arise from the realisation of security.
Included in loans and receivables are advances which are individually determined to be impaired with a gross amount before impairment allowances of 8,522 million 31 December 2013: 22,390 million.
The table below sets out the reconciliation of the allowance for impairment losses of 6,414 million 2013: 11,966 million shown in note 21 to the allowance for impairment losses on an underlying basis of 7,652 million 2013: 15,707 million shown above: 2014 2013 m m Allowance for impairment losses on loans and advances to customers 6,414 11,966 1 HBOS allowance at 16 January 2009 11,147 11,147 2 HBOS charge covered by fair value adjustments 12,066 11,815 Amounts subsequently written off 22,426 19,674 787 3,288 Foreign exchange and other movements 451 453 Allowance for impairment losses on loans and advances to customers on an underlying basis 7,652 15,707 1 Comprises an allowance held at 31 December 2008 of 10,693 million and a charge for the period from 1 January 2009 to 16 January 2009 of 454 million.

The definitions of good quality, satisfactory quality, lower quality and below standard, but not impaired applying to retail and commercial are not the same, reflecting the different characteristics of these exposures and the way they are managed internally, and consequently totals are not provided.
Commercial lending has been classified using internal probability of default rating models mapped so that they are comparable to external credit ratings.
Good quality lending comprises the lower assessed default probabilities, with other classifications reflecting progressively higher default risk.
Classifications of retail lending incorporate expected recovery levels for mortgages, as well as probabilities of default assessed using internal rating models.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Groups unitlinked funds is borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of withprofits funds is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 301 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Derivative assets An analysis of derivative assets is given in note 16.
The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups maximum credit risk relating to derivative assets of 14,199 million 2013: 11,325 million, cash collateral of 3,651 million 2013: 2,702 million was held and a further 2,043 million was due from OECD banks 2013: 2,372 million.

Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Of the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held at 31 December 2014 of 682 million 2013: 732 million, 363 million 2013: 383 million were due from insurers with a credit rating of AA or above.
Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
D. Collateral held as security for financial assets A general description of collateral held as security in respect of financial instruments is provided on page 119.
The Group holds collateral against loans and receivables and irrevocable loan commitments: qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below.
Collateral held as security for trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.
Loans and receivables The disclosures below are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition, such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below.
The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising assetbacked securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and advances to banks The Group may require collateral before entering into a credit commitment with another bank, depending on the type of financial product and the counterparty involved, and netting arrangements are obtained whenever possible and to the extent that such agreements are legally enforceable.
Collateral is held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions.
There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of 1,899 million 2013: 183 million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 1,886 million 2013: 183 million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.
Loans and advances to customers The Group holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of mortgages over residential and commercial real estate, charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable, charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities, and guarantees received from third parties.
302 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Retail lending Mortgages An analysis by loantovalue ratio of the Groups residential mortgage lending is provided below.
The value of collateral used in determining the loan tovalue ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowance for indexation error and dilapidations.
For nonmortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral will often include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.
The majority of nonmortgage retail lending is unsecured.
At 31 December 2014, impaired nonmortgage lending amounted to 1,470 million, net of an impairment allowance of 577 million 2013: 1,696 million, net of an impairment allowance of 1,044 million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of this lending was 110 million 2013: 144 million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation and the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Unimpaired nonmortgage retail lending amounted to 38,560 million 2013: 37,369 million.
Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.
The Group credit risk disclosures for unimpaired nonmortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.
The value of collateral is reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower.
Unimpaired nonmortgage retail lending, including any associated collateral, is managed on a customerbycustomer basis rather than a portfolio basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired nonmortgage retail lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Commercial lending Reverse repurchase transactions There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 5,148 million 2013: 120 million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 5,155 million 2013: 112 million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
Included in these amounts are collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements amounting to 35 million 2013: 49 million.
Impaired secured lending The value of collateral is reevaluated and its legal soundness reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower: this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and managements strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.
At 31 December 2014, impaired secured commercial lending amounted to 2,539 million, net of an impairment allowance of 3,799 million 2013: 9,845 million, net of an impairment allowance of 11,063 million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was 2,517 million 2013: 6,915 million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation.
For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 303 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Impaired secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services: transport, distribution and hotels: and construction industries.
Unimpaired secured lending Unimpaired secured commercial lending amounted to 57,647 million 2013: 69,108 million.
Commercial lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination.
The types of collateral taken and the frequency with which collateral is required at origination is dependent upon the size and structure of the borrower.
For exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions, the Group will often require the collateral to include a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a mortgage debenture over the companys undertaking and one or more of its assets, and keyman insurance.
The Group maintains policies setting out acceptable collateral, maximum loantovalue ratios and other criteria to be considered when reviewing a loan application.
The decision as to whether or not collateral is required will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit worthiness of the customer.
Other than for project finance, object finance and income producing real estate where charges over the subject assets are a basic requirement, the provision of collateral will not determine the outcome of a credit application.
The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business to generate funds from normal business sources to repay debt.
The extent to which collateral values are actively managed will depend on the credit quality and other circumstances of the obligor.
Although lending decisions are predominantly based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted: this will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal lossgivendefault estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality.
For unimpaired secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.
Unimpaired secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis.
On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for impaired lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding equity shares Included in trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 36,725 million 2013: 29,288 million.
Collateral is held with a fair value of 42,858 million 2013: 32,434 million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
At 31 December 2014, 10,319 million had been repledged 2013: 8,195 million.
In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to 33,721 million 2013: 46,552 million.
Of this amount, 32,686 million 2013: 45,277 million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of 14,199 million 2013: 11,325 million, cash collateral of 3,651 million 2013: 2,702 million was held.
Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies At 31 December 2014, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other creditrelated contingencies of 57,711 million 2013: 59,172 million.
Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on 8,673million 2013: 19,123 million of these balances.
Lending decisions in respect of irrevocable loan commitments are based on the obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
For commercial commitments, it is the Groups practice to request collateral whose value is commensurate with the nature of the commitment.
For retail mortgage commitments, the majority are for mortgages with a loantovalue ratio of less than 100 per cent.
Aggregated collateral information covering the entire balance of irrevocable loan commitments over which security will be taken is not provided to key management personnel.
Collateral repossessed During the year, 828 million of collateral was repossessed 2013: 902 million, consisting primarily of residential property.
In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.
304 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED E. COLLATERAL PLEDGED AS SECURITY The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.
Repurchase transactions Deposits from banks Included in deposits from banks are deposits held as collateral for facilities granted, with a carrying value of 1,075 million 2013: 1,874 million and a fair value of 1,075 million 2013: 1,874 million.
Customer deposits Included in customer deposits in 2013 were deposits held as collateral for facilities granted, with a carrying value of 2,978 million and a fair value of 3,114 million.
In addition, collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of repurchase agreements amounted to 6 million 2013: 416 million.
Trading and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secure borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 56,696 million 2013: 37,999 million.
Securities lending transactions The following financial assets on the balance sheet have been pledged as collateral as part of securities lending transactions: 2014 2013 m m Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 9,955 9,928 Loans and advances to customers 1,393 14,927 Debt securities classified as loans and receivables 88 89 Availableforsale financial assets 8,363 2,311 19,799 27,255 Securitisations and covered bonds In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Groups assetbacked conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.
Further details of these assets are provided in notes 19 and 20.
F. TREATMENT OF CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL STRESS The Group operates a number of schemes to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress.
The material elements of these schemes are described in the Risk Management report on pages 120 and 121 and further details relating to those cases where the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.
Retail customers Forbearance activities The Group classifies the treatments offered to retail customers who have experienced financial difficulty into the following categories: Reduced contractual monthly payment: a temporary account change to assist customers through periods of financial difficulty where arrears do not accrue at the original contractual payments, for example temporary interest only arrangements and shortterm payment holidays granted in collections.
Any arrears existing at the commencement of the arrangement are retained: Reduced payment arrangements: a temporary arrangement for customers in financial distress where arrears accrue at the contractual payment, for example shortterm arrangements to pay: Term extensions: a permanent account change for customers in financial distress where the overall term of the mortgage is extended resulting in a lower contractual monthly payment: and Repair: a permanent account change used to repair a customers position where they have emerged from financial difficulty, for example capitalisation of arrears.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 305 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored programmes The Group participates in a number of UK Government sponsored programmes designed to support households, which are described on page 121.
Where these schemes provide borrowers with a state benefit that is used to service the loan, there is no change in the reported status of the loan which is managed and reported in accordance with its original terms.
The Group assesses whether a loan benefiting from a UK Government sponsored programme is impaired using the same accounting policies and practices as it does for loans not benefiting from such a programme.
There is no direct impact on the impairment status of a loan benefiting from the Mortgage Rescue schemes, as these schemes involve the purchase, and eventual sale, of the property.
The loans included within the Income Support for Mortgage Interest scheme may be impaired, in accordance with the normal definition of impairment.
The Income Support for Mortgage Interest scheme remains the most successful of the Government backed schemes.
It is the longestrunning, is the most widely known and provides both the customer and the Group with an assurance as to the maintenance of at least two years worth of interest payments.
The Group estimates that customers representing approximately 2.3 billion of its mortgage exposures are receiving this benefit.
This includes those who are also receiving other treatments for financial difficulty.
Customers in financial difficulty receiving support under other schemes The Group measures the success of a forbearance scheme based upon the proportion of customers maintaining or improving their arrears position over the 24 months following the exit from a forbearance treatment.
For temporary treatments, 90 per cent of customers who have accepted temporary interestonly concessions and 76 per cent of customers accepting reduced payment arrangements have maintained or improved their arrears position.
For permanent treatments, 80 per cent of customers who have accepted capitalisations of arrears and 84 per cent of customers who have accepted term extensions have maintained or improved their arrears position.
Forbearance identification and classification The Group classifies a retail account as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession.
Accounts are classified as forborne only for the period of time which the exposure is known to be, or may still be, in financial difficulty.
Where temporary forbearance is granted, exit criteria are applied to include accounts until they are known to no longer be in financial difficulty.
Details of the exit criteria are shown in the analysis below.
Where the treatment involves a permanent change to the contractual basis of the customers account such as a capitalisation of arrears or term extension, the Group classifies the balance as forborne for a period of 24 months, after which no distinction is made between these accounts and others where no change has been made.
Collective impairment assessment of retail loans subject to forbearance Secured Loans which are forborne are grouped with other assets with similar risk characteristics and assessed collectively for impairment as described below.
The loans are not considered as impaired loans unless they meet the Groups definition of an impaired asset.
The Groups approach is to ensure that provisioning models, supported by management judgement, appropriately reflect the underlying loss risk of exposures.
The Group uses sophisticated behavioural scoring to assess customers credit risk.
The underlying behavioural scorecards consider many different characteristics of customer behaviour, both static and dynamic, from internal sources and also from credit bureaux data, including characteristics that may identify when a customer has been in arrears on products held with other firms.
Hence, these models take a range of potential indicators of customer financial distress into account.
The performance of such models is monitored and challenged on an ongoing basis, in line with the Groups model governance policies.
The models are also regularly recalibrated to reflect up to date customer behaviour and market conditions.
Specifically, regular detailed analysis of modelled provision outputs is undertaken to demonstrate that the risk of forbearance or other similar activities is recognised, that the outcome period adequately captures the risk and that the underlying risk is appropriately reflected.
Where this is not the case, additional provisions are applied to capture the risk.
Unsecured Credit risk provisioning for the retail unsecured portfolio is undertaken on a purely collective basis.
The approach used is based on segmented cash flow models, divided into two primary streams for loans judged to be impaired and those that are not.
Accounts subject to repayment plans and collections refinance loans are among those considered to be impaired.
For exposures that are judged to be impaired, provisions are determined through modelling the expected cure rates, writeoff propensity and cash flows with segments explicitly relating to repayment plans and refinance loans treatments.
Payments of less than the monthly contractual amount are reflected in reduced cash flow forecasts when calculating the impairment allowance for these accounts.
The outputs of the models are monitored and challenged on an ongoing basis.
The models are run monthly meaning that current market conditions and customer processes are reflected in the output.
Where the risks identified are not captured in the underlying models, appropriate additional provisions are made.

Forborne loans have decreased by 447 million in 2014, to 280 million, driven by the disposal of impaired assets during 2014.
The movements during the year for forborne loans and advances in the Irish secured retail lending portfolio was as follows: m At 1 January 2014 727 Classified as forborne during the year 261 Written off sold 348 Good exit from forbearance 324 Redeemed or repaid 13 Exchange and other movements 23 At 31 December 2014 280 BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 309 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Commercial customers Forbearance A key factor in determining whether the Group treats a commercial customer as forborne is the granting of a concession to a borrower who experiences, or is believed to be about to experience, financial difficulty and which is outside the Groups current risk appetite.
Where a concession is granted to a customer that is not in financial difficulty or the risk profile is considered within the Groups current risk appetite, the concession would not be considered to be an act of forbearance.
The Group does not believe forbearance reporting is appropriate for derivatives, available for sale assets and the trading book where assets are marked to market daily.
The Group recognises that forbearance alone is not necessarily an indicator of impaired status but it is a trigger for the review of the customers credit profile.
If there is any concern over future cash flows and the Group incurring a loss, then forborne loans will be classified as impaired in accordance with the Groups impairment policy.
Recovery can sometimes be through improvement in market or economic conditions, or the customer may benefit from access to alternative sources of liquidity such as an equity injection.
These can be especially relevant in real estate or other asset backed transactions where a fire sale of assets in a weak market may be unattractive.
Depending on circumstances and when operated within robust parameters and controls, the Group believes forbearance can help support the customer in the short to mediumterm.
The Group expects to have unimpaired forborne assets within its portfolios, although the majority of these cases will be managed in the Business Support Unit, where more intensive management and monitoring is available.
Unimpaired forborne assets are included in calculating the overall collective unimpaired provision, which uses the historical observed default rate and loss emergence period of the relevant portfolio as a whole as part of its calculation.
Whilst the material portfolios have been reviewed for forbearance, some nonretail loans and advances in Commercial Banking and Runoff divisions have not been reviewed on the basis that the level is relatively immaterial or because the concept of forbearance is not relevant.
Types of forbearance The Groups strategy and offer of forbearance is largely dependent on the individual situation and early identification, control and monitoring are key to supporting the customer and protecting the Group.
Concessions are often provided to help the customer with their day to day liquidity and working capital.
A number of options are available to the Group where a customer is facing financial difficulty, and each case is treated depending on its own specific circumstances.
Forbearance treatments may include changes to: Contractual payment terms for example loan extensions, or changes to debt servicing terms, and Nonpayment contractual terms for example covenant amendments or waivers where the modifications enable default to be avoided.
The four main types of forbearance concessions to commercial customers in financial difficulty are set out below: Covenants: This includes temporary and permanent waivers, amendment or resetting of nonpayment contractual covenants including LTV and interest cover.
The granting of this type of concession in itself would not result in the loan being classified as impaired: Extensions Alterations: This includes extension and or alteration of repayment terms to a level outside of market or the Groups risk appetite due to the customers inability to make existing contractual repayment terms: amendments to an interest rate to a level considered outside of market or the Groups risk appetite, or other amendments such as changes to debt servicing arrangements: Forgiveness: This includes debt for equity swaps or partial debt forgiveness.
This type of forbearance will always give rise to impairment: and Multiple type of forbearance a combination of the above three.
Forbearance identification and classification All nonretail loans and advances in Commercial Banking and Runoff Divisions are reviewed at least annually by the independent Risk Division.
As part of the Groups long established Credit Risk Classification system for commercial customers, every loan and advance in the good book is categorised as either good or watchlist.
The watchlist is further categorised depending on the current and expected credit risk attaching to the customer and the transaction.
All watchlist names are reviewed by the Business and independent Risk function regularly, and the classification is updated if required.
Any concession granted to a customer is reviewed and must be approved by Risk.
If Risk determine that the customer is in, or about to be in, financial difficulty, then any concession granted outside the Groups current risk appetite is treated as forbearance and in most cases, the obligor is transferred to Business Support Unit BSU.
Any event that causes concern over future payments from the customer is likely to result in the asset being assessed for impairment and, if required, an impairment allowance recognised.
If impairment is identified, the customer is immediately transferred to Business Support Unit if not already managed there and the lending will be treated as an impaired asset.
All nonretail impaired assets are considered as having been granted some form of forbearance.
Impaired loans and advances exist only in the BSU within Commercial Banking Division: and Runoff Division.
A portfolio approach is taken for SME customers with exposures below 1 million managed in BSU.
All customers with exposures below 1 million are reported as forborne whilst they are managed by BSU whether impaired or unimpaired.
310 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED All reviews performed in the good book, Business Support Unit within Commercial Banking or in the Runoff division include analysis of latest financial information, a consideration of the market and sector the customer operates in, performance against plan and revised terms and conditions granted as part of the forbearance concession.
The Group no longer reports as forborne nonpayment concessions to unimpaired obligors if the revised terms are within the Groups risk appetite and the overall risk is acceptable, taking into account the overall structure of facilities together with the current state and expectations of financial strength.
There is no significant impact as a result of this change.
Exit from forbearance classification A customer where forbearance has been granted will remain treated and recorded as forborne until it evidences acceptable performance over a period of time.
This period will depend on a number of factors such as whether the customer is trading in line with its revised plan, it is operating within the new terms and conditions including observation to revised covenants and contractual payments, its financial performance is stable or improving, and there are no undue concerns over its future performance.
As a minimum, this period is currently expected to be at least 12 months following a forbearance event.
However, notwithstanding this, the overriding requirement is that the financial difficulty previously seen has been removed, and the performance has stabilised.
The exception to this 12 month minimum period is where a permanent structure cure is made for example, an injection of new collateral security or a partial repayment of debt to restore an LTV back to within a covenant.
In this case, the obligor may be removed from the forbearance category once the permanent cure has been made.
Once a customer evidences acceptable performance over a period of time of not less than the minimum cure period, the customer may be returned to the mainstream good classification and would no longer be considered forborne.
It is important to note that such a decision can be made only by the independent Risk Division.

The Group previously assumed that all lower quality unimpaired exposures under 5 million were forborne, as were a number of nonmaterial portfolios.
As part of the Groups ongoing review and refinement of forbearance reporting, exposures below 5 million, and non material portfolios, were subject to more granular review which led to a reduction in the level of forbearance previously reported.
The reduction also related to unimpaired loans and advances over 5 million and reflects the curing of a limited number of high value transactions where forbearance was granted some time ago and the obligor is no longer considered in financial difficulty.

Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity.
The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.
The above tables are provided on a contractual basis.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.
BECOMING THE BEST BANK FOR CUSTOMERS 315 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued NOTE 54: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
The Groups financial guarantee contracts are accounted for as financial instruments and measured at fair value on the balance sheet.
The majority of the Groups financial guarantee contracts are callable on demand, were the guaranteed party to fail to meet its obligations.
It is, however, expected that most guarantees will expire unused.
The contractual nominal amounts of these guarantees totalled 7,161 million at 31 December 2014 2013: 8,591 million with 4,133 million expiring within one year: 1,823 million between one and three years: 674 million between three and five years: and 531 million over five years 2013: 4,233 million expiring within one year: 837 million between one and three years: 2,039 million between three and five years: and 1,482 million over five years.
The majority of the Groups nonparticipating investment contract liabilities are unitlinked.
These unitlinked products are invested in accordance with unit fund mandates.
Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.
The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over five years column: interest of approximately 80 million 2013: 85 million per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not included beyond five years.

Liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts are analysed on a behavioural basis, as permitted by IFRS 4, as follows: Up to 1-3 3-12 1-5 Over 5 1 month months months years years Total m m m m m m At 31 December 2014 1,036 1,276 5,100 20,916 58,590 86,918 At 31 December 2013 1,088 1,391 5,231 21,468 53,599 82,777 For insurance and participating investment contracts which are neither unitlinked nor in the Groups withprofit funds, in particular annuity liabilities, the aim is to invest in assets such that the cash flows on investments match those on the projected future liabilities.
The following tables set out the amounts and residual maturities of the Groups off balance sheet contingent liabilities and commitments.
Capital risk appetite is set by the Board, reflecting the Groups strategic plans, regulatory capital constraints and market expectations.
It includes a number of minimum capital ratios in normal and stressed conditions as well as a specific measure for the Insurance business, set by the Insurance Board, taking account of the need to maintain regulatory solvency including appropriate management buffers.
The Board and the Group Chief Executive, assisted by the Group Asset and Liability Committee and the Group Risk Committee, regularly review performance against the risk appetite.
A key metric is the Groups common equity tier 1 CET1 capital ratio for which the Group is now assuming a steady state ratio requirement of around 12 per cent.
Additionally, a series of stress analyses is undertaken during the year to determine the adequacy of the Groups capital resources in adverse economic scenarios including those provided by the PRA.
INSURANCE RISK Insurance risk is the risk of reductions in earnings, capital and or value, through financial or reputational loss, due to fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured underwritten events and to fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements.
This includes fluctuations in profits due to customer behaviour.
The Groups appetite for solvency and earnings in insurance entities is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
Insurance risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress and scenario testing, and, where appropriate, stochastic modelling.
Ongoing monitoring is in place to track the progression of insurance risks.
This normally involves monitoring relevant experiences against expectations, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance risk.

The population of OEICs to be consolidated varies at each reporting date as external investors acquire and divest holdings in the various funds.
The consolidation of these funds is effected by the inclusion of the fund investments and a matching liability to the unitholders: and changes in funds consolidated represent a noncash movement on the balance sheet.
2 When considering the movement on each line of the balance sheet, the impact of foreign exchange rate movements is removed in order to show the underlying cash impact.
3 A number of capital transactions entered into by the Group involved the exchange of existing securities for new issues and as a result there was no related cash flow.

At 31 December 2014, the Group retained an interest of approximately 50 per cent in TSB, which continues to be consolidated by the Group.
As none of these transactions resulted in the Group ceding control of TSB, no gain or loss has been recognised in the Groups income statement.
The shortfall of 171 million between the net proceeds of the three sales and the share of TSBs net assets at book value disposed of has been deducted from the Groups retained earnings.
NOTE 57: FUTURE ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following pronouncements may have a significant effect on the Groups financial statements but are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2014 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
Save as disclosed below, the full impact of these accounting changes is being assessed by the Group.
Pronouncement Nature of change IASB effective date 1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Annual periods beginning IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into one of three measurement on or after 1 January 2018 categories, fair value through profit or loss, fair value through other comprehensive income and amortised cost, on the basis of the objectives of the entitys business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
The requirements for derecognition are broadly unchanged from IAS 39.
The standard retains most of the existing requirements for financial liabilities except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss whereby that part of the fair value change attributable to the entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income.
These changes are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 9 also replaces the existing incurred loss impairment approach with an expected credit loss approach.
This change is likely to result in an increase in the Groups balance sheet provisions for credit losses although the extent of any increase will depend upon, amongst other things, the composition of the Groups lending portfolios and prevailing and forecast economic conditions at the date of implementation.
The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are more closely aligned with risk management practices and follow a more principlebased approach than IAS 39.
The revised requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts Replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
IFRS 15 Annual periods beginning 1 on or after 1 January 2017 with Customers establishes principles for reporting useful information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and services.
Financial instruments, leases and insurance contracts are out of scope and so this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
1 As at 26 February 2015, these pronouncements are awaiting EU endorsement.
