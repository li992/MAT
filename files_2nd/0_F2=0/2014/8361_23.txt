The net proceeds after costs were 73.7 million.
The placing utilised a structure whereby a special-purpose entity issued redeemable preference shares in consideration for the receipt of the cash proceeds net of issue costs arising from the placing.
The Companys ordinary shares were issued as consideration for the transfer to it of the shares, which it did not already own, in the special-purpose entity.
As a result, in the opinion of the directors, the placing qualified for merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 so that the 72.4 million excess of the value of the acquired shares in the special-purpose entity over the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued by the Company was credited to the Companys merger reserve.
1 The 121.4 million merger reserve represents 16.4 million premium on the shares issued on the acquisition of Robert M. Douglas Holdings Plc in 1991, 32.6 million premium on the shares issued on the acquisition of MacLellan Group Plc in 2006 and 72.4 million premium on the shares placed to partially fund the acquisition of Initial Facilities during the period.
2 The hedging and revaluation reserve includes 27.6 million relating to the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets within the joint ventures 2013: 6.5 million.
3 The investment in own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Interserve Plc held by the trustees of the How Group, Bandt and Interserve Employee Benefit Trusts.
The market value of these shares at 31 December 2014 was 4.8 million 2013: 5.3 million.

Basis of preparation and accounting policies Basis of preparation The Interserve Plc consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and comply with the IFRS and related interpretations SIC and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
a Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted and affected the amounts reported in these financial statements: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities IAS 27 Separate financial statements IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting These do not materially impact the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective, and therefore have not been applied in these Group financial statements: IFRS 9 Financial instruments The impact of the sections of IFRS 9 currently issued will result in the Groups project finance interests that are currently treated by the joint-venture companies as being available-for-sale, being treated as a debt carried at fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost.
As a result, movements in the fair value will no longer be taken to Other comprehensive income.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The new standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts.
It will become effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2017, at the earliest.
In advance of its adoption, the Group will conduct a systematic review of all existing major contracts to ensure that the impact and effect of the new standard is fully understood, and changes to the current accounting procedures are highlighted and acted upon.
Except for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 noted above, the directors do not currently anticipate that the adoption of any other standard and interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
b Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements management makes certain judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements.
While these judgements are continually reviewed the facts and circumstances underlying these judgements may change resulting in a change to the estimates that could impact the results of the Group.
In particular: Revenue and margin recognition The policy for revenue recognition on long-term and service contracts is set out in notes 1 d and e. Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regard to the recoverability of amounts due, liabilities arising and the requirement for forward loss provisions.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcomes of these types of contracts, which require assessments and judgements relating to the recovery of precontract costs, changes in work scopes, contract programmes and maintenance liabilities.
PFI financial assets and derivative financial instruments The Groups interests in PFI PPP investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets by the joint-venture entities.
The fair value of these financial assets is measured at each balance sheet date by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset.
The discount rate used is based on long-term LIBOR plus a margin to reflect the risk associated with each project.
The Groups PFI PPP joint-venture and associate companies use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk to which the concessions are exposed within their long-term contractual agreements.
These derivatives are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at their fair value and subsequently remeasured at each balance sheet date at their fair value.
The fair value of derivatives, assessed by discounting future cash flows, constantly changes in response to prevailing market conditions.
Measurement of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets As set out in notes 1 b and h the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
In determining whether goodwill is impaired an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated is required.
This calculation of value in use requires estimates to be made relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows expected from the CGU, and suitable discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the specific economic environment of the relevant CGU.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 115 Retirement benefit obligations In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the Group has disclosed in note 30 the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligations.
In the calculation a number of assumptions around future salary increases, increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation and discount rates have been made.
Small changes in these assumptions can lead to significant changes to the overall scheme liabilities, as disclosed in note 30.
Judgement is also exercised in establishing the fair value of retirement benefit assets, most notably the valuation of the buy-in contract to insure some of the benefits of a subset of the pension membership of the Scheme provided by the insurer.
Property, plant and equipment The rental fleet in Equipment Services has a significant carrying value see note 15.
The great majority of equipment in the rental fleet is depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero over 10 years.
Asset lives are reviewed regularly in light of technological change, prospective utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Due to the transportable nature of the rental fleet, the review for potential impairment is performed on a global basis.
Carrying value of trade and other receivables Allowance for doubtful debt and provisions against other receivables, including amounts due on construction contracts and carrying value of accrued income, are made on a specific basis, based on estimates of irrecoverability determined by market knowledge and past experience.
Acquisition accounting A number of judgements and estimates are necessary in establishing the opening net asset position, fair-value adjustments and the value of intangible assets in respect of businesses acquired.
These include estimates of future revenue, growth rates, customer retention rates and discount rates.
Accounting policies Interserve Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and bound by the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
As disclosed on page 47 the directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the directors are set out below and have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint-venture entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the associates, joint ventures and any newly acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
When an entity has an accounting reference date other than 31 December, due to the influence of a co-shareholder or customer requirements, the consolidation includes management accounts, prepared using these Group accounting policies, drawn up for the year ended 31 December.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly-controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
116 INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued b Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired company.
The acquired companys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Before the adoption of IFRS 3 revised, the cost of acquisition included any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
Costs incurred on acquisitions completed since 1 January 2010, the date of adoption of the revision to IFRS 3, are expensed.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP value at that date, subject to being subsequently tested for impairment.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquired company is initially measured at the minorities proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at the closing rate is taken directly to reserves.
d Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided, net of trade discounts, value added and similar sales-based taxes, after eliminating revenue within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Construction contracts - by reference to services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed see note 1 e Service contracts the value of work carried out during the year as services are provided, including amounts not invoiced Equipment sales at the time of delivery Equipment hire on a straight-line basis over the hire period in accordance with contractual arrangements e Contract accounting Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date determined by surveys of work performed by quantity surveyors in conjunction with clients.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that it will be recoverable.
Profit is only recognised on a construction contract when the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Expected losses are recognised immediately.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 117 f Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, provided that the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Operating software acquired as part of a related item of hardware is capitalised within property, plant and equipment along with the hardware acquired.
Other software licences acquired are capitalised, along with the cost to bring the software into use, within intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis, typically between three and ten years.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned property, plant and equipment - tangible fixed assets are carried at historical cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line or reducing-balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Reducing balance Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% to 7% Leasehold property over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% ii P roperty, plant and equipment held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
h Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets The Group reviews, at least annually, the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets compared to their recoverable amounts to determine whether those assets have suffered an impairment loss see note 13.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
i Investments Investments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Investments are financial assets and are classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k Borrowing costs Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
l PFI bid costs and other pre-contract costs In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company.
If the fee exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the income statement over the construction and early start-up period.
If the agreed fee is less than the amount held by the Group as an asset, the loss is recognised as soon as it is anticipated.
Other pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Virtual certainty of a contract award is a subjective assessment, but normally arises on appointment as preferred bidder or notification from the prospective customer of their intent to appoint Interserve.
118 INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued m Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
n Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
o Financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade receivables are financial assets and classified as loans and receivables.
Cash and deposits Cash and deposits comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and deposits are financial assets and are classified as loans and receivables.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is taken out and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as, and effective as, hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in the other comprehensive income statement.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the underlying hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
However, when the transaction that is being hedged results in a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of that asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 119 Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
These derivative instruments are designated as fair value through the profit or loss FVTPL.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
p Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The Group issues share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to value the share option plans and the Sharesave Scheme.
A stochastic model has been used to value the Performance Share Plan.
q PFI projects Treatment on consolidation The Groups investments in PFI jointly-controlled entities Joint ventures - PFI Investments are accounted for under the equity method.
Treatment in the underlying joint-venture entity The joint-venture entities have determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.
The balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the entities, and therefore the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to operating revenue by means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the financial asset.
The fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow allocated to the financial asset.
Discount rates are determined using long-term interest rates, subject to a floor, plus risk factors specific to individual projects.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
r Pensions The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff.
For the defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised directly in equity and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
s Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rates at which they are likely to reverse in the tax jurisdiction to which they relate.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient profits in the future to enable the assets to be utilised and reviewed at least annually.
Deferred tax liabilities are normally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is charged credited to the income statement except to the extent that the underlying asset or liability is credited charged to equity in which case the deferred tax follows that treatment to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Basis of preparation and accounting policies continued t Exceptional items Exceptional items are those that the Group consider to be non-recurring and significant in size or in nature.
Exceptional items include: profit on disposals of PFI investments and related costs: and transaction and integration costs relating to the acquisition of businesses.
u Assets classified as held for sale Assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing for use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

Acquisitions The Group made the following acquisitions in the year: On 18 March 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the facilities services business Initial Facilities of Rentokil Initial Plc, for a cash consideration of 245.7 million.
The acquisition strengthens the Support Services offering of Interserve, allowing the provision of a significantly enhanced service offering.
The enlarged business offers a full range of services across all contract sizes and to both publicand private-sector customers.
On 5 December 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of ESG Holdings Limited esg for a cash consideration of 25.7 million.
The acquisition strengthens Interserves position within the UK and Saudi Arabian skills and training markets.
It also provides an increased presence in the Welfare-to-Work market where we are already active via Interserve Working Futures and Rehab Jobfit.
Preliminary fair value exercises have been performed, as set out below: Initial Facilities esg Total Assets acquired million million million Property, plant and equipment 6.6 3.2 9.8 Intangible assets 87.8 19.1 106.9 Cash balances 25.3 4.5 29.8 Inventories 3.3 - 3.3 Trade and other receivables 107.7 5.2 112.9 Trade and other payables 96.8 13.4 110.2 Other liabilities 28.5 4.8 33.3 Net assets 105.4 13.8 119.2 Goodwill 140.3 11.9 152.2 Consideration 245.7 25.7 271.4 Net cash outflow on acquisitions 220.4 21.2 241.6 The fair value adjustments relate to certain intangible assets and their associated deferred tax charge.
These have been separately identified and recognised using appropriate valuation techniques based on the fair value of forecast future cash flows.
The resultant goodwill from the acquisition represents the future economic benefits arising from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised for example the knowledge and expertise of the assembled workforce and the operating synergies that arise from the Groups strengthened market position.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs, included in exceptional costs, amounted to 8.2 million see note 5.
Since acquisition on 18 March 2014, Initial Facilities has contributed 440.4 million to revenue and a 7.9 million loss after exceptional items.
If the business had been acquired on 1 January 2014, it would have contributed revenues of 555.3 million and a loss after exceptional items of 5.6 million.
Since acquisition on 5 December 2014, esg has contributed 3.4 million in revenue and a 0.3 million loss after exceptional items.
If the business had been acquired on 1 January 2014, it would have contributed revenues of 41.2 million and a loss after exceptional items of 3.3 million.
A further 2.1 million of cash was paid in the period relating to the 2013 acquisition of Adyard.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, cash flows, growth rates and margins during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The revenue growth rates are based on current Board-approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of changes in the market.
The Group produces three-year plans and then projects a further year based on growth rates of 2.5%, followed by a terminal value based on a perpetuity calculated at a nominal 2.5% growth which does not exceed current market growth rates.
The rates used to discount the future cash flows range from 8.5% for Support Services 2013: 8.5% to 9.5% for Construction and Equipment Services 2013: 8.5% and are based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
As part of this annual review a sensitivity analysis was performed on the impairment test of each CGU, including an increase in the discount rate of up to 2.0%.

The loan notes attract differing fixed rates of interest depending on their tenor.
This has been swapped to a fixed sterling equivalent of 207.2 million, along with the associated interest payments, with the use of derivatives that have been designated as cash flow hedges that are held at fair value see note 22 b.
The loan notes are in addition to 250 million of committed bank facilities which mature in 2019.
The loan notes are subject to a fixed rate of interest.
The majority of the remainder of the Groups other borrowings bear interest at floating rates which are set according to published LIBOR rates.
The remainder bear interest at rates that are determined by bank base rates.

Financial risk management continued Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into three levels based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, as defined by IFRS 13: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Classification of financial assets liabilities held at fair value according to the definitions set out in IFRS 13: 31 december 31 December 2014 2013 million million Level 2 5.3 0.3 Derivatives used for hedging financial liabilities are considered to be within the grouping referred to as Level 2.
Their fair values are calculated based on the valuation models operated by the relevant counterparty bank, based on market interest rates in force on the date of valuation.
The Level 2 financial derivatives are classified within other receivables and other payables.
No financial instruments have been transferred between Levels during the year.
Exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed by the Groups requirement to trade with counterparties with strong credit ratings as determined by international credit rating agencies.
The transactional banking requirements are met by local banks in each location with significant cash balances being remitted to Group treasury where short-term cash surpluses or cash not available for use by the Group is deposited with investment grade rated banks.
a Currency exposures Where material trade is transacted in non-local currency, the Company hedges the currency exposure and ordinarily this will be achieved with forward contracts.

Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of individual Group companies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage material currency exposures that arise on cash flows from sales or purchases not denominated in functional currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2014.
The Group does not hedge anticipated future sales and purchases.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of foreign operations net assets into the consolidation currency are recognised directly in equity.
The Group does not hedge these translation differences.
The Groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is shown below where a change in value of foreign currencies against sterling would have the following impact on the results of the Group.
A 1% change in exchange rates results in: 31 december 31 December 2014 2013 million million Change in profit 0.3 0.2 Change in reserves net assets 1.6 1.4 A 1% change in the Qatari rial exchange rate would result in a 0.1 million change in profit and a 0.5 million change in reserves net assets.

Financial risk management continued c Market price risk interest rate hedges The Group seeks to control its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to limit the impact on the interest charge in the income statement.
Contracts in place at the year end were as follows: 31 december 2014 31 December 2013 Nominal Nominal value value million Maturity Strike price million Maturity Strike price Interest rate swaps Current 20.0 2015 1.50% Current 20.0 2015 1.50% Current 10.0 2015 1.58% Current 10.0 2015 1.58% The fair value of interest rate hedges at 31 December 2014 is estimated at 0.1 million 2013: 0.3 million.
The fair values of the hedge instruments are calculated using computer valuation models operated by counterparty banks.
No charges have gone through the income statement in the year 2013: nil in respect of changes in the fair value of the hedges.
A gain of 0.2 million 2013: gain of 0.8 million was charged through other comprehensive income in respect to changes in fair value of the hedges.
The use of interest rate caps and swaps, where appropriate, diminishes the impact of an interest rate change.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rate to the Groups results is shown in the table below.
A 1% change in exchange rates results in: 31 december 31 December 2014 2013 million million Change in profit 1.4 0.9 d Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
To manage this risk, credit references are taken and where appropriate parent company guarantees and letters of credit are sought along with monthly monitoring of age and recoverability of trade receivables.
Apart from receivables due from customers related to HM Government, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
e Liquidity risk The Group seeks to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure that it has access to funding to meet current and anticipated future funding requirements determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
The maturity of financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of interest rate hedges above, are discussed in the specific asset and liability footnotes.
f Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst seeking to optimise the debt and equity balance, in order to maximise the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes cash, deposits and borrowings note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The Group has, over recent years, had a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders.
The Group may adjust the capital structure of the Group by returning capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but is subject to covenants in its loan agreements which seek to maintain the level of debt and interest that the Group may take on at serviceable levels by reference to the Groups earnings which ultimately limits the amount of debt that the Group can take on.

Awards were granted during the year as indicated below.
Exercise and vesting details are stated in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 94 to 98.
Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Appropriate provision has been made in these accounts for all material uninsured liabilities resulting from proceedings that are, in the opinion of the directors, likely to materialise.
The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given performance guarantees and provided indemnities to third parties in relation to performance bonds and other contract-related guarantees.
These relate to the Groups own contracts and to the Groups share of the contractual obligations of certain joint ventures and associated undertakings.

The Group engaged external consultants to calculate the fair value of these awards at the date of grant.
The valuation model used to calculate the fair value of the awards granted under this plan was a stochastic valuation model, the inputs of which are detailed below: 2014 2013 2012 grants grants grants Weighted average share price 694.0p 466.1p 275.8p Weighted average exercise price 0p 0p 0p Expected volatility 23.1% 26.4% 33.0% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate 1.1% 0.3% 0.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Average fair value of award per share 462.5p 348.6p 220.0p c Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme is an all-employee HMRC-approved share scheme.
The scheme involves employees saving a set amount from their salary for a period of three years.
At the end of the three-year period the employee is offered the opportunity to purchase shares based on the amount saved at an option price set at the start of the period.
The option price for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 grants was set at a 20% discount of the average share price over five days trading prior to the offer date of the scheme.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Defined benefit retirement schemes The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits.
For each of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2014.
As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Group contributes to various defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
By far the most significant arrangement is the Interserve Pension Scheme in the UK, where benefits are generally related to service and final salary.
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for new hires, with membership of the defined benefit arrangements only permitted when specific contract terms require defined benefit provision.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangements are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to profit and loss.
The current funding target for the Groups defined benefit schemes is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits based on projected salaries where relevant.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 147 The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The assumptions shown are in relation to the Interserve Pension Scheme, which represents 92% of the total defined benefit obligation.
The life expectancy assumptions shown relate to the vast majority of the membership of that scheme.
Alternative assumptions have been used for the less material arrangements where the specific nature of those schemes deems it appropriate to do so.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments for the schemes is around 17 years.

In practice any movement in assumptions is likely to be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts above.

As a result of this investment the Group has additional exposure to 109.4 million of equity performance as at 31 December 2014 2013: 99.5 million.
Around 70% of the Groups direct equity investments are in relation to UK equities 2013: 81%.
Holdings in Government bonds are predominantly index-linked.
Alternative investments include diversified growth funds, fund of hedge funds and emerging market multi-asset funds primarily unquoted.
During 2014 the Trustee of the Interserve Pension Scheme entered a buy-in contract to insure some of the benefits of a subset of the pension membership of the Scheme.
The policy has been valued as the replacement cost at the accounting date, as provided by the insurer, with the exception of a proportion of the policy around 3% which precisely matches the corresponding member benefits.
This small matching element has been valued at the same amount as the defined benefit obligation in respect of the matched benefits.
Overall, this buy-in contract protects the Group from risks associated with approximately 35% of the Schemes defined benefit obligation.
The infrastructure holding is predominantly the portfolio of PFI investments transferred by Interserve Plc to the Interserve Pension Scheme in November 2009 and January 2013.
The schemes have not directly invested in any of the Groups other financial instruments nor in other assets or properties used by the Group.

This includes deficit contributions to the Interserve Pension Scheme of 12.9 million.
The Group has assessed that no further liability arises under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 - The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction on the basis that the scheme rules allow the Company an unconditional right to refunds assuming the gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time until all members have left the scheme.
