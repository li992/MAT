It also includes an impairment charge of $138m against Bydureon, following revised estimates for future sales performance below AstraZenecas commercial expectations at the time of entering into our collaboration with BMS on Amylin products in 2012, and an impairment charge of $136m following AstraZenecas decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
Research and development in 2012 includes a $50m impairment following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214.
Selling, general and administrative costs In 2014, selling, general and administrative costs includes a $529m charge resulting from changes in the fair value of the liabilities for contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance with BMS.
The uplift in fair value reflects increased estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, increased estimates for future royalties payable.
In July 2014, the US Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations that affected how the annual Branded Pharmaceutical Fee the Fee, imposed by the health care reform legislation in 2010 is recognised.
As a result, entities covered by the legislation now accrue for the obligation as each sale occurs.
AstraZeneca recorded a catch-up charge of $226m in 2014 to reflect this new basis, $113m of which has been recorded in selling, general and administrative costs and $113m as a deduction from revenue.
In 2013, selling, general and administrative costs includes an intangible asset impairment charge of $1,620m against Bydureon following revised estimates for future sales performance as detailed above.
Selling, general and administrative costs in 2012 includes net legal provisions of $72m, in respect of net legal provision charges relating to ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale Price litigation in the US, the Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation and Nexium commercial litigation.
The current status of these matters is described in Note 27.
These provisions constituted our best estimate at that time of losses expected for these matters.

Excluding these items, the reported tax rate for the year was 18.2%.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements.
The 2014 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a reduction in provisions for tax contingencies, including a benefit of $117m arising from the inter-governmental agreement of a transfer pricing matter, partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2013 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2012 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $259m arising from a number of tax settlements including settlement of a transfer pricing matter, partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.

To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $6,128m at 31 December 2014 2013: $6,196m: 2012: $8,655m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
In 2013, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 20% by 2015.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 27.
Tax reconciliation to UK statutory rate The table below reconciles the UK statutory tax charge to the Groups total tax charge.

2 Other items include the impact of internal transfers of intellectual property including recognition of deferred tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination tax charge of $304m, and the release of certain tax contingencies following the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations tax credits of $297m.
146 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 4 Taxation continued AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK.
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Groups overall tax charge is noted above.
Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant that expires in 2016.

6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
Our biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
We do not manage these individual functional areas separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
We consider that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises nine Executive VicePresidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International, GPPS, Operations & Information Services, and Human Resources.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.
Geographic areas The following tables show information by geographic area and, for revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets, and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.
Intra-Group pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
2 Included in Assets acquired are those assets that are expected to be used during more than one period property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.
3 Net operating assets exclude short-term investments, cash, short-term borrowings, loans, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations and non-operating receivables and payables.
4 Assets acquired in 2012 include those related to Amylin and Ardea.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2014, 2013 and 2012 to reflect the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 2013: 10%: 2012: 10%.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2014 and 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

Impairment charges and reversals In 2014, impairment charges relate to the termination, or reassessment of the likelihood of success, of several individual projects, none of which had significant capitalised values.
In 2013, AstraZeneca commenced enrolment of the first patient in the first of several Phase III clinical programmes for Lynparza olaparib.
As a result of the initiation of this programme, an impairment charge of $285m, taken in 2011, was reversed and the full historic carrying value of the asset restored to our balance sheet.
There are several indications currently under development for Lynparza olaparib and, at the date of the reversal of the impairment, the recoverable value of the intangible asset relating to Lynparza olaparib determined using value in use calculations as detailed below, was estimated to be at least $650m above its carrying value.
The 2013 impairment charge of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $1,758m against the intangible asset for Bydureon, acquired as part of the 2012 collaboration with BMS on Amylin products, following revised estimates for future sales performance as part of the annual budgeting process that are below AstraZenecas commercial expectations at that time of entering into the collaboration.
Impairment charges also include $136m following AstraZenecas decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
The 2012 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $50m following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214 with a partial impairment of $150m having been taken in the prior year, 2011, based on the final results of Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant treatment.
The remaining $149m charge in 2012 relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected post-tax cash flows over aperiod reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
By their nature, the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates.
The estimated recoverable amount of the acquired and in development assets exceeded their respective calculated value in use.
Consistent with prior years, as part of the impairment review process, management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions including the likelihood of achieving successful trial results and obtaining regulatory approval for in development assets, the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing for launched products, may cause the carrying amount of the intangible assets to exceed the recoverable amount.
In addition, there is a significant risk that partial impairments recognised may be subject to adjustments in future periods.
Any resulting adjustments may be material.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2014, 2013 and 2012 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% 2013: 13%: 2012: 14%.

3 Assets in development are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment.
Arrangements with Merck In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co. Inc. now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co. Inc. that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough Merck for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products in the US.
In 1998, this joint venture was restructured the Restructuring.
Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring the Agreements, a US limited partnership the Partnership was formed, in which Merck was the limited partner and AstraZeneca the general partner, and AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint ventures business subject to certain limited partner and other rights held by Merck and its affiliates.
These rights provided Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and placed limitations on AstraZenecas commercial freedom to operate.
The Agreements provided in part, for annual contingent payments termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZenecas products and activities in stages, some of which are mandatory and others optional.
The termination arrangements and payments included the Advance Payment the Partial Retirement the True-Up the Loan Note Receivable the First Option the Second Option.
AstraZeneca considered that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Mercks interests in the Partnership and Agreement products including Mercks rights to contingent payments.
Once all payments were made, AstraZeneca would have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market.
AstraZeneca benefits under the termination arrangements from: The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999: and Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched for example, Prilosec, Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand and those that are in development.
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased freedom to operate.
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed.
Annual Contingent Payments Following the exercise of the Second Option as detailed below all contingent payments to Merck have now ceased.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 155 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued Advance Payment The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements.
Merck relinquished all rights, including contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger.
As a result, AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of those products including annual contingent payments, affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit.
At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made.
The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset and is being amortised over 20 years.
Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years is used to reflect the typical timescale of development and marketing of a product.
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, the True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in certain AstraZeneca products including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL, AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products and AstraZeneca obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory Therapy Area.
Intangible assets of $994m were recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment $1,656m representing payments on account for future product rights associated with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below.
These non-refundable deposits were classified as intangible assets.
First Option On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option.
Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in products covered by the First Option, including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain products in development at the time principally Brilinta and lesogaberan: development of lesogaberan was subsequently discontinued.
Also on 30 April 2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
These rights were valued at $1,829m and were recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 $1,182m having been transferred from non-refundable deposits to supplement the payment of $647m to Merck.
Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
The remaining non-refundable deposits of $474m relate to benefits that were secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option, as detailed below.
Second Option The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Mercks interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the limited partner and other rights referred to above.
Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Mercks interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US.
This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount.
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option.
The principal areas covered by the amendments were a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price.
Under the amended Agreements, Merck granted to AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with closing on30 June 2014.
Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fell below a minimum amount also remained available to AstraZeneca.
In addition to this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck also reached agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise.
On 30 June 2014, the Second Option was consummated, resulting in i the termination of Mercks interests in entities that hold the US rights to Nexium and Prilosec, and ii the control of these entities by AstraZeneca.
At closing, AstraZeneca paid to Merck a total exercise price of $409m, $327m of which was fixed in 2012 based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for sales of Nexium and Prilosec in the US market.
This amount is subject to a true-up in 2018 that replaces the shared forecast with actual sales for the period from closing in 2014 to June 2018.
At closing, AstraZeneca also paid to Merck an administrative fee of $10m.
In 2018, Merck will receive an additional administrative fee of $11m.
The intangible assets arising from the Second Option, and the $474m from the First Option detailed above, in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from contingent payments.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows.

2 Instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss include the US dollar 7% guaranteed debentures repayable in 2023.
3 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,453m 2013: $1,608m: 2012: $1,551m held at amortised cost.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
160 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 17 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued A loss of $1m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk.
A gain of $38m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $288m.

20 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
162 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Financing Principles 97% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2014 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present, this puts a different, lower value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees UK The UK Pension Fund is managed by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Directors are composed of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
On a triennial basis the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
The last funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2013.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to a separate account which will be held outside the UK Pension Fund.
The assets held in this account will be payable to the AstraZeneca Pension Fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
At 31 December 2014, 501m $775m of assets held in this separate account are included within other investments see Note 11.
The structure of this separate account has changed during the year from a tripartite Escrow arrangement between AstraZeneca, the Pension Fund Trustee and JPMorgan to a custody account held by AstraZeneca with HSBC.
There is a charge in favour of the Pension Fund Trustee over the assets held in this custody account.
Under the current funding plan, a lump sum contribution of 196m $305m was made towards the deficit in January 2015.
This contribution was made by transferring assets from the custody account described above.
The Company and the UK Pension Fund are currently exploring revised funding plans and extended target dates for full funding.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.55% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.2% per annum and investment returns at 4.86% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 4,887m $7,603m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2013 of 4,394m $6,836m.
Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Regulation UK The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 163 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2014 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 92% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside the UK.
The US and Sweden pension funds are managed by fiduciary bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014, when plan obligations were $1,990m and plan assets were $1,725m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014, when plan obligations were estimated toamount to $1,889m and plan assets were $1,178m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014.
In accordance with practice in Germany, the plan has a low level of funding: plan obligations amounted to $413m and plan assets were $21m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions during the year ending 31 December 2015 to the four main countries will be $435m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2014, some 3,616 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 9,680 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2014 was $20m 2013: $16m: 2012: $16m.
Plan assets were $306m and plan obligations were $402m at 31 December 2014.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2014.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows.
2014 2013 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.0% 3.5% 2.2% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.2% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% 0.8% 3.3% 1.1% Discount rate 3.5% 3.0% 4.5% 4.3% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2014 and members expected to retire in 2034 2013: 2013 and 2033 respectively.

the DBO will also increase the value of the bond assets.
This interest rate hedge is further extended by the use of interest rate swaps, so that overall the UK Pension Fund liabilities are around 40% hedged against falling interest rates on an economic value basis.
Note that there are some differences in the credit quality of bonds held by the UK Pension Fund and the bonds analysed to decide the DBO discount rate, such that there remains some risk should yields on different quality bond swap assets diverge.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with The UK Pension Fund holds some inflation-linked assets price inflation specifically inflation in the UK Retail Price which provide a hedge against higher-than-expected inflation Index and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities increases on the DBO.

A one year increase in life expectancy will result in $269m increase in pension fund assets.
Other risks There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits and legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 167 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Rate sensitivities The following table shows the US dollar effect of a change in the significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the retirement benefits obligations in our four main defined benefit pension obligation countries.
2 Of the $318m increase, $269m is covered by the longevity swap.
3 Of the $324m decrease, $280m is covered by the longevity swap.
The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.
The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption has been estimated based on the distribution of the plan cash flows.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 169 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations 2014 Acquisitions BMSs share of Global Diabetes Alliance Assets On 1 February 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Bristol-Myers Squibbs BMS interests in the companies diabetes alliance.
The acquisition provides AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of the diabetes business, which includes Onglyza saxagliptin, Kombiglyze XR saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended release, Komboglyze saxagliptin and metformin HCl, Farxiga dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US, Byetta exenatide, Bydureon exenatide extended release for injectable suspension, Myalept metreleptin and Symlin pramlintide acetate.
The transaction consolidates worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in emerging markets.
The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga, including associated BMS employees.
This combination of intangible product rights and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, requires that the acquisition is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1 February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable for future regulatory, launch and sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca has also agreed to pay various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025.
The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated.
The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales.
AstraZeneca also agreed to make payments up to $225m when certain additional assets are transferred.
Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the fair value of contingent consideration, including future royalties, is recognised immediately as a liability.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca has entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and supply chain of the full portfolio of diabetes products.
BMS will also continue to deliver specified clinical trials in line with the ongoing clinical trial plan, with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress the diabetes portfolio and support the transition for these areas.
These arrangements will continue to be carried out over future periods and future payments by AstraZeneca to BMS in relation to these arrangements will be expensed as incurred.
No amounts have been recognised in the initial acquisition accounting in relation to these arrangements but have been separated, at fair value, from the business combination accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.
The terms of the agreement partially reflect settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and Farxiga collaboration agreements, which have been terminated in relation to the acquisition.
The expected value of those pre-existing milestones is $0.3bn and has been recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination accounting in accordance with IFRS 3.
Subsequently, these separate intangible assets have been recognised.
Goodwill of $1,530m arising on the transaction is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these are the synergies AstraZeneca expect to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the incremental value accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance.
Goodwill of $1.5bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximates the gross contractual amounts receivable.
There are no significant amounts which are not expected to be collected.
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance have been consolidated into the Companys results from 1 February 2014, which have added revenue of $895m in the period to 31 December 2014.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the diabetes alliance, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the additional acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,174m.
As detailed above, it is impracticable to disclose a pro forma profit after tax.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
170 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations continued Almirall On 31 October 2014, the Group completed the agreement with Almirall to transfer the rights to Almiralls respiratory franchise to AstraZeneca.
The transaction provides AstraZeneca with 100% of the rights for the development and commercialisation of Almiralls existing proprietary respiratory business, including rights to revenues from Almiralls existing partnerships, as well as its pipeline of investigational novel therapies.
The franchise includes Eklira aclidinium : Duaklir Genuair, the combination of aclidinium with formoterol which had been filed for registration in the EU and is being developed in the US EU approval received in November 2014 : LAS100977 abediterol, a once daily long-acting betaagonist LABA in Phase II: an M3 antagonist betaagonist MABA platform in pre-clinical development LAS191351, LAS194871 and 2 2 Phase I LAS190792 : and multiple pre-clinical programmes.
Almirall Sofotec, an Almirall subsidiary focused on the development of innovative proprietary devices, has also transferred to AstraZeneca.
In addition, Almirall employees dedicated to the respiratory business, including Almirall Sofotec employees, have transferred to AstraZeneca.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $878m was paid in November, with further payments of up to $1.22bn being payable for future development, launch, and sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca has also agreed to make various sales-related payments.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pounds sterling functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge.
Almiralls pipeline of novel respiratory assets and its device capabilities further strengthen AstraZenecas respiratory portfolio, which includes Symbicort and Pulmicort, as well as the companys investigational medicines in development.
The addition of aclidinium and the combination of aclidinium with formoterol, both in proprietary Genuair device, will allow AstraZeneca to offer patients a choice between dry powder inhaler and metered dose inhaler devices across a range of molecules and combinations.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the selling and marketing operations, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill of $311m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to the significant competitive advantage associated with AstraZenecas complementary portfolio and that attributable to a highly skilled workforce.
Goodwill of $0.3bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Almiralls respiratory franchise results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 31 October 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2014, Almiralls respiratory franchise revenues were $13m.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the respiratory franchise, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,198m.
Definiens On 25 November 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Definiens Group.
Definiens is a privately-held German company focused on imaging and data analysis technology, known as Tissue Phenomics, which dramatically improves the identification of biomarkers in tumour tissue.
Definiens technology provides detailed cell-by-cell readouts from target structures on tissue slides and allows the correlation of this information with data derived from other sources, generating new knowledge and supporting better decisions in research, diagnostics and therapy.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Definiens shares for an upfront consideration of $150m and contingent consideration of up to $150m based on reaching three predetermined development milestones.
Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pound sterling functional currency subsidiary.
Definiens results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 25 November 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2014, Definiens revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenues, and its loss after tax was immaterial.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 171 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations continued If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been unchanged and the change in profit after tax would have been immaterial.

2013 acquisitions Pearl Therapeutics On 27 June 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics.
Pearl Therapeutics is based in Redwood City, California, and is focused on the development of inhaled small molecule therapeutics for respiratory disease.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Pearl Therapeutics shares for an upfront consideration of $569m.
In addition, consideration of up to $450m is payable if specified development and regulatory milestones in respect of any triple combination therapies and selected future products that AstraZeneca develops using Pearl Therapeutics technology platform are achieved.
Sales-related payments of up to a further $140m are payable if pre-agreed cumulative sales thresholds are exceeded.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
Goodwill of $44m was recorded for the acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the synergistic benefit generated by acquiring Pearl Therapeutics workforce, whose skills and knowhow are critical to the best and most efficient completion of the ongoing development programmes.
Pearl Therapeutics results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 27 June 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2013, Pearl Therapeutics revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $49m.
Omthera Pharmaceuticals On 18 July 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Omthera is a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Princeton, New Jersey, focused on the development and commercialisation of new therapies for abnormal levels oflipids in the blood, referred to as dyslipidaemia.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Omtheras shares for an upfront consideration of $323m with up to $120m in future development and approval milestones.
Omtheras results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 18 July 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2013, Omtheras revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $10m.
Amplimmune On 4 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Amplimmune, a privately-held, Maryland, US-based biologics company focused on developing novel therapeutics in cancer immunology.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Amplimmunes shares for an initial consideration of $225m and deferred consideration of up to $275m based on reaching predetermined development milestones.
The acquisition bolsters AstraZenecas oncology pipeline by obtaining multiple early-stage assets for its immune-mediated cancer therapy IMT-C portfolio, including AMP-514, an anti-programmed cell death 1 PD-1 monoclonal antibody MAb.
Other Amplimmune assets include multiple preclinical molecules targeting the B7 pathways.
172 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 24 Acquisitions of business operations continued Goodwill of $33m arising on the acquisition is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified, but include Amplimmunes very early programmes of potential interest for oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, as well as research tools and animal models.
Amplimmunes results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 4 October 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Amplimmunes revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $5m.
Spirogen On 15 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Spirogen, a privately-held biotech company focused on antibody drug conjugate technology for use in oncology.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Spirogens shares for an initial consideration of $200m and deferred consideration of up to $240m based on reaching predetermined development milestones.
Existing out-licensing agreements and associated revenue streams are excluded from this acquisition.
AstraZeneca has also entered into a collaboration agreement with ADC Therapeutics to jointly develop two of ADC Therapeutics antibodydrug conjugate programmes in preclinical development.
AstraZeneca has also made an equity investment in ADC Therapeutics, which has an existing licensing agreement with Spirogen.
Spirogens results have been consolidated into the Companys results from 15 October 2013.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2013, Spirogens revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was immaterial.

This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2013 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
2012 acquisitions Ardea On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea.
Ardea is a US San Diego, California based biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardeas shares for cash consideration of $1,268m.
The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity Therapy Area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill.
In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a highly-skilled workforce and established experience in the field of gout.

For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012, Ardeas revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $43m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1 January 2012, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2012 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $6,245m.

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, currency options, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 22, debt Note 17 and cash Note 16.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables.
These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net funds position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has decreased from a net funds position of $39m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $3,223m at 31 December 2014, primarily as a result of increased outflows from investing activities, including acquisitions.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moodys and A-1 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A2 stable outlook by Moodys and AAnegative outlook by Standard and Poors.
174 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $6,360m, fixed deposits of $20m, less overdrafts of $196m at 31 December 2014, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2014, the Group has issued $2,354m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $6,895m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3bn mature in April 2019 and were undrawn at 31 December 2014.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $6,899m of contingent consideration held within other payables at fair value see Note 18.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 175 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2014, 2013 or 2012.
At 31 December 2014, swaps with a notional value of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 138.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2014, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2014 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pound sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2014, 5.0% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pound sterling and 16.7% of interestbearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
In 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
During 2013, the Group entered into an additional cross-currency swap to convert the remaining un-hedged $250m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
Both these instruments were designated in net investment hedges against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Japanese yen net assets.
In 2014, $125m of the second Japanese yen cross-currency swap was fide-designated from the net investment hedge in order to maintain hedge effectiveness.
Also in 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $151m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2018.
Thisinstrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Chinese renminbi net assets.
Fairvalue movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
176 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk arises where the Group has intercompany funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls.
The most significant risk in this respect is Venezuela, where the Group has approximately $108m equivalent of local currency cash, on which there have been delays in obtaining approval for remittance outside the country.
As a result, the Group is exposed to a potential income statement devaluation loss on its total intercompany balances with the subsidiary in Venezuela, which amounted to approximately $139m as at 31 December 2014.
For the period to 31 December 2014, the Group used the official exchange rate as published by CENCOEX the National Foreign Trade Center of VEF 6.3 $.
However, effective from 31 December 2014, the Group used the SICAD Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System rate of VEF 12 $ for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries.
The Group believes that the SICAD rate represents the most appropriate rate for consolidation as it reflects their best expectation of the rate at which profits will be remitted.
Factors such as future uncertainty and significant delays experienced in remitting cash at the official rate of 6.3 VEF $, as well as management actions in dealing with the Government to settle a portion of the overdue receivables at the SICAD rate of 12 VEF $ were taken into account.
The 12 VEF $ exchange rate has been used in stating equivalent US dollar exposures above.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pound sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2014, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2014, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $27m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2014, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 177 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes anallowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75% of US sales 2013: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 77%: 2012: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2014 2013 2012 $m $m $m Not past due 4,316 5,059 5,322 Past due 0-90 days 354 330 288 Past due 90-180 days 75 78 41 Past due 180 days 17 47 45 4,762 5,514 5,696 2014 2013 2012 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables At 1 January 64 64 66 Income statement credit 2 5 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 8 5 2 At 31 December 54 64 64 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2014 was $5,475m invested in six AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had investments of $300m 2013: nil: 2012: nil in short-term repurchase agreements, which are fully collateralised investments.
In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group and would be readily convertible to cash.
The value of the collateral held at 31 December 2014 was $316m 2013: nil: 2012: nil.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2014 was $457m 2013: $326m: 2012: $230m.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and marketrelated packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,800 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
TheRemuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 88 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.

The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years.
Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the Company.
The first grant of awards was made in June 2005.
The main grant of awards in 2014 under the plan was in March, with a further, smaller grant in February.
Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
For awards to all participants in 2014, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
The grant of awards in March 2014 was the final grant under this plan.
The plan has been replaced by the AstraZeneca 2014 Performance Share Plan.
Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report from page 100.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenuerelated milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Risk section from page 203, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Groups research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2012, 2013 or 2014.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc. and or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties PRPs or defendants at approximately 17 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes together, US Environmental Consequences.
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC SMC, which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 30 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.
AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US.
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Groups business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2014 in the aggregate of $84m 2013: $87m: 2012: $88m, mainly relating to the US.
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation.
Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
