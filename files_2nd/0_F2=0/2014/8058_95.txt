Provisions for liabilities and charges Accounting policy Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that there will be an outflow of resources to settle that obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect the latest assumptions.
The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows resulting from the realization of those risks could differ from the Companys estimates.
