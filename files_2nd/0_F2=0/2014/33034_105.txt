184 Additional information Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an nadjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specic items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not dened under IFRS and are therefore termed nnon-GAAP measures.
The{non-GAAP measures we use are the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit, as well as in underlying operating costs excluding transit, the investment in BT Sport and the non-cash increase in the pensions operating charge reported and adjusted EBITDA reported and normalised free cash ow and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specic items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specic items.
Specic items are those that in managements judgement need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their si]e, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specic, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups underlying financial performance.
Items which have been considered to be specic items by virtue of their si]e, nature or incidence include disposals of businesses and{investments, regulatory settlements, historic insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
Specic items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and operating costs Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs are measures which seek to reect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specic items.
We focus on the trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, as transit trac is low-margin and is{signicantly aected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the increase in reported revenue and decrease in reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the increase in underlying revenue and increase in underlying operating costs excluding transit, is set out below.

Additional information 185 EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
EBITDA is dened as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is dened as EBITDA before specic items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash ow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Within the lines of business we may also consider our performance using an underlying EBITDA measure, which additionally excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals and foreign exchange.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
A{reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Earnings per share We also measure financial performance based on adjusted earnings per share, which excludes specic items.
Basic and adjusted earnings per share, and the per share impact of specic items, are as follows 2013 2012 a a 2014 Restated Restated Pence Pence Pence Year ended 31 March per share m per share m per share m b Basic earnings per share profit 25.7 2,016 24.8 1,946 22.6 1,755 c Specic items 2.5 196 1.5 111 0.8 59 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 28.2 2,212 26.3 2,057 23.4 1,814 a Restated, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

c Specic items are set out in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
We disclose reported earnings per share, both basic and diluted, in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Free cash ow Normalised free cash ow is one of the groups key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Normalised free cash ow is dened as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less cash ows from nancing activities except net interest paid the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings the net sale of short-term investments and excluding the cash impact of specic items purchases of{telecommunications licences and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.
Normalised free cash ow is primarily a liquidity measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and nancing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outows associated with investing in our infrastructure and nancing our operations.
In addition, normalised free cash ow excludes cash ows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals and repayment and raising of debt.
Normalised free cash ow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.
Our key free cash ow measure changed from adjusted free cash ow to normalised free cash ow in 2012 13 following the 2.0bn lump sum pension deficit payment made in March 2012.
The 520m tax credit relating to this deficit payment would have distorted our free cash ow measure in 2012 13, as would the 202m payment for the 4G spectrum licence.
Certain historical incentive share awards still use adjusted free cash ow as one of the performance criteria for vesting.
Adjusted free cash ow does not exclude purchases of telecommunications licences and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
Additional information 186 Additional information A reconciliation from net cash inow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported, adjusted and normalised free cash ow, is set out below.

Loans and other borrowings are measured as the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Our net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash ows that should arise when our financial instruments mature.
We adjust these cash ows to reect hedged risks that are re-measured under fair value hedges, as well as for the impact of the eective interest method.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
Net debt is a measure of the groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and indebtedness.
There are material limitations in the use of alternative performance measures and the use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from these to net debt is given below.
