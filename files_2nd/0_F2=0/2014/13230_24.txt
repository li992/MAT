Authorisation of financial statements The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 3 March 2015 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominique Yates.
Regus plc S. A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Regus plc S. A. owns a network of business centres which are leased to a variety of business customers.
Information on the Groups structure is provided in note 31, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 30.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs.
The Company prepares its parent Company annual accounts in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP: extracts from these are presented on pages 90 and 91.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities.
The extract from the parent Company annual accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC with an effective date from 1 January 2014 did not have a material effect on the Group financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards were adopted by the Group for periods commencing on 1 January 2014: IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments to IAS 19 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Revised and subsequent amendments IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Revised IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IAS 36 Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and subsequent amendments IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and subsequent amendments IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and subsequent amendments IFRIC 21 Levies Various Annual Improvements 2010 2012 Cycle Various Annual Improvements 2011 2013 Cycle Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 32.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as described in note 23.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 50 to 89.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 11 to 13 as well as the Groups principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 20 to 23.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 73.
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is Regus plcs functional currency, and all values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or the associate qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.

Accounting policies continued When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group.
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date.
The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value.
The effect of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc.
At the date of the transaction, Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group plc.
Consequently, no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
IFRSs not yet effective The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements as they are effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 or have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements: IAS 16 Revaluation method proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation Amendments to IAS 16 1 January 2016 IAS 38 Revaluation method proportionate restatement of accumulated amortisation Amendments to IAS 38 1 January 2016 IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IFRS 11 1 January 2016 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early adoption and relevant to the Group.
The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become effective and or endorsed by the European Union, whichever is later.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2014.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its nonfinancial assets to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any indicator is identified, then the assets recoverable amount is re-evaluated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Positive goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Groups transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the requirements of IFRS.
56 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 56 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Strategic report Governance Financial statements Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Brand Regus brand Indefinite life Brand Other acquired brands 20 years Computer software 5 years Customer lists 2 years Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result.
Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value of the identified assets and its fair value less cost to sell.
Leases Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
All other leases, including all of the Groups property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors, net of any future finance charges.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating leases Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments.
The commencement of the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments.
Contingent rentals are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Buildings 50 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Furniture 10 years Office equipment and telephones 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Revenue Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding sales taxes.
Where rent free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the customer contract.
Workstations Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered.
Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income Service income including the rental of meeting rooms is recognised as services are rendered.
In circumstances where Regus acts as an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered.
Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.

Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
