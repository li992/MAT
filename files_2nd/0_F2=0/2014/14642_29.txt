Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Spire Healthcare Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively, the Group owns and operates private hospitals and clinics in the UK and provides a range of private healthcare services.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 23 March 2015.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK registered number: 9084066.
The address of its registered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London, EC4Y 8EN.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
GROUP REORGANISATION DURING 2014 Spire Healthcare Group Limited was incorporated on 12 June 2014 and was subsequently re-registered as a public company on 23 June 2014 with the name Spire Healthcare Group plc.
With effect from 18 July 2014, the Company became the legal parent of Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited and their respective subsidiary undertakings.
The Group was admitted to the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange on 23 July 2014 the Admission.
These companies were under common management and control throughout the years presented and, therefore, these financial statements have been prepared as if the reorganisation had taken place as at the beginning of the earliest year presented herein.
The comparative financial statements comprised Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited, together with each of their subsidiaries, as included in note 18, and, until 17 January 2013, the comparative financial statements also included Spire UK Holdco 1A Limited, Spire UK Holdco 3A Limited and their subsidiaries.
As the group reorganisation did not lead to a change in control of the companies included in the Group, it has been accounted for using the pooling-of-interest method by aggregating the assets, liabilities, results, share capital and reserves, after eliminating intercompany balances and unrealised profits.
The financial information, therefore, reflects the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the components of the Group that constituted the property ownership and trading businesses.
Transactions with Cinven Funds the controlling party until Admission on 23 July 2014 and other entities under common control that were not acquired and, therefore, are not part of the Group, are disclosed as transactions with related parties see note 33 for further information on related party transactions.
GOING CONCERN On Admission on 23 July 2014, the Group refinanced its bank loan facilities with a facility that matures in 2019.
The proceeds from the issue of new ordinary shares, existing resources and 425.0 million from the new term loans, were applied in the repayment of all of the existing bank loan and interest rate swap liabilities.
Loans from former parent undertakings were settled through the issue of new shares in the Company.
The directors have considered the Groups forecasts and projections, and the risks associated with their delivery, and are satisfied that, the Group will be able to operate within the covenants imposed by the new bank loan facility for the foreseeable future.
In relation to available cash resources, the directors have had regard to both cash at bank and a 100.0 million committed undrawn revolving credit facility.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED The principal accounting policies adopted are described below and were consistently applied for all periods presented, except as noted below.
Revenue recognition The Group derives its revenue primarily from providing private health care services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK.
Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided.
Interest income Interest is recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of clinical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, consumables and prostheses.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Other operating costs Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with properties leased under operating leases, depreciation, maintenance and running costs of properties and equipment.
It also includes administrative expenses, including the provision of central support services, IT and other administrative costs.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging exceptional items, as defined below.
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude exceptional items to calculate the Key Performance Indicator Operating profit before exceptional items, which is utilised in measuring performance before the impact of non-recurring, exceptional items in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Consolidation The results of all subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are brought into the accounts from the date of purchase, being the date on which the Group obtains control.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included in the accounts until the date of disposal or the Groups control ceases.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Business combination and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating costs.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there is an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or properties under construction.
Other assets are depreciated so as to write off the carrying amounts of the assets over their expected useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings and improvements 5-50 years Leasehold buildings and improvements lower of unexpired lease term or expected life, with a maximum of 35 years Plant and machinery 5-10 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3-10 years The expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and revised as appropriate.
The review of the asset lives and residual values of properties takes into consideration the plans of the business and levels of expenditure incurred on an ongoing basis to maintain the properties in a fit and proper state for their ongoing use as hospitals and the forecast timing of disposal.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 103 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an average basis.
Net realisable value means estimated selling price, less trade discounts, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Pensions The Group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Other employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
Where the share awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Black Scholes valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
Where the share awards have total shareholder return TSR market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values see note 28.
The resulting fair values are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
At the end of each year, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered to be an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Leases Leasing arrangements which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in tangible assets and depreciated over their estimated economic lives or over the term of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
The capital element of the leasing commitments is included in liabilities as obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligation and the interest element is charged to the income statement in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
104 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Taxation including deferred taxation Total income tax on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable result for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss: and investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used.
Derivative financial instruments The Group may enter into derivative financial instrument arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to such derivatives if the criteria for doing so are met.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium.
Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders in both the Company and the Consolidated balance sheet until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations that are applicable to the Group and are effective from 1 January 2014 and have been applied to these financial statements: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IAS 32 Financial Instruments, Presentation May 2012 annual improvements IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting Amendments to IAS 39 IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 32 These new and amended standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the financial position of the Group, or result in changes in accounting policy or any significant additional disclosure.
There have been other new and amended standards and interpretations issued, or have come into effect, from 1 January 2014: however, they are not applicable to the Group and, hence, not included above.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 105 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET APPLIED The standards and interpretations issued, but only effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2015 or later, which are considered applicable and may have significant impact on the Group financial statements, are disclosed below.
The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting.
Subject to endorsement for use in the European Union, IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted.
Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory.
The impact of the standard on the Groups performance and financial position will be evaluated.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard replaces all existing IFRS standards and interpretations that currently govern revenue recognition under IFRS and provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
It does not apply to insurance contracts, to financial instruments or to lease contracts, which fall within the scope of other IFRSs.
The standard also requires entities to provide users of financial statements with more disclosures.
Subject to endorsement for use in the European Union, IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively, with earlier application permitted.
The impact of the standard on the Groups performance and financial position is being evaluated.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, and estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identified as involving particularly complex judgements or subjective estimates: JUDGEMENTS Deferred tax Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available in future against which they can be utilised.
Future taxable profits are estimated based on business plans which include estimates and assumptions regarding economic growth, interest, inflation rates and taxation rates.
The Group owns a portfolio of freehold and leasehold property interests.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax liability in its financial statements in respect of capital gains tax and other taxes based on the assumption that a proportion of the freehold properties will be disposed of in future years, with the remaining properties being realised through use.
This calculation requires judgement about the timing and number of the related property disposals, which is potentially impacted by changes to plans made by the business over time and, in particular, changes in business plans in respect of the holding or disposing of properties.
Leases In the determination of the classification of a number of leases over hospital properties as operating leases, assumptions have been made about the discount rate applied to the annual rent payable over the remainder of the lease term and of the useful economic life of the hospitals.
Further information about commitments under these leases is given in note 29.
Exceptional items Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional.
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement.
Details of these items categorised as exceptional are outlined in note 8.
ESTIMATES Estimation of useful lives and residual values Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives, taking into account residual values, where appropriate.
The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors.
In re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account.
Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining lives of the assets and projected disposal values.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are set out in note 3.
Goodwill Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
This is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the goodwill with its carrying value in the accounts.
The value-in-use calculations require the Group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions.
The present value of these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.
The assumptions considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 16.
Share-based payments At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

These costs were largely tax deductible.
A deferred tax asset was recognised in relation to the share-based payments.
NON-IPO RELATED In the year ended 31 December 2014, reorganisation and set up costs were mainly associated with the costs of acquisition of St Anthonys Hospital, which as a material acquisition in the current year, has been treated as exceptional.
Regulatory costs include costs relating to the Competition and Markets Authority CMA enquiry and 3.3 million of estimated liabilities payable to third parties, arising from uninsured, or partly uninsured, claims for damages in respect of the supply of medical products and other legal claims made in respect of services previously supplied to patients.
These costs were largely tax deductible except for the costs of acquisition of St Anthonys Hospital.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, reorganisation and set up costs were mainly associated with the dual running IT costs and an onerous lease.
Corporate restructuring and refinancing costs related to advisers fees associated with the sale of twelve property owning companies on 17 January 2013, subject to leases 2013 Freehold Sale, and other refinancing activity.
Regulatory costs mainly comprised the costs of the CMA enquiry.
PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT On 15 August 2014, the Group completed the disposal of the assets of Spire Fertility Disposal Limited formerly London Fertility Centre Limited for a consideration of 3.0 million.

Exceptional finance costs In the year ended 31 December 2013, following the extension of the Groups bank loan facilities, and reflecting the Groups revised strategy for future re-financing, it was determined that the remaining interest rate swap contracts no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting and, therefore, the non-cash fair value of swap losses of 68.8 million, previously accumulated in the hedging reserve, were recycled to the income statement.
Other items arising in the year ended 31 December 2013 include a credit related to the partial waiver of bank debt and interest rate swap liabilities on settlement, net of the unamortised debt costs.
This resulted in a total net credit of 26.6 million.

BUSINESS COMBINATION continued The total consideration of 38.5 million comprised of the following: a cash payment of 38.0 million, which was made in May 2014: and a deferred consideration contingent upon the working capital of the business on completion date.
This amount was determined to be 0.5 million by the parties involved in August 2014 and the amount was settled at that time.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition primarily because of the geographical location of the established hospital, procurement and other synergies, relationships with consultants and other clinical personnel, as well as deferred tax liability recognition on the property.
St Anthonys Hospital contributed revenue of 19.2 million and an operating profit of 0.1 million in the period from the date of acquisition to the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2014, the first day of the financial year, revenue would have been 31.2 million.
Management is not disclosing the profit or loss of the combined entity for the current reporting year due to impracticability, as this disclosure could potentially be misleading and does not reflect the actual results that would have arisen if the hospital had been trading under the ownership of the Spire Group.
St Anthonys Hospital was previously a not-for-profit organisation.
Acquisition costs of 2.0 million have been expensed in the income statement.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS million Goodwill Cost: At 1 January 2013 516.2 Additions in the year At 1 January 2014 516.2 Additions in the year 6.6 Disposal in the year 2.7 At 31 December 2014 520.1 Impairment: At 1 January 2013 0.4 Charge for the year 0.9 At 1 January 2014 1.3 Charge for the year 1.0 Disposal in the year 1.3 At 31 December 2014 1.0 Net book value: At 31 December 2014 519.1 At 31 December 2013 514.9 The goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment or when there is an event that may indicate impairment.
In the year, the Groups goodwill in relation to an investment in a medical practice of 1.0 million was impaired following a CMA Final Order, whereby consultants are allowed to practise wherever they wish.
The prior years impairment of 0.9 million relates to Spire Fertility Disposal Limited formerly London Fertility Centre Limited, a business disposed of by the Group during the year.
The directors do not believe that any further impairment is required in the financial period.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING Goodwill arose principally from separate acquisitions of two hospital businesses: 422.5 million from the acquisition of hospitals from Bupa in 2007: and 82.6 million on the acquisition of the Classic Hospitals Group in 2008.
The balance of 14.0 million arose on subsequent acquisitions.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estimated value in use.
In order to estimate the value-in-use, management have used trading projections covering the four year period to December 2018, which were extended to cover the five year period to December 2019.
112 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 16.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being revenue growth, which is impacted by an interaction of a number of elements of the operating model, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of discharges, assumptions regarding cost inflation and discount rates.
These variables are interdependent and the forecast cash flows reflect managements expectations based on current market trends.
Revenue growth is projected to be in line with past experience and expectations of future performance, averaging 5.9% for the five year period 2013: 6.5%.
Cost assumptions are consistent with the Groups historic track record, after taking account of headline inflation at 3.3% 2013: 3.3%.
A long-term growth rate of 2.25% 2013: 2.25% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2019, which is based on historic growth rates achieved by the sector, which have typically exceeded RPI.
Pre-tax discount rates were based on the capital asset pricing model, utilising a sector specific Beta in arriving at the equity premium and cost of debt based on current bank lending rates.
A specific pre-tax discount rate was calculated to reflect the profile of cash flows inherent to that specific cash-generating unit and this was 10.2% 2013: 10.2%.
The recoverable amount from acquisitions is calculated based on cash flow forecasts that reflect the assumptions stated above.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, an increase of 3% in the pre-tax discount rate to 13.2%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.
Similarly, zero growth in the period beyond 2019, with all other assumptions held constant or combined with a 1% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, did not identify any impairments.
As at the balance sheet date, it is not considered to be reasonably possible that circumstances will change, so that the key assumptions made in assessing the recoverable amount relating to each of the acquisitions will be revised to the point where the goodwill is considered impaired.
On 11 March 2014, the long leasehold interest in the Spire Washington Hospital, with a net book value of 12.3 million, was disposed of.
As at 31 December 2014, included in the net book value of property, plant and equipment above is 29.0 million 2013: 32.5 million relating to assets held under finance leases on which there was a depreciation charge of 1.5 million in the year 2013: 1.2 million.
