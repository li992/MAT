Fees for other assurance services comprise non-statutory assurance work which is customarily performed by the external auditor, including the audit of the Groups MCEV reporting.

In view of the significance and scale of this work, the Audit Committee specifically assessed the suitability of PwC to provide this service.
The 2014 fees for other non-audit services of 1.5 million includes 0.5 million relating to a controls review at Aviva Investors and 1.0 million for a number of other, individually smaller services.

d Tax reconciliation The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate of the home country of the Company as follows: Shareholder Policyholder 2014 Shareholder Policyholder 2013 m m m m m m Total profit before tax 2,339 382 2,721 2,819 191 3,010 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% 503 82 585 656 44 700 Reconciling items Different basis of tax policyholders 302 302 147 147 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior periods 36 36 18 18 Non-assessable income and items not taxed at the full statutory rate 22 22 54 54 Non-taxable loss profit on sale of subsidiaries and associates 31 31 154 154 Disallowable expenses 76 76 98 98 Different local basis of tax on overseas profits 138 2 136 184 184 Change in future local statutory tax rates 17 17 9 9 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 3 3 21 21 Tax effect of profit loss from joint ventures and associates 4 4 10 10 Other 9 9 4 4 Total tax charged to income statement 601 382 983 668 191 859 The tax charge attributable to policyholder returns is removed from the Groups total profit before tax in arriving at the Groups profit before tax attributable to shareholders profits.
As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profit and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Groups pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.
The difference between the policyholder tax charge and the impact of this item in the tax reconciliation can be explained as follows: 2014 2013 m m Tax attributable to policyholder returns 382 191 UK corporation tax at a rate of 21.5% 2013: 23.25% in respect of the policyholder tax deduction 82 44 Different local basis of tax of overseas profits 2 Different basis of tax policyholders per tax reconciliation 302 147 UK legislation was substantively enacted in July 2013 to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014, resulting in an effective rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 21.5%.
A further reduction to 20% was also enacted with effect from 1 April 2015.
The 20% rate has been used in the calculation of the UKs deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2014.
