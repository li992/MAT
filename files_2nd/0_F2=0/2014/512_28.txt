11 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number ofshares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts which are treated as cancelled.
2014 2013 Profit for the year million 215 246 Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue million 261 267 Basic earnings per share pence 82.57 92.15 For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutiveOrdinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The purchase consideration, paid in cash, comprises a fixed element of 4 million and further payments up to a maximum of 2 million dependent on financial performance during 2015.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 5 million Total assets of 5 million and total liabilities of nil resulting in goodwill of 1 million.
GTGL is a leading provider of rental power solutions to customers in the northwest of the UK and this acquisition will help usincrease our presence in the geographical area.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units CGUs as follows: 2014 2013 million million Americas 109 113 Europe, Middle East and Africa 13 12 Asia, Pacific and Australia 8 8 Group 130 133 Local business 128 131 Power Projects 2 2 Group 130 133 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 8.8% after tax 2013: 8.6%, based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Before tax the estimated discount rate was 12.1% 2013: 11.7%.
The WACC was calculated using the market capitalisation basis as at 31 December 2014 i. e. equity valued basis.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using current year cash flows, a prudent view of futuremarket trends and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash flow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0%.
As at 31 December 2014, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs significantly exceeded their net asset value.
The Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment calculations that would give rise to an impairment.

40% of the amounts past due are less than 30 days past due 2013: 43%.
The Group assesses credit quality differently in relation to its two business models as explained below: Local business Our Local business serves customers in North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australasia.
It is a high transaction intensive business focused on frequently occurring events and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business other than in the case of a major event, for example, the London Olympics, which was included in the Europe, Middle East and Africa business in 2012.
Apart from these type of major events there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits arereviewed on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt inthe Local business.
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable as a percentage of total gross debtors was 2% 2013: 1%.
Power Projects Our Power Projects business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Customers are mainly in developing countries and include powerutilities, governments, armed forces, oil companies and mining companies.
In addition the majority of the contracts above are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk profile and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
To date the Group has also had a low level ofbad debt in the Power Projects business although the risk of a major default is high.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2014 for our Power Projects business was 208 million 2013: 196 million.
Within this balance, receivable balances totalling 83 million 2013: 85 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 125million 2013: 111 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.

It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings will qualify for the UK dividend exemption and the Group can control the distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries.
In some countries, local tax ispayable on the remittance of a dividend.
Were dividends to be remitted from these countries, the additional tax payable would be 15 million.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 6 million 2013: 5 million of which 6 million 2013: 5 million relates to carried forward taxlosses as our forecasts indicate that these assets will not reverse in the near future.
Deferred tax assets of 18 million 2013: 13 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current orpreceding period.

This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
CASH FLOW HEDGES Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge is of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction that subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges of transactions that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.

The weighted average interest rate on fixed debt is derived from the fixed leg of each interest rate swap and coupons applying to fixed rate private placement notes.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 64 million 2013: 60 million of borrowings in the above table as fixed rate.

A4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As stated in our accounting policies Note 27.
A1 on page 158 the activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts tohedge these exposures.

i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2014.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Market values have been used to determine fair values.

In accordance with IFRS 13, interest rate swaps are considered to be level 2 with fair value being calculated at the present value of estimated future cash flows using market interest rates.
Forward foreign currency contracts and currency options are considered to be level 1 as the valuation is based on quoted market prices attheend of the reporting period.
Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity ofthese instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of non-current borrowings, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet.

A6 PENSIONS Overseas Pension arrangements for overseas employees vary, and schemes reflect best practice and regulation in each particular country.
The charge against profit is the amount of contributions payable to the defined contribution pension schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The pension cost attributable to overseas employees for 2014 was 9 million 2013: 7 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, defined benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
The Trustee of the Scheme has control over the operation, funding and investment strategy of the Scheme but works closely with the Company toagree funding and investment strategy.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2011 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 4.2% Growth in average pay levels 4.9% Increase in pensions 3.3% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 59 million which was sufficient to cover 78% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
As part of the valuation at 31 December 2011, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
During 2012 the Company contributions for benefits building up in the future were 28.6% of pensionable earnings.
Since 1 February 2013 the Company has paid contributions of 35.9% of pensionable earnings.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company made contributions of0.6 million in January 2012, 3.5 million in December 2012, 2.5 million in January 2013 and 2.0 million in January 2014.
168 Aggreko plc Annual report and accounts 2014 1 2 3 4 27.
A6 PENSIONS CONTINUED The Company plans to make further additional contributions of 1.25 million each year until the year ended 31 December 2018.
Employee contributions are 6% of pensionable earnings.
The Scheme closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
New employees are given the option to join a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 2 million were paid to the scheme during the year 2013: 1 million.
There are no outstanding or prepaid balances at the year end.
An update of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary using the latest available information for the purposes of this statement.
The major assumptions used in this update by the actuary were: 31 Dec 31 Dec 2014 2013 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8% 5.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% 3.5% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.3% 3.7% Discount rate 3.8% 4.5% Inflation assumption 3.3% 3.7% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 24.0 23.9 Women 26.6 26.5 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 26.7 26.6 Women 29.4 29.3 The assets in the Scheme were: Value at Value at Value at 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2014 2013 2012 Equities million million million UK Equities 8 8 12 Overseas Equities 11 10 14 Diversified Growth 7 7 Absolute Return 7 7 Property 1 4 4 Index-linked Bonds 34 22 16 Fixed interest Bonds 5 6 Bonds 16 13 19 Cash 2 1 5 Total 91 78 70 There is a risk of asset volatility leading to a deficit in the Scheme.
Working with the Company, the Trustee has agreed investment derisking triggers which, when certain criteria are met, will decrease corporate bond and fixed interest gilt holdings and increase the holding of index linked bonds.
Over time, this will result in an investment portfolio which better matches the liabilities of the Scheme thereby reducing the risk of asset volatility.
However there remains a significant level of investment mismatch in the Scheme.
This is deliberate and is aimed at maximising the Schemes long-term investment return whilst retaining adequate control of the funding risks.
Aggreko plc Annual report and accounts 2014 169 ACCOUNTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2014 27.
A6 PENSIONS CONTINUED The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 million million million Fair value of assets 91 78 70 Present value of funded obligations 98 84 74 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 7 6 4 An alternative method of valuation is the estimated cost of buying out benefits at 31 December 2014 with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at 31 December 2014 rather than the Company continuing to fundthe ongoing liabilities of the Scheme.
The Company estimates the amount required to settle the Schemes liabilities at 31 December 2014 isaround 150 million which gives a Scheme shortfall on a buyout basis of approximately 59 million.
The components of the defined benefit cost as follows: 2014 2013 million million Current service costs 2 2 Net interest cost Interest expense on liabilities 4 3 Interest income on assets 4 3 Administrative expenses and taxes 2 2 The majority of the 2 million cost was included within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2014 2013 million million Present value of obligation at 1 January 84 74 Service cost 2 2 Interest cost 4 3 Benefits paid 1 1 Remeasurements Effect of changes in demographic assumptions Effect of changes in financial assumptions 9 6 Effect of experience adjustments Present value of obligation at 31 December 98 84 Defined benefit obligation by participant status Actives 49 41 Deferreds 31 27 Pensioners 18 16 98 84 170 Aggreko plc Annual report and accounts 2014 1 2 3 4 27.
A6 PENSIONS CONTINUED The measurement of the defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions as described below: The discount rate has been selected following actuarial advice and taking into account the duration of the liabilities.
A decrease in the discount rate of 0.5% per annum would result in a 15 million increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation liabilities is around 28 years.
The inflation assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, salary increases and deferred revaluations.
An increase in the inflation rate of 0.5% per annum would result in a 15 million increase in the present value ofthe defined benefit obligation.
The longevity assumptions adopted are based on those recommended by the Scheme Actuary advising the Trustee of the Scheme and reflect the most recent mortality information available at the time of the Trustee actuarial valuation.
The increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation due to members living one year longer would be 3 million.
There is a risk that changes in the above assumptions could increase the deficit in the Scheme.
Other assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation are also uncertain, although their effect is less material.
Present value of Scheme assets are as follows: 2014 2013 million million Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 78 70 Interest income 4 3 Employer contributions 4 5 Benefits paid 1 1 Remeasurements return on plan assets excluding interest income 6 1 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 91 78 Analysis of the movement in the balance sheet 2014 2013 million million At 1 January 6 4 Defined benefit cost included in income statement 2 2 Contributions 4 5 Benefits paid Total remeasurements 3 5 At 31 December 7 6 Cumulative actuarial gains and losses recognised in equity 2014 2013 million million At 1 January 35 30 Actuarial losses recognised in the year 3 5 At 31 December 38 35 The actual return on Scheme assets was 11 million 2013: 5 million.
Expected cash flows in future years Expected employer contributions for the year ended 31 December 2015 are 3 million.
Expected total benefit payments: approximately 1 million per year for next 10 years.
