The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that the total dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year.
Transfer to General reserves also includes US$2.5 million of debenture redemption reserve and remeasurement reserve related to net defined benefit liability of US$1.1 million.
3 In December 2012, the Group acquired remaining 49% stake in Western Cluster Limited WCL at a consideration of US$33.5 million.
This resulted in increase in Groups stake in WCL from 51% to 100%.
The increase has been accounted in the financial statements as an equity transaction.
The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in Groups interest in the Net assets of WCL.
4 The merger reserve arose on incorporation of the Company during the year ended 31 March 2004.
The investment in Twin Star had a carrying amount value of US$20.0 million in the accounts of Volcan.
