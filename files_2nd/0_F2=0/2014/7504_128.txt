Customer re-contact programme We have completed the re-contacting of UK customers who may have suffered detriment in the way they bought their policy, and where appropriate, re-imbursed customers.
During the year total expenditure of 23.3m was incurred in running this programme and making customer redress payments.
In November 2013 an additional exceptional charge of 19.0m was made to cover the costs of this programme which were higher than initially expected.
At the end of March 2014 there is 7.2m of the provision remaining.
The provision of 7.2m relates to the finalisation of reimbursement payments to customers who have responded to the re-contact exercise and other costs associated with completing the redress of the UK issues.

Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The operating segment France was formerly known as Domo.
Segment profit loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with head office and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, finance costs, and tax.
This is the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
