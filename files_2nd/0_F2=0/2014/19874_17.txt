UKCPEL owns 3 Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
The Partnership, UKCPH and UCKPEL own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.

CBRE Limited, Chartered Surveyors the Property Valuer completed a valuation of Group investment properties at 31 December 2014 on an open market basis in accordance with the requirements of the Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which is deemed to equate to market value.
The Property Valuer, in valuing the portfolio, is acting independently and external to it.
Market value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amount for which each asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 1,272,315,000 2013 1,048,705,000.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2014 consists of accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 7,084,000 2013 5,978,000 which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
46 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 235200 UKCPT pp44-pp57 21 04 2015 15:22 Page 47 In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2014 is based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation.
The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are to be assessed by reference to estimated rental value.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner however, normal acquisition costs are included in the valuation.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 3 to 7 per cent for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 4 to 7 per cent.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs or maintenance to its investment properties.
The following disclosure is provided in relation to the adoption of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
All properties are deemed Level 3 for the purposes of fair value measurement and the current use of each property is considered the highest and best use.
The fair value of completed investment property is determined using a yield methodology.
Under this method, a propertys fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the assets life including an exit or terminal value.
As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, this method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest.
To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate capitalisation rate is applied to establish the present value of the cash inflows associated with the real property.
The duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment.
The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of property.
In the case of investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, nonrecoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses.
The series of periodic net cash inflows, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted.
Set out below are the valuation techniques used for each property sector plus a description and quantification of the key unobservable inputs relating to each sector.

The bank loan is secured on a proportion of the property portfolio of the Group.
Under bank covenants related to the loan the Company is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 50 per cent this is defined as the ratio of the loan compared to the aggregate of the open market property valuations plus any cash deposits : The qualifying adjusted net rental income for any calculation period any 3 month period is not less than 175 per cent of the projected finance costs for that period: No single tenant accounts for more than 30 per cent of the total net rental income: The five largest tenants do not account for more than 50 per cent of total net rental income: No single property accounts for more than 25 per cent of the gross secured asset value this is defined as the sum of the value of the properties as stated in the latest valuations plus any cash deposits.
The Company met all the covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of two interest rate swap contracts.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swaps with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swaps is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 3.0 per cent per annum on 42.1 million and 2.215 per cent per annum on 37.9 million respectively.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the two interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2014 is 0.8 million 2013: 2.2 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Both swaps are deemed effective for accounting purposes.
Interest is payable by the Company at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the Gross Assets Value, expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage.
Gross Assets Value takes into account the value of the properties and any other assets held by the Company and the Guarantors currently UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UKCPT Limited Partnership as well as unsecured cash.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 5 per cent and does not exceed 10 per cent, the margin is 0.55 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 10 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 0.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 50 per cent, the margin is 0.70 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2014 the applicable margin was 0.60 per cent 2013 0.60 per cent.
ii Barclays Facility The Group also has a seven year 150 million facility, maturing in May 2018, with Barclays Bank plc taken out in May 2011.
As at 31 December 2014 this entire loan was drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on the property portfolio held by UKCPEL.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCPEL is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent Interest cover at the relevant payment date is not less than 160 per cent UKPCEL met all covenant tests during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of three interest rate swap contracts.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had in place interest rate swaps totalling 150 million with Barclays bank plc 2013: 150 million.
All of these interest rate swaps effectively hedged the current drawn down loan with Barclays Bank plc.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 2.9925 per cent per annum on the 100 million swap, 1.2 per cent per annum on the 30 million swap and 1.893 per cent per annum on the 20 million swap.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2014 is 7.5 million 2013: 4.7 million which is based on the marked to market value.
50 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 235200 UKCPT pp44-pp57 21 04 2015 15:22 Page 51 Interest is payable by UKPCEL at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the market value of the property portfolio in UKCPEL expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage as well as any cash generated from the sale of one of these properties.
If the LTV percentage is equal to or less than 25 per cent, the margin is 1.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 25 per cent and does not exceed 35 per cent, the margin is 1.70 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 35 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 1.85 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 45 per cent, the margin is 1.95 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 45 per cent and does not exceed 60 per cent, the margin is 2.0 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2014 the applicable margin was 1.70 per cent 2013 1.70 per cent.
Swap Instruments As at 31 December 2014 the Group had in place interest rate swap instruments totalling 230 million all of which were deemed to be effective hedges as per note 1 q.
The revaluation of these swaps at the year end resulted in a loss arising on interest rate swaps of 1.3 million 2013: gain 9.7 million.
Of the total loss arising on interest rate swaps, 1.3 million related to effective hedge instruments 2013: gain 9.7 million which is credited through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The valuation techniques applied to fair value the derivatives include the swap models including the CVA DVA swap models, using present value calculations.
The model incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rates.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2014 amounted to 8.3 million 2013: 6.9 million.
Based on current yield curves and non-performance risk, 3.6 million of this value relates to the next 12 months and is therefore classified as a current liability.
The remainder is classified as a long term liability.

Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
The Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations and loan facilities and swap instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of investment properties recognized in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,265,231 1,265,231 31 December 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Investment properties - - 1,042,728 1,042,728 The lowest level of input is the underlying yield on each property which is an input not based on observable market data.

Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of investment properties is calculated using unobservable inputs as described in note 8.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
The fair value of the bank loans are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using the current interest rates applicable to each loan.
Real Estate Risk The Group has identified the following risks associated with the real estate portfolio: The cost of any development schemes may increase if there are delays in the planning process.
The Group uses advisers who are experts in the specific planning requirements in the schemes location in order to reduce the risks that may arise in the planning process: A major tenant may become insolvent causing a significant loss of rental income and a reduction in the value of the associated property see also credit risk below.
To reduce this risk, the Group reviews the financial status of all prospective tenants and decides on the appropriate level of security required via rental deposits or guarantees: The exposure of the fair values of the portfolio to market and occupier fundamentals such as tenants financial position.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the market value of properties and financial instruments will change.
A 10 per cent increase in the fair value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2014 would have increased net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 126.5 million 2013: 104.3 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in the fair value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and net profit by 126.5 million 2013: 104.3 million.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 53 235200 UKCPT pp44-pp57 21 04 2015 15:22 Page 54 Notes to the Accounts continued The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2014 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 63,379 - - 63,379 Rent receivable 960 - - 960 Other debtors 2,232 - - 2,232 66,571 - - 66,571 Financial Assets 2013 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 80,734 - - 80,734 Rent receivable 1,256 - - 1,256 Other debtors 1,612 - - 1,612 83,602 - - 83,602 In the event of default by a tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitors such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2014 is 960,000 2013: 1,256,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 1,891,000 2013: 807,000 as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
All tenant deposits are in line with market practice.
There is no residual credit risk associated with the financial assets of the Group.
No financial assets past due are impaired.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
41.2 million 2013: 38.8 million of the year end cash balance is held in the Ignis Liquidity Fund, which is a money market fund and has a triple A rating.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a financial institution may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution subject to restrictions under the loan facility.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
While commercial properties are not immediately realisable, the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
54 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 235200 UKCPT pp44-pp57 21 04 2015 15:22 Page 55 At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2014 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan and interest rate swap 2,234 85,296 164,769 252,299 Other creditors 20,495 - 1,891 22,386 22,729 85,296 166,660 274,685 Financial Liabilities 2013 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 2,234 6,702 254,749 263,685 Other creditors 17,139 - 807 17,946 19,373 6,702 255,556 281,631 The amounts in the table are based on contractual undiscounted payments.
Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than one year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.6 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have increased the reported profit by 634,000 2013: increased the reported profit by 807,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have reduced the reported profit by 634,000 2013: decreased the reported profit by 807,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Groups bank loans have been hedged by interest rate swaps, these loans are not subject to interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had in place a total of 230 million of interest rate swap instruments 2013: 230 million.
The values of these instruments are marked to market and will change if interest rates change.
It is estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability falling by 5.2 million 2013: 7.0 million which would increase the reported other comprehensive income by the same amount.
A decrease of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability increasing by 5.2 million 2013: 7.0 million which would decrease the reported other comprehensive income by the same amount.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Group considers that capital comprises issued ordinary shares, net of shares held in treasury, and long-term borrowings.
The Groups capital is deployed in the acquisition and management of property assets meeting the Groups investment criteria with a view to earning returns for shareholders which are typically made by way of payment of regular dividends.
The Group also has a policy on the buyback of shares which it sets out in the Directors Authority to Buy Back Shares section of the Directors Report.
The Groups capital is managed in accordance with investment policy which is to hold a diversified property portfolio of freehold and long leasehold UK commercial properties.
The Group invests in income producing properties.
The Group will principally invest in four commercial property sectors: office, retail, industrial and Leisure.
The Group is permitted to invest up to 15 per cent of its Total Assets in indirect property funds and other listed investment companies.
The Group is permitted to invest cash, held by it for working capital purposes and awaiting investments, in cash deposits, gilts and money market funds.
UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 55 235200 UKCPT pp44-pp57 21 04 2015 15:22 Page 56 Notes to the Accounts continued The Group monitors capital primarily through regular financial reporting and also through a gearing policy.
Gearing is defined as gross borrowings divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The Groups gearing policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Report of the Directors.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements but does have banking covenants on which it monitors and reports on a quarterly basis.
Included in these covenants are requirements to monitor loan to value ratios which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the market value of the properties secured.
The Groups Loan to value ratio is shown below.
The Group did not breach any of its loan covenants, nor did it default on any other of its obligations under its loan arrangements in the year to 31 December 2014.
2014 2013 000 000 Carrying amount of interest-bearing loans and borrowings 229,637 229,252 External valuation of completed investment property excluding lease incentive adjustment 1,272,315 1,048,705 Loan to value ratio 18.05% 21.86% The Groups capital balances are set out on page 39 and are regarded as the Groups equity and net funds.
Capital Commitments The Group had no contracted capital commitments as at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 nil.
Lease Length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income under non-cancellable operating leases, based on the unexpired lease length at the year end was as follows based on total rentals : 2014 2013 000 000 Less than one year 67,477 63,511 Between one and five years 209,661 196,210 Over five years 341,578 264,955 Total 618,716 524,676 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 3.74 per cent 2013: 6.44 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of annualised total rental value was 2.6 per cent 2013: 4.4 per cent at the year end.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analysis of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in Portfolio Statistics on page 17.
Service charge The Groups managing agents Jones Lang LaSalle manage service charge accounts for all the Groups properties.
The Group pays the service charge on any vacant units.
Service charges on rental properties are recharged to tenants.
The total service charge incurred in the year to 31 December 2014 was 7.1 million 2013: 8.5 million.
Of this figure, the service charge paid by the Group in respect of void units was 1.7 million 2013: 2.2 million and is included in direct property expenses.
Post Balance Sheet Events On 23 January 2015 the Company completed the sale of Pall Mall Court, King Street, Manchester for a consideration of 19.5 million.
On 28 January 2015 the Company completed the sale of the Weston-super-Mare Unit Trust for a consideration of 29.9 million.
On 6 February 2015 the Company completed the purchase of the car park at Regent Circus, Swindon for a consideration of 1.8 million.
In April 2015, the Company secured twelve year financing at an all in-rate of 3.03% from Cornerstone Real Estate Advisors Europe LLP, part of the Mass Mutual Financial Group.
This was used to repay the 80 million Lloyds facility which was due to expire in June 2015 and the associated swap liabilities at the time of repayment.
In addition, the Company obtained a 50 million revolving credit facility from Barclays at a margin of 1.5% over 1 month LIBOR.
As part of this deal, the existing Barclays term loan was extended out to April 2020 and the margin on this loan was cut to 1.5%.
To date this revolving credit facility has not been utilised.
The Company also repaid all swaps with Barclays that existed at 31 December 2014 and replaced these with one new 5 year swap at a rate of 1.299%.
As part of the restructuring required to facilitate the new debt arrangements a new subsidiary company was set up in March 2015 called UK Commercial Property Finance Holdings Limited.
The purpose of this Company is a holding company.
In addition, linked to the debt process described above, the Company also held an Extraordinary General Meeting in March 2015 at which shareholders passed a Resolution to amend the Articles of Association of the Company so as to replace the continuation vote due in 2016 with a continuation vote in 2020 and at least seven yearly thereafter.
