Resolution 18 Purchase of own shares The Companies Act 2006 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution 18, if passed, would give the Company the authority to purchase any of its own issued ordinary shares at a price of not less than an amount equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share and not more than the higher of: i 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of the Companys ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five dealing days before any purchase is made: and ii the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange plc.
The authority will enable the purchase of up to a maximum of 11,676,877 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM, and will expire on the earlier of 31 July 2015 being the latest date by which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2015 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2015.
The directors will only exercise this buy back authority after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall position of the Company.
Purchases would be financed out of distributable profits and shares purchased would either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly or held as treasury shares.
The Company operates two share option schemes under which awards may be satisfied by the allotment or transfer of ordinary shares to a scheme participant.
However, in practice, the Company has always satisfied awards to participants by the transfer of ordinary shares from the trustee of each of the schemes.
As at 1 April 2014 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report, options had been granted over 2,215,484 ordinary shares the Option Shares representing approximately 1.90% of the Companys issued share capital at that date.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares as described in Resolution 18 were exercised in full, the Option Shares would represent approximately 2.11% of the Companys issued share capital as at 1 April 2014.
As at 1 April 2014, the Company did not hold any treasury shares.
