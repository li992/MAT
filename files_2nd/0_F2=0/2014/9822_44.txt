Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 4 October 2014 12 Property, plant and equipment continued The Level 2 fair values of land and buildings have been obtained using a market approach, primarily using earnings multiples derived from prices in observed transactions involving comparable businesses.
The Level 3 fair values of the specialised brewery properties have been obtained using a cost approach.
These breweries represent properties that are rarely, if ever, sold in the market, except by way of a sale of the business of which they are part, due to the uniqueness arising from their specialised nature, design and configuration.
As such the valuation of these properties has been performed using the depreciated replacement cost approach, which values the properties at the current cost of replacing them with their modern equivalents less deductions for physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.
The significant unobservable inputs to the Level 3 fair value measurements are: Sensitivity of fair value to unobservable inputs Current cost of modern equivalent asset The higher the cost the higher the fair value Amount of adjustment for physical deterioration obsolescence The higher the adjustment the lower the fair value 2014 2013 Level 3 recurring fair value measurements m m At beginning of the period 23.7 23.4 Additions 0.3 0.6 Depreciation charge for the period 0.3 0.3 At end of the period 23.7 23.7 The Groups properties are revalued by external independent qualified valuers at least once in each rolling three year period.
