Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 147 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segment reporting IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The groups chief operating decision maker is deemed to be the executive committee comprising both Peter Crook Chief Executive, and Andrew Fisher Finance Director whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The groups segments comprise Vanquis Bank, CCD, Moneybarn and Central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the executive committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The executive committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the group financial statements.

The exceptional cost in 2013 of 13.7m related to the cost of a business restructuring within CCD, including the redundancy costs associated with a headcount reduction of 520 employees.
The exceptional cost was stated net of an exceptional curtailment credit of 1.6m associated with those employees made redundant who were part of the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 19.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 60.4m 2013: 28.8m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
The significant increase in central net assets reflects the goodwill 71.2m, and intangible assets 72.5m arising on acquisition of Moneybarn which are held on consolidation.
Provident Financial plc 148 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segment reporting continued The groups businesses operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland, other than a branch in Poland which was established as part of Vanquis Banks pilot credit card operation in Poland.
The revenue in respect of the branch in 2014 amounted to 5.2m 2013: 2.2m and the loss amounted to 10.6m 2013: 7.6m.
The net liabilities of the branch amounted to 18.7m at 31 December 2014 2013: 9.5m, comprising assets of 22.3m 2013: 16.0m and liabilities of 41.0m 2013: 25.5m.
These figures are included within the Vanquis Bank figures in the tables above.
Subsequent to the 2014 year end, a decision was made to withdraw from the Polish pilot credit card operation.
The acquired intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships is held on consolidation and, therefore, the amortisation charge has been allocated to Central in the above analysis, consistent with the net asset analysis.
2 Revenue Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs e. g. aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in CCD the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.

Interest income relates to the interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards and the service charge on home credit loans.
Fee income in Vanquis Bank predominantly reflects default and overlimit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as interchange income and Repayment Option Plan ROP fees.
Fee income in 2014 represented 28% 2013: 30% of Vanquis Bank revenue.

This primarily reflects the development of the retail deposits programme in Vanquis Bank during 2014.
Retail deposits represent approximately 38% of the groups funding at the end of 2014 compared with approximately 34% in 2013.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2014, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources in adherence with the PRAs liquidity regime, was 3.4% 2013: 3.8%.
The group funding rate is expected to moderate further to approximately 6% in 2015.
Interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as profit before tax, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional costs, in 2014 was 4.1 times compared with 3.7 times in 2013.

The effective tax rate for 2014 prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs, is 21.5% in line with the UK statutory corporation tax rate which reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014.
A further reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate will take place with effect from 1 April 2015 when the rate reduces from 21% to 20%.
The group is expected to benefit from the rate reduction and the effective tax rates for future periods are expected to be similar to the UK statutory corporation tax rate.
Provident Financial plc 150 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Tax charge continued As the changes to the UK statutory corporation tax rate were enacted in the 2013 Finance Act, deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 were re-measured at 20% on the basis that that the temporary differences on which the deferred tax balances were calculated were expected to reverse after 1 April 2015.
In 2014, movements in the deferred tax balances have been measured at the statutory corporation tax rate for the year of 21.50% 2013: 23.25%.
The deferred tax balances at 31 December 2014 have then been re-measured at 20% as the temporary differences on which deferred tax has been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2015.
A tax credit of 1.3m in 2014 2013: charge of 0.7m represents the income statement adjustment as a result of this change and an additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m 2013: 0.3m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

This can be reconciled as follows: Group 2014 2013 m m Profit before taxation 224.6 182.4 Profit before taxation multiplied by the average standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 21.50% 2013: 23.25% 48.3 42.4 Effects of: benefit of lower tax rates overseas 0.6 0.7 adjustment in respect of prior years 1.4 1.3 non deductible general expenses 0.4 0.3 non deductible expenses relating to the acquisition of Moneybarn 0.8 impact of change in UK tax rate 1.3 0.7 Total tax charge 49.0 41.4 The profits of the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland have been taxed at the Republic of Ireland statutory tax rate of 12.5% 2013: 12.5% rather than the UK statutory tax rate of 21.50% 2013: 23.25% giving rise to a beneficial impact on the group tax charge of 0.6m 2013: 0.7m.
The 1.4m charge 2013: 1.3m credit in respect of prior years represents an increase in the prior year tax charge in respect of historic tax liabilities net of the benefit of securing tax deductions for employee share awards which are higher than those originally anticipated.
During 2014, the group incurred 3.9m of expenses in relation to the acquisition of Moneybarn which have been included in exceptional costs.
As tax deductions are unlikely to be available for such costs, these give rise to an increase in the tax charge of 0.8m 2013: nil.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 151 Notes to the financial statements continued 6 Earnings per share The group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data on its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met as at that date.
ii For share options outstanding under non-performance related schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group also presents an adjusted EPS, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted earnings per share are set out below: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Earnings per share Shares in issue during the year 142.3 139.1 Own shares held 3.5 3.8 Basic earnings per share 175.6 138.8 126.5 141.0 135.3 104.2 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 2.2 2.0 2.7 2.0 Diluted earnings per share 175.6 141.0 124.5 141.0 138.0 102.2 The directors have elected to show an adjusted earnings per share prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles which arose on the acquisition of Moneybarn on 20 August 2014 see note 10 and prior to exceptional costs see note 1.
This is presented to show the earnings per share generated by the groups underlying operations.
A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share to adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount Group m m pence m m pence Basic earnings per share 175.6 138.8 126.5 141.0 135.3 104.2 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of tax 1.9 1.4 Exceptional costs, net of tax 6.5 4.7 10.5 7.8 Adjusted basic earnings per share 184.0 138.8 132.6 151.5 135.3 112.0 Diluted earnings per share 175.6 141.0 124.5 141.0 138.0 102.2 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of tax 1.9 1.4 Exceptional costs, net of tax 6.5 4.6 10.5 7.6 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 184.0 141.0 130.5 151.5 138.0 109.8 Adjusted basic EPS has grown by 18.4% in 2014 primarily due to the strong performance of Vanquis Bank.
This growth is lower than the 19.5% growth in profit before tax, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs as a result of the 5.9m placement of shares for the acquisition of Moneybarn, partly offset by the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% on 1 April 2014.

If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 7 May 2015, this dividend will be paid on 19 June 2015 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 22 May 2015.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 as it is subject to shareholder approval.
As a result of adjusted EPS growth of 18.4% in 2014, the directors have proposed an increase in the final dividend of 18.3% which, together with the 10.0% increase in the interim dividend, makes a total full-year dividend increase of 15.3%.
Accordingly, dividend cover, prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs, in 2014 was 1.35 times, compared with the minimum target of 1.25 times.
8 Directors remuneration The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24, Related party disclosures.
Group and company 2014 2013 m m Short-term employee benefits 3.6 4.0 Post-employment benefits 0.4 0.6 Share-based payment charge 3.7 2.9 Total 7.7 7.5 The directors remuneration above reflects: Short-term employee benefits comprise salary fees, bonus and benefits earned in the year.
Post-employment benefits represent the sum of: i the increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension benefits less directors contributions for those directors who are members of the groups defined benefit pension scheme: ii company contributions into personal pension arrangements for all other directors: and iii amounts accrued under the Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS.
The share-based payment charge is the proportion of the groups share-based payment charge that relates to those options and awards granted to the directors.
This differs to the directors remuneration report on pages 116 to 128 which does not include the share-based payment charge of 3.7m 2013: 2.9m but includes the value of LTIS and PSP share awards due to vest in 2015 of 6.6m 2013: 5.2m.
The value is calculated assuming 100% of share awards vest at the average share price during the last three months of the year.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 153 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Employee information a The average monthly number of persons employed by the group was as follows: Group 2014 2013 Number Number Vanquis Bank 1,021 909 CCD 2,390 2,869 Moneybarn 102 Central 55 55 Total group 3,568 3,833 Analysed as: Full time 3,105 3,236 Part time 463 597 Total group 3,568 3,833 Employees comprise all head office and branch employees within CCD, head office and contact centre employees within Vanquis Bank, Moneybarn and corporate office employees and executive directors.
It does not include the 7,700 self-employed agents within CCD.
The 16.7% reduction in CCD employee numbers reflects the impact of the business restructuring which took place during 2013 and 2014.
Vanquis Bank employee numbers have increased by 12% during 2014 due to the growth of the business, including the continued expansion of the second contact centre in CCDs head office in Bradford.
b Employment costs Group 2014 2013 m m Aggregate gross wages and salaries paid to the groups employees 123.2 116.0 Employers National Insurance contributions 14.4 13.5 Pension charge, prior to exceptional pension credit 8.7 10.7 Share-based payment charge note 25 8.7 7.4 Total employment cost prior to exceptional costs 155.0 147.6 Exceptional pension credit note 19 0.6 1.6 Exceptional redundancy costs note 1 4.0 12.6 Total employment costs 158.4 158.6 The pension charge comprises the retirement benefit charge for defined benefit schemes, contributions to the stakeholder pension plan, contributions to personal pension arrangements and amounts accrued under the UURBS.
The increase in the share-based payment charge from 7.4m in 2013 to 8.7m in 2014 primarily reflects the impact of prior year provision releases in 2013 following the departure of Chris Gillespie, a former executive director.
Provident Financial plc 154 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Acquisition of Moneybarn The group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Duncton Group Limited, which trades as Moneybarn, the UKs largest non-standard vehicle finance business, on 20 August 2014 for consideration of 120m.
The consideration was satisfied by the payment of 120m in cash on completion to Duncton Group Limiteds shareholders, funded through the proceeds of a placing of 5.9m new ordinary shares in Provident Financial plc with institutional investors.
The acquisition of Moneybarn broadens the product offering to the groups target customer base and creates a third leg of earnings that complements the groups organic growth opportunities.
Costs of 3.9m associated with the acquisition including due diligence, legal, advisory and tax fees have been charged as an exceptional cost in 2014 see note 1.
Costs of 3.1m associated with the placing of ordinary shares in respect of the acquisition have been deducted from the share premium account.
Prior to acquisition, Moneybarn reported under UK GAAP.
A detailed conversion of Moneybarns financial statements to IFRS has been completed post acquisition which reduced Moneybarns net assets on acquisition by approximately 11m, principally in respect of: i higher impairment provisions due to the impact of discounting future expected cash flows at the effective interest rate: and ii a change in policy in respect of the deferral of the acquisition costs of new accounts.
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Moneybarn as at the acquisition date were as follows: Book value on Fair value Recognised on acquisition adjustments acquisition m m m Intangible assets a 1.0 75.0 76.0 Property, plant and equipment 0.9 0.9 Deferred tax assets liabilities c 2.6 14.1 11.5 Amounts receivable from customers b 135.0 3.8 131.2 Cash and cash equivalents 5.2 5.2 Trade and other receivables 4.8 4.8 Trade and other payables c 5.2 1.0 6.2 Corporation tax liabilities 1.7 1.7 Bank and other borrowings d 144.9 5.0 149.9 Net identifiable liabilities assets acquired 2.3 51.1 48.8 Goodwill 71.2 Cash consideration 120.0 The fair value adjustments applied to Moneybarns net assets comprise: a 75.0m has been attributed to the fair value of Moneybarns existing broker relationships which are an important influence on the revenue-generating capacity of the business see note 12. b An adjustment to receivables of 3.8m has been made to reflect the fair value of the receivables book at the acquisition date.
This adjustment principally relates to the expected losses on those accounts which are not yet in arrears and therefore have not yet attracted an impairment provision under IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Expected losses are currently only taken account of as part of the calculation of fair value on the acquisition of a receivables book in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations.
Expected loss provisions have not been established on new Moneybarn accounts originated post acquisition in line with both the groups accounting policies and IAS 39. c The tax effect of the other fair value adjustments of 14.1m together with 1.0m of additional potential liabilities which were not provided against at the acquisition date have been made.
d The existing Moneybarn borrowings were refinanced shortly following acquisition, utilising the groups existing committed facilities at a substantially lower cost of funds.
The fair value of debt on acquisition has been increased to include the break costs of 5.0m that were incurred in settling Moneybarns existing debt.
The goodwill of 71.2m represents the benefit of the groups lower cost funding and synergies available from the acquisition in respect of underwriting, collections and distribution channels.
In accordance with the groups accounting policies, goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for corporation tax purposes.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 155 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Acquisition of Moneybarn continued An analysis of the fair value of the receivables acquired compared with the gross contractual amounts of the receivables book and the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected is as follows: Contractual Gross cash flows contractual not expected Fair value amounts to be collected m m m Amounts receivable from customers 131.2 225.0 24.7 The gross contractual amounts of receivables relates to the total contractual amount due from the customers over the life of the contract.
Cash flows not expected to be collected are the undiscounted cash flows not expected to be collected based on historical experience.
Moneybarn generated revenue of 13.8m and a profit before tax, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items of 5.8m in the four months following acquisition.
In the eight months prior to acquisition, Moneybarn generated revenue of 24.2m and a profit before tax and exceptional costs of 4.6m.
Had the acquisition completed on the first day of the financial year and Moneybarn had benefited from the groups lower cost of funding in the first eight months of the year, the groups revenue would have been 24.2m higher at 1,099.9m and group profit before tax, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional costs would have been 9.2m higher at 243.6m.

The additions to investments in 2014 represent the gross consideration of 120.0m in respect of the acquisition of Moneybarn see note 10.
The additions to investments in 2013 of 0.8m represented the issue of share options awards by the company to its subsidiaries employees.
Under IFRIC 11, the fair value of these options awards is required to be treated as a capital contribution and an investment in the relevant subsidiary, net of any share options awards that have vested.
The adjustment in respect of IFRIC 11 in 2014 amounted to a credit of 0.4m and has been treated as a disposal.

Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 159 Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Amounts receivable from customers On inception of a loan, receivables represent the amounts initially advanced to customers plus directly attributable issue costs.
Subsequently, receivables are increased by the revenue recognised and reduced by cash collections and any deduction for impairment.
Revenue is recognised on the net value of the receivable after deduction for impairment and not on the gross receivable prior to impairment.
Illustrative examples of revenue and impairment accounting in home credit can be found in the investor section of the companys website.

15.5m of Vanquis Banks receivables at the end of 2014 relate to the pilot credit card operation in Poland 2013: 5.3m.
CCD receivables comprise 583.1m in respect of the home credit business 2013: 738.2m, 5.0m in respect of Satsuma 2013: 1.8m.
Home credit receivables showed a 21.1% fall in 2014 reflecting the impact of significantly tighter credit standards which restricted the recruitment of more marginal customers into the business together with relatively subdued demand for the majority of the year.
The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 31% for Vanquis Bank 2013: 32%, 112% for CCD 2012: 110% and 29% for Moneybarn.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is 6.0 months 2013: 6.0 months and within Moneybarn is 32 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 1.5% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 2.9 billion 2013: 2.3 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
The credit quality of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: 2014 2013 Vanquis Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Bank CCD Group Credit quality of amounts receivable from customers m m m m m m m Neither past due nor impaired 1,022.0 258.4 119.2 1,399.6 785.9 259.3 1,045.2 Past due but not impaired 64.6 64.6 99.4 99.4 Impaired 87.4 265.1 32.5 385.0 80.7 381.3 462.0 Total 1,109.4 588.1 151.7 1,849.2 866.6 740.0 1,606.6 2014 2013 Vanquis Vanquis Bank CCD Moneybarn Group Bank CCD Group Credit quality of amounts receivable from customers % % % % % % % Neither past due nor impaired 92.1 43.9 78.6 75.7 90.7 35.1 65.0 Past due but not impaired 11.0 3.5 13.4 6.2 Impaired 7.9 45.1 21.4 20.8 9.3 51.5 28.8 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Past due but not impaired balances all relate to home credit loans within CCD.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank or Moneybarn which are past due but not impaired.
In home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate materially.
The improved arrears profile in Vanquis Bank reflects the record low arrears currently being experienced by the business.
The improvement in the arrears profile of CCD reflects the significant improvement in the credit quality of the receivables book as a result of the tighter credit standards introduced in September 2013 and the benefit from the implementation of standardised arrears and collections processes.
Provident Financial plc 160 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Amounts receivable from customers continued The following table sets out the ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances within the home credit business of CCD based on contractual arrears since the inception of the loan: Group 2014 2013 Ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances m m One week overdue 44.8 63.3 Two weeks overdue 11.6 19.2 Three weeks or more overdue 8.2 16.9 Past due but not impaired 64.6 99.4 Impairment in Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn is deducted from the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers by the use of an allowance account.
The movement in the allowance account during the year is as follows: Group 2014 2013 Vanquis Bank allowance account m m At 1 January 128.8 91.4 Charge for the year 149.1 129.4 Amounts written off during the year 123.3 99.4 Amounts recovered during the year 24.0 7.4 At 31 December 178.6 128.8 Group 2014 Moneybarn allowance account m On acquisition 27.0 Charge for the period 1.2 Amounts written off during the period 1.1 Amounts recovered during the period At 31 December 27.1 Within CCD, impairments are deducted directly from amounts receivable from customers without the use of an allowance account.
The impairment charge in respect of amounts receivable from customers reflected within operating costs can be analysed as follows: Group 2014 2013 Impairment charge on amounts receivable from customers m m Vanquis Bank 149.1 129.4 CCD 177.5 269.7 Moneybarn 1.2 Total group 327.8 399.1 The impairment charge in Vanquis Bank comprises 144.9m 2013: 126.3m in respect of the UK business and 4.2m 2013: 3.1m in respect of the Polish pilot operation.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 161 Notes to the financial statements continued 15 Amounts receivable from customers continued Interest income recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired can be analysed as follows: Group 2014 2013 Interest income recognised on impaired amounts receivable from customers m m Vanquis Bank 30.9 28.2 CCD 299.8 367.2 Moneybarn 2.5 Total group 333.2 395.4 IFRS requires interest revenue to be recognised on the net carrying value of a receivable after deductions for impairment and not on the outstanding amount of the loan prior to impairment.
Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 1,288.0m subject to the normal suspension of interest where applicable and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for IFRS purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 1,109.4m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 178.6m.
The non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more mainstream customers.
As the group recognises impairment events early after missing two weekly payments in the last 12 weeks in home credit and after missing one monthly payment in Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2014 2013 Currency profile of amounts receivable from customers m m Sterling 1,779.8 1,545.1 Euro 53.9 56.2 Zloty 15.5 5.3 Total group 1,849.2 1,606.6 Euro receivables represent loans issued by the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland, and amount to 9% of CCDs receivables 2013: 8%.
Zloty receivables relate to the Vanquis Bank pilot credit card operation in Poland.
Under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, receivables are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded on an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through future cash flows.

Until August 2014, cross currency swaps were also held to fix the foreign exchange rate on the groups borrowings denominated in US dollars.
The cross currency swaps matured on repayment of the US dollar private placements.

a Hedging reserve movements The fair value of derivative financial instruments is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
Generally, providing the derivative financial instruments meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
The groups derivative financial instruments all currently meet these criteria.
If the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
Conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Interest rate swaps 2.3 2.7 2.3 2.7 2004 cross-currency swaps 0.2 0.2 Foreign exchange contracts 0.1 0.2 Net credit to the hedging reserve 2.2 2.7 2.3 2.7 Under IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows, using appropriate market rates and yield curves.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 165 Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Derivative financial instruments continued b Income statement There was no impact on the income statement of the group and the company in the year in respect of the movement in the fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps, previously designated as cash flow hedges 2013: nil.
c Interest rate swaps The group and company use interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the groups borrowings.
The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2014 2013 m m Liability at 1 January 6.7 9.4 Credited to the hedging reserve 2.3 2.7 Liability at 31 December 4.4 6.7 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 3.2 3.1-3.3 1.4 3.2 3.1-3.3 2.4 d Cross-currency swaps The group and company used cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2003 and 2004.
All of the cross-currency swaps have now matured, in line with the maturity and repayment of the underlying borrowing.
2003 private placement loan notes The group and company put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed-rate interest of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed-rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps matched the underlying loan notes.
These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 until maturity.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange rate movements on the underlying loan notes were deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes matured in 2013.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2014 2013 m m Liability at 1 January 1.9 Exchange rate movement 1.9 Liability at 31 December There was no difference between the translation of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate 2013: nil.
There was no exchange rate movement in the year of this difference in translation 2013: debit of 1.9m.
Corresponding entries were made within borrowings.
Provident Financial plc 166 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 17 Derivative financial instruments continued 2004 private placement loan notes The group put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes into floating rate sterling-denominated interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps matched the underlying loan notes which were repaid on 14 August 2014.
The swaps were designated as cash flow and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 until maturity.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes were deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on the fair value hedge in the year.
In 2013, the swaps had a range of interest rates of LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 0.6 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2014 2013 m m Asset at 1 January 5.4 8.1 Exchange rate movement 5.2 2.5 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.2 0.2 Asset at 31 December 5.4 There is no difference between the translation of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate 2013: debit of 5.2m.
The exchange rate movement of 5.2m credit 2013: 2.5m reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
Corresponding entries are made within borrowings.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cash flow hedge portion of the crosscurrency swaps and the cash flow hedge portion of the exchange rate movements described above.
e Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland and Vanquis Banks branch in Poland.
An asset of 0.2m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2013: 0.1m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 6.5m 2013: 7.1m.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 20 January 2015 to 20 October 2015 2013: 18 February 2014 to 16 December 2014.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.1m has been credited to the hedging reserve within equity 2013: 0.2m.

As at 31 December 2014, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The groups defined benefit pension scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The scheme covers 22% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
All future benefits in the scheme are now provided on a cash balance basis, with a defined amount being made available at retirement, based on a percentage of salary that is revalued up to retirement with reference to increases in price inflation.
This retirement account is then used to purchase an annuity on the open market.
The scheme also provides pension benefits that were accrued in the past on a final salary basis, but which are no longer linked to final salary.
The scheme also provides death benefits.
The scheme is a UK registered pension scheme under UK legislation and is not contracted-out of the Second State Pension.
The scheme is governed by a Trust Deed and Rules, with trustees responsible for the operation and the governance of the scheme.
The Trustees work closely with the group on funding and investment strategy decisions.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 June 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on the results of the 2012 valuation, updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The group is entitled to a refund of any surplus, subject to tax, if the scheme winds up after all benefits have been paid.
The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are as follows: Investment risk the liabilities for IAS 19 purposes are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the assets underperform this yield a deficit will arise.
The scheme has a long-term objective to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that better match liabilities.
Change in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the liabilities, although this will be partly offset by an increase in matching assets.
Inflation risk part of the liabilities are linked to inflation.
If inflation increases then liabilities will increase, although this will be partly offset by an increase in assets.
As part of a long-term fide-risking strategy, the scheme will further increase its portfolio in inflation matched assets.
Life expectancies the schemes final salary benefits provide pensions for the rest of members lives and for their spouses lives.
If members live longer than assumed, then the liabilities in respect of final salary benefits increase.

The weighted average duration of the scheme is approximately 22 years.
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2014 2013 % % Price inflation RPI 3.1 3.4 Price inflation CPI 2.1 2.4 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.9 3.1 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.1 2.4 Discount rate 3.7 4.4 The pension increase assumption shown above applies to pensions increasing in payment each year in line with RPI up to 5%.
Pensions accrued prior to 2000 are substantially subject to fixed 5% increases each year.
In deferment increases prior to retirement are linked to CPI.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of self-administered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and Future mortality improvements are in line with CMI 2013 projections with long-term trend improvements of 1.25% per annum.
In more simple terms, it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 24 years if they are male 2013: 24 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2013: 25 years.
The table below shows the sensitivity on the defined benefit obligation not including any impact on assets of changes in the key assumptions.
Depending on the scenario, there would also be compensating asset movements.

Provident Financial plc 172 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Deferred tax Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivative financial instruments, the groups pension asset, deductions for employee share awards which are recognised differently for tax purposes and property, plant and equipment which is depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes.
The deferred tax liability recognised on the acquisition of Moneybarn relates primarily to the intangible asset in respect of Moneybarns broker relationships which will be amortised in future periods but for which tax deductions will not be available.
This is presented net of deferred tax assets in respect of the transitional adjustments arising in Moneybarn on adoption of IFRS, tax relief for which is available in post acquisition periods.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
Following the changes in corporation tax rates in 2013, deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 were re-measured at 20% on the basis that the temporary differences on which the deferred tax was calculated were expected to reverse after 1 April 2015.
A tax credit of 1.3m in 2014 2013: charge of 0.7m represents the income statement adjustment as a result of this change.
An additional deferred tax credit of 0.3m 2013: 0.3m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in respect of items reflected directly in other comprehensive income.
The movement in the deferred tax balance during the year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 Liability asset m m m m At 1 January 3.5 6.1 2.8 0.9 Charge to the income statement note 5 3.0 2.5 1.5 2.7 Acquisition of Moneybarn note 10 11.5 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to impact of change in UK tax rate note 5 4.2 0.3 4.3 0.3 Impact of change in UK tax rate: credit charge to the income statement 1.3 0.7 0.1 0.2 credit to other comprehensive income 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 13.6 3.5 8.2 2.8 An analysis of the deferred tax liability asset for the group is set out below: 2014 2013 Accelerated Other Retirement Accelerated Other Retirement capital temporary benefit capital temporary benefit allowances differences obligations Total allowances differences obligations Total Group liability asset m m m m m m m m At 1 January 1.7 7.6 5.8 3.5 1.7 9.7 5.3 6.1 Credit charge to the income statement 0.3 1.6 1.7 3.0 0.3 0.5 2.3 2.5 Acquisition of Moneybarn note 10 11.5 11.5 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to change in UK tax rate 0.4 3.8 4.2 0.6 0.9 0.3 Impact of change in UK tax rate: credit charge to the income statement 1.2 0.1 1.3 0.3 0.8 0.4 0.7 c redit charge to other comprehensive income 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.3 At 31 December 2.0 4.7 10.9 13.6 1.7 7.6 5.8 3.5 Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 173 Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Deferred tax continued An analysis of the deferred tax liability for the company is set out below: 2014 2013 Accelerated Other Retirement Accelerated Other Retirement capital temporary benefit capital temporary benefit allowances differences obligations Total allowances differences obligations Total Company liability m m m m m m m m At 1 January 0.4 3.4 5.8 2.8 0.6 5.0 5.3 0.9 Credit charge to the income statement 0.1 0.1 1.7 1.5 0.2 0.6 2.3 2.7 Charge credit on other comprehensive income prior to impact of change in UK taxrate 0.5 3.8 4.3 0.6 0.9 0.3 Impact of change in UK tax rate: credit charge to the income statement 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.2 c redit charge to other comprehensive income 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.3 At 31 December 0.3 3.0 10.9 8.2 0.4 3.4 5.8 2.8 Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary timing differences because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
21 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, floats held by agents within CCD and Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, held in accordance with the PRAs liquidity regime.
The PRA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer and other liquid resources to ensure they have available funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of the liquid assets buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA prepared by Vanquis Bank.
In addition, further liquid resources must be maintained based upon daily stress tests linked to three key liquidity risks of Vanquis Bank, namely retail deposits maturities, undrawn credit card lines and operating cash flows.
This results in a dynamic liquid resources requirement, largely driven by retail deposits maturities in the following three months.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources, amounts to 121.4m in 2014 2013: 86.3m and is held in a combination of UK government gilts of 65.7m 2013: 60.4m and a designated money market fund with exposure to the UK government only of 55.7m 2013: 25.9m Group Company 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Cash at bank and in hand 145.9 119.0 7.7 13.6 In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the group had 5.2m of bank overdrafts at 31 December 2014 2013: 9.3m and the company had 2.6m of bank overdrafts 2013: 2.9m both of which are disclosed within bank and other borrowings see note 22.

g Retail deposits Vanquis Bank is a PRA regulated bank and commenced taking retail deposits in July 2011.
As at 31 December 2014, 580.3m 2013: 435.1m of fixed-rate, fixed-term retail deposits of one, two, three, four and five years had been taken.
The deposits in issue at 31 December 2014 have been issued at rates of between 1.66% and 4.65%.
A reconciliation of the movement in retail deposits is set out below: Group 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 435.1 327.4 New funds received 190.7 187.7 Maturities 69.7 114.9 Retentions 26.6 31.8 Cancellations 8.9 3.2 Capitalised interest 6.5 6.3 At 31 December 580.3 435.1 h Subordinated loan notes On 15 June 2005, the company issued 100.0m of subordinated loan notes repayable on 15 June 2015.
94.0m of the liability was settled in 2009.
The rights of repayment to holders of the loan notes are subordinated to all other borrowings and liabilities of the company upon a winding up of the company and, in certain circumstances, upon its administration.
i Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fund 100% of its receivables book through retail deposits.
Financial statements Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 177 Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Bank and other borrowings continued The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December were as follows: Group and company 2014 2013 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within one to two years 235.2 Expiring in more than two years 111.5 Total group and company 111.5 235.2 The table above excludes the additional capacity for Vanquis Bank to take retail deposits up to the value of the intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc of 342.2m as at 31 December 2014.

Provident Financial plc sponsors the Provident Financial plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust EBT which is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of the employees of the group.
The company has appointed Kleinwort Benson Jersey Trustees Limited to act as trustee of the EBT.
The trustee has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The shares have been acquired by the EBT to meet obligations under the Provident Financial Long Term Incentive Scheme 2006 and the 2013 Performance Share Plan.
Provident Financial plc also sponsors the Performance Share Plan Trust which was established to operate in conjunction with the Performance Share Plan PSP.
As at 31 December 2014, awards under the PSP, held in the name of the individual subject to the award, were 942,626 2013: 994,627 ordinary shares with a cost of 0.2 m 2013: 0.2m and a market value of 23.2 m 2013: 16.2m.
Provident Financial plc 180 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Financial statements continued Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Share-based payments The group issues share options and awards to senior employees as part of its employee remuneration packages.
The group operates three share schemes: the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, employees savings-related share option schemes typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes SAYE, and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The group also previously operated senior executive share option schemes ESOS SESO, although no options have been granted under these schemes since 2006.
When a share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the current share price, probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
The fair value of all options is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
The charge to the income statement in 2014 was 8.7m for the group 2013: 7.4m and 4.6m for the company 2013: 3.6m.
During 2014, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes 2013: awards options granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes.
The increase in the sharebased payment charge from 7.4m in 2013 to 8.7m in 2014, principally reflects the release of prior year provisions in 2013 following the departure of Chris Gillespie, a former executive director.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK Government bonds.
