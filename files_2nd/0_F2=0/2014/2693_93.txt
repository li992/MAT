The US$6,643 million 31 March 2013 US$5,983 million tax losses include UK capital losses of US$5,421 million 31 March 2013 US$5,006 million.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable that the temporary diff erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary diff erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is US$136 million 31 March 2013 US$198 million.
These temporary diff erences relate to unremitted earnings.
2.8 Discontinued operations The following section outlines what the Group is either holding for sale or has disposed of in the year.
When the Group has assets and liabilities that are likely to be sold rather than being held for continuing use and when accounting standards require, these assets and liabilities are included in current assets and liabilities and denoted as held for sale, rather than in their usual categories.
If they represent a signi cant enough portion of the Group, they are also treated as discontinued operations.
This means that their trading performance is no longer reported in the income statement and are instead reported in a separate line, net of tax, called discontinued operations.
These amounts no longer form part of continuing earnings per share.
Our former Islands businesses and Macau, disposed of during the year, are included in discontinued operations.
We still expect to sell the Seychelles and therefore it remains part of discontinued operations.
On 20 May 2014, we sold Monaco as disclosed in note 5.9.
Accounting policy detailed in note 5.1.
1 Monaco & Islands At a General Meeting on 9 January 2013, shareholders of the Group approved the sale of the Monaco & Islands segment to Batelco International Group Holding Limited Batelco.
The signi cant aspects of this transaction are described below: We entered into an agreement to sell the Islands sub-group, including the Groups interests in operations in the Maldives, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic, Diego Garcia and the Seychelles, for US$580 million.
The sale of the Islands sub-group, with the exception of the Seychelles, was completed on 3 April 2013.
The Group received cash proceeds of US$501 million representing consideration of US$470 million plus US$31 million of proportionate net cash in the businesses attributable to Cable & Wireless Communications: Regulatory approval for the sale of the Seychelles was not obtained and hence the proposed disposal to Batelco could not be completed.
The Groups strategy of focusing on our operations in the Caribbean and Latin America remains unchanged.
We therefore continue to be actively engaged in the disposal of the Seychelles: We also agreed to sell a 25% interest in Compagnie Mongasque fide Communication SAM CMC, the holding company of the Groups interests in Monaco Telecom, for US$100 million.
The sale was completed on 3 April 2013: As part of the transaction we had an option to sell the remaining 75% of CMC shares to Batelco for US$345 million subject to regulatory approval from the Principality of Monaco: Also as part of the transaction, we granted to Batelco a put option over the 25% of CMC shares transferred to Batelco the CMC put option under which Batelco could require, between 18 and 19 months from 3 April 2013, the Group to repurchase the 25% CMC shareholding for US$100 million in the event that the regulatory approval from the Principality of Monaco was not granted within 12 months of 3 April 2013: and The CMC put option was recognised initially as a financial liability note 4.6.
We did not receive regulatory approval for the disposal of the remaining 75% of CMC from the Principality of Monaco.
On 30 December 2013 we therefore agreed with Batelco to unwind the CMC put option and repurchase the 25% interest in CMC.
Monaco did not meet the fide nition of a disposal group held for sale nor the criteria to be classi ed as discontinued operations as there was insuffi cient certainty regarding the completion of a sale process as at 31 March 2014.
The results of Monaco Telecom are disclosed separately in their own operating segment.
The Islands sub-group has been classi ed as a discontinued operation.
The results of the Islands sub-group were previously recorded in the Monaco & Islands operating segment.
The Seychelles continues to be disclosed as a discontinued operation and as a disposal group held for sale in the statement of financial position.
We continue to be actively engaged in the disposal.
