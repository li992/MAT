SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES Year ended 31 December 2014 Ore reserves and mineral resources estimation methods KAZ Minerals The Republic of Kazakhstan inherited the classification system and estimation methods for minerals established by the Former Soviet Union FSU.
Updated Regulations for the Classification of Non-ferrous Metals Reserves became law in Kazakhstan in 2006.
In practice, this means that the statements of resources and reserves developed by KAZ Minerals and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Investment and Development for which adherence to the standardised national system of resources and ore reserves estimation is mandatory.
Mineral deposits are classified according to their degree of geological complexity into one of three deposit categories for copper deposits, which determine the density of exploration sampling and the proportions and classifications of GKZ State Commission on Mineral Reserves reserves that must be estimated.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves are prepared by a Kazakhstan licenced design institute and submitted for approval by the State.
The Conditions for each deposit specify the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties.
Resources and reserves have traditionally been estimated by KAZ Minerals, according to the FSUs Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves.
It is apparent that there is a growing trend towards greater flexibility and discussion with state authorities with respect to resource estimation methods.
This has been reflected in the increased use of computers and associated software by KAZ Minerals in maintaining records about reserves at the operating mines and using databases linked to modelling software to assist in exploration and preliminary resource estimation.
DMT Consulting Ltd DMT recognises this as an important step to achieve verifiable and internally consistent estimates.
For the operating mines, DMT has reviewed the reserves statements of KAZ Minerals and has presented them in accordance with the criteria required to meet JORC standards.
Guidelines on the Alignment of Russian minerals reporting standards and the CRIRSCO Template were published during 2010 as a joint initiative of the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards CRIRSCO and the Russian Federal Government Agency State Commission on Mineral Reserves.
The guidelines have been used to align categories of reserves C2, C1, B and A with appropriate Mineral Resource categories Measured, Indicated and Inferred.
The JORC Competent Person, however, remains responsible for any estimate that is reported.
Mineral Resources, by definition, must have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
In general, therefore, the total active balance reserve, where no unresolvable problems are foreseen, is considered as the Mineral Resource.
Balanced reserves in categories B and C1 are assigned to Measured Mineral Resource and C2 category is assigned to Indicated Mineral Resource.
Ore Reserves in Proved and Probable categories are then converted from the Resources, after consideration of mining plans and after the application of appropriate modifying factors for loss and dilution.
Legal approval for the exploitation of a particular reserve block is also taken into consideration.
For the KAZ Minerals major development projects at Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay, DMT has based the assessment of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves on estimates derived from computer modelling.
The JORC Code specifies that a Pre-feasibility Study is the minimum level of engineering design required before a Mineral Resource can be converted to an Ore Reserve.
Each of these projects is being developed following international best practice, which includes the creation of a computerised geological model linked to an electronic database.
GKZ estimates of tonnage and metal content will continue to be undertaken to comply with national Kazakhstan requirements.
DMT, however, believes that these projects will be best understood by potential investors if the resources and reserves are reported along conventional international lines from the outset, using the JORC, or similar internationally recognised code.
DMTs visit to KAZ Minerals Almaty technical offices for this years audit took place in November 2014.
Mine production is based on December 2014 year-end data.
The assessment of Inferred Resources for KAZ Minerals is incomplete.
The mines do not keep records of prognosticated reserves as defined in Kazakhstan, categories P1, P2 and P3, which may include material that could be considered equivalent to JORC category of Inferred Resources.
Inferred Resources are shown in the tabulations for Aktogay, Bozshakol and Koksay where model based estimates have been used and Inferred Resources have been categorised as such by a competent person under the JORC Code.
All Ore Reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution and refer to estimates of tonnes and contained metal grades at the point of delivery to the processing plant.
Mineral Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of Ore Reserves.
All figures in resources and reserves are in dry metric tonnes and are dated as at 31 December 2014.
2 Includes discounts for ore loss and dilution.
Reserves Resources Ore Loss Dilution.
3 Mine extensions are included within the original ore body as part of operating mines.
No ore loss or dilution has been included.
180 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Revision of ore reserves and mineral resources statement to 31 December 2014 DMT Consulting Ltd DMT or the Consultant has undertaken a review of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates prepared by KAZ Minerals PLC the Company as the basis for the preparation of a statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves as at 31 December 2014.
Tabulations of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, comparisons with the previous annual statement and short technical descriptions are provided for the Companys copper assets.
DMT was known as IMC Group Consulting Limited IMC, prior to renaming in September 2014.
DMTs technical understanding of the mines and projects held by KAZ Minerals is largely based on the Competent Persons Reports that IMC prepared for the Company in 2005, for the London listing, and again in 2010, for the Hong Kong listing.
Additional technical site visits have been made since 2010 when IMC DMT considered them necessary, either to look at new assets or where significant changes have taken place e. g. new exploration drilling.
Technical familiarity with the Companys mines and projects is a critical aspect of the annual review, in support of what is primarily a desktop exercise.
The annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves carried out by DMT is predominantly focused on mine reserve reports, depletion through production, analysis of company plans, new exploration results, new technical reports and other changes affecting the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.
"The Statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is restated in accordance with the criteria of the ""Australasian Code for Reporting Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves"" 2012, published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and collaborating institutions the JORC Code."
The consideration of Mineral Resources is based on the JORC definition which says that a Mineral Resource is an occurrence of minerals in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
In converting Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code, DMT considers a number of Modifying Factors.
Consequently, the code defines an Ore Reserve as the economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
The term economically mineable has no fixed definition in the JORC Code and short-term fluctuations in factors such as metal prices or operating expenditure do not warrant the re-classification from Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources.
If, however, the changes are expected to be long term or permanent in nature, then such re-classification is required.
For the sake of clarity in this report, references to the JORC categories Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource are capitalised.
The noncapitalised term reserve refers to the Kazakh use of the word which can, depending on the context, be synonymous with both JORC terms Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve.
DMT is satisfied, from the audit undertaken, that the recently revised estimates of resources and reserves prepared by the Company for the operating mines, are in accordance with the classification system required by law in the Republic of Kazakhstan and that, correspondingly, the estimates have a consistent basis for expressing the degree of confidence for stating quantities of exploitable minerals at specific grades of metal content.
On the basis of the estimates supplied by the Company, DMT has applied the same technical criteria as used in the 2010 audit, for preparation of the restatement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves as at 31 December 2014, in accordance with the reporting criteria of the JORC Code.
Guidelines for the alignment of Russian minerals reporting standards and the JORC Code were published in 2010 and these have been applied in the preparation of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statement for the operating mines.
This is considered appropriate as all the mineral deposits currently being mined by KAZ Minerals were explored during the Soviet era and reserves approved during that era are still referenced.
The aim of the guidelines is to provide a standard reporting terminology for use in disclosure of the assets of mining companies to stock markets.
