What we have audited The financial statements comprise the accounting policies, the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2014, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and the consolidated and company cash flow statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, the related Notes 1 to 42 on the consolidated financial statements, the related Notes 1 to 16 on the company financial statements and the information identified as audited in the Capital and risk management section of the Business review.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in the accounting policies, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the UK Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors statement on page 99 that the Group is a going concern.
We confirm that: we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements is appropriate: and we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events and conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.

The most significant judgements arise on impairments recorded against loans and advances in RCR 10,946 million and Ulster Bank 2,711 million at 31 December 2014.
As a result of the strategy to exit RCR assets, loan impairments in RCR are particularly sensitive to changes in market conditions.
During the year, 1,320 million was released from RCR impairment provisions following improvements in economic and market conditions, and realisation of collateral at greater than anticipated amounts together with increases in collateral values.

For the IT Where these deficiencies affected applications and databases within the application systems and databases that support financial reporting, the scope of our audit we performed a combination of controls and existence of these deficiencies means there is an increased risk that the substantive testing in order to determine whether we could place reliance data and reports from the affected systems and databases are not reliable.

In addition and where appropriate we extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures.
The description of the risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Group Audit Committee discussed on pages 57 to 61.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 300 million 2013 - 350 million, which was calculated as 0.5% 2013 - 0.6% of the total equity of the Group.
This represented 11% of the Groups loss for the year 2013 - 4% of the Groups loss.
Our materiality in both 2014 and 2013 was based on the equity of the Group given the significant volatility of the Groups profits and losses in recent years.
We agreed with the Group Audit Committee that we would report all audit differences in excess of 10 million, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Group Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
339 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc An overview of the scope of our audit We determined the scope of our audit by first considering the internal organisation of the Group and then identifying the components of the audit that have most significance to the financial statements.
The significant components of our audit are consistent with the operating segments identified in the financial statements comprising UK Personal & Business Banking, Ulster Bank, Commercial Banking, Private Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking, Citizens Financial Group, RCR and the central functions of the Group including Finance both in the UK and overseas, Treasury and Services.
A number of these components consist of a number of different operations with audit work performed in different countries.
Full scope audits were performed of the Groups operations in ten countries, and a further 19 countries were subject to an audit of specified account balances or specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Groups operations at those locations.
The audit work performed across the 29 countries accounted for 99% 2013 - 98% of the Groups total assets and 94% 2013 - 85% of its total revenue.
The Group audit team sent component auditors detailed instructions on audit procedures to be undertaken and the information to be reported back to the Group audit team.
Regular contact was maintained throughout the course of the audit with key component auditors including holding Group planning meetings, regular communications on the status of the audits and a programme of planned visits was followed that was designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visited each significant component audit team a number of times during the year.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

The defined benefit obligation is attributable to the different classes of scheme members in the following proportions Main scheme : 2014 2013 2012 % % % Active 18.8 19.5 23.8 Deferred 41.0 38.4 32.4 Pensioner 40.2 42.1 43.8 100.0 100.0 100.0 Following the legal separation of ABN AMRO Bank N. V. on 1 April 2010, ABN AMROs principal pension scheme in the Netherlands was transferred to the State of the Netherlands.
At 31 December 2009, this scheme had fair value of plan assets of 8.3 billion and present value of defined benefit obligations of 8.3 billion.
The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 December 2009 were: discount rate 5.25%: expected return on plan assets weighted average 5.25%: rate of increase in salaries 2.5%: rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.0%: and inflation assumption 2.0%.
To eliminate this deficit, RBS will pay annual contributions of 650 million from 2014 to 2016 and 450 million indexed in line with inflation from 2017 to 2023.
These contributions are in addition to regular annual contributions of approximately 270 million in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits as well as contributions to meet the expenses of running the scheme.
371 Notes on the consolidated accounts 4 Pensions continued The table below sets out the sensitivities of the pension cost for the year and the present value of defined benefit obligations at 31 December to a change in the principal actuarial assumptions: Main scheme All schemes Decrease increase Decrease increase in pension cost in obligation in pension cost in obligation for year at 31 December for year at 31 December 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 m m m m m m m m m m m m 0.25% increase in the discount rate 67 66 66 1,466 1,187 1,199 79 80 80 1,695 1,379 1,392 0.25% increase in inflation 55 52 60 1,159 895 995 63 58 66 1,334 1,000 1,129 0.25% additional rate of increase in pensions in payment 43 42 39 982 758 690 49 48 45 1,107 844 782 0.25% additional rate of increase in deferred pensions 21 18 20 394 329 297 24 21 23 476 383 342 0.25% additional rate of increase in salaries 9 9 6 100 83 95 12 12 9 131 110 125 Longevity increase of one year 39 35 33 988 728 647 42 39 38 1,053 801 727 Pension costs and liabilities are calculated on the central assumptions and under the relevant sensitivity scenarios.
The sensitivity to pension costs liabilities is the difference between these calculations.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the pension cost or defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
5 Auditors remuneration Amounts paid to the Group's auditors for statutory audit and other services are set out below.
All audit-related and other services are approved by the Group Audit Committee and are subject to strict controls to ensure the external auditors independence is unaffected by the provision of other services.

384 Notes on the consolidated accounts Financial instruments carried at fair value - valuation hierarchy The following tables show financial instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet by valuation hierarchy - level 1, level 2 and level 3.
Examples include G10 government securities, listed equity shares, certain exchange-traded derivatives and certain US agency securities.
Level 2: valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using: a quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active: or b valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuations are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 2 instruments included non-G10 government securities, most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, and certain money market securities and loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.
Level 3: instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data.
Level 3 instruments primarily include cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, certain emerging markets instruments, unlisted equity shares, certain residual interests in securitisations, CDOs, other mortgage-backed products and less liquid debt securities, certain structured debt securities in issue, and OTC derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs such as certain credit and exotic derivatives.
No gain or loss is recognised on the initial recognition of a financial instrument valued using a technique incorporating significant unobservable data.
2 Transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the instruments were transferred.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2.
3 For an analysis of derivatives by type of contract see Capital and risk management Balance Sheet analysis - derivatives, which includes balances relating to disposal groups.
385 Notes on the consolidated accounts 11 Financial instruments - valuation continued The following table analyses level 3 balances and related valuation sensitivities.
Level 3 sensitivities are calculated at a sub-portfolio level and hence these aggregated figures do not reflect the correlation between some of the sensitivities.
In particular, for some portfolios, the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downward movement in one asset would produce an upward movement in another, but due to the additive presentation above, this correlation cannot be shown.
386 Notes on the consolidated accounts Valuation techniques The table below shows a breakdown of valuation techniques and the ranges for those unobservable inputs used in valuation models and techniques that have a material impact on the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments.
The table excludes unobservable inputs where the impact on valuation is less significant.
Movements in the underlying input may have a favourable or unfavourable impact on the valuation depending on the particular terms of the contract and the exposure.
For example an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer and unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst RBS indicates where it considers that there are significant relationships between the inputs, these inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.

2 Price and yield: There may be a range of price based information used to value an instrument.
This may be a direct comparison of one instrument or portfolio with another or movements in a more liquid instrument may be used to indicate the movement in the value of less liquid instrument.
The comparison may also be indirect in that adjustments are made to the price to reflect differences between the pricing source and the instrument being valued, for example different maturity, credit quality, seniority or expected payouts.
Similarly to price, an instruments yield may be compared to other instruments either directly or indirectly.
Prices move inversely to yields.
3 Recovery rate: Reflects market expectations about the return of principal for a debt instrument or other obligations after a credit event or on liquidation.
Recovery rates tend to move conversely to credit spreads.
4 Credit spreads and discount margins: Credit spreads and margins express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the credit risk associated with a cash instrument.
A higher credit spread would indicate that the underlying instrument has more credit risk associated with it.
Consequently, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the higher risk.
The discount rate comprises credit spread or margin plus the benchmark rate: it is used to value future cash flows.
5 Correlation: Measures the degree by which two prices or other variables are observed to move together.
If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation: if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation.
Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket a group of separate assets, exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.
6 Volatility: A measure of the tendency of a price to change with time.
7 RBS does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.
The Level 3 sensitivities above are calculated at a trade or low level Where markets are liquid or very liquid, little judgment is required.
They are not calculated on an overall portfolio basis and However, when the information regarding the liquidity in a particular therefore do not reflect the likely potential uncertainty on the portfolio as a market is not clear, a judgment may need to be made.
The figures are aggregated and do not reflect the correlated difficult as assessing the liquidity of a market is not always nature of some of the sensitivities.
In particular, for some of the portfolios straightforward.
For an equity traded on an exchange, daily volumes of the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downwards trading can be seen, but for an over-the counter OTC derivative movement in one asset would produce an upwards movement in another, assessing the liquidity of the market with no central exchange is more but due to the additive presentation of the above figures this correlation difficult.

Of the 3.7 billion cumulative charge, 3.4 billion relates to redress and 0.3 billion to administrative expenses.
The principal assumptions underlying the Groups provision in respect of PPI sales are: assessment of the total number of complaints that the Group will receive: the proportion of these that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of the Groups portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in FSA policy statements and the expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and FSA calculation rules.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.

Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to the Group of administering the redress process.
The Group expects the majority of the cash outflows associated with the remaining provision to have occurred by Q2 2016.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, take up and uphold rates and average redress costs.
Background information in relation to PPI claims is given in Note 32.
2 The Group has estimated 1,435 million for its liability in respect of the sale of Interest Rate Hedging Products based on experience, having now agreed all outcomes with the independent skilled person appointed to review all decisions.
The provision includes redress that will be paid to customers, consequential loss including interest on customer redress, the cost to the Group of exiting the hedging positions and the cost of undertaking the review.
In 2014, the Group increased its provision by 185 million 2013 - 550 million: 2012 - 700 million, principally reflecting a marginal increase in redress experience compared to expectations and the cost of a small number of consequential loss claims over and above interest offered as part of basic redress payments.
The outcomes of all cases have now been agreed with the independent skilled person appointed to review all decisions.
The cumulative charge for IRHP is 1.4 billion, of which 1.1 billion relates to redress and 0.3 billion to administrative expenses.
The principal assumptions underlying the Groups provision are: the proportion of relevant customers with interest rate caps that will ask to be included in the review the type of consequential loss claims that will be received movements in market rates that will impact the cost of closing out legacy hedging positions the cost of the review Uncertainties remain over the number of transactions that will qualify for redress and the nature and cost of that redress, including the cost of consequential loss claims.
Background information in relation to Interest Rate Hedging Products claims is given in Note 32.
3 The Group has provided for other customer redress, primarily in relation to investment advice in retail and private banking 190 million and packaged accounts 150 million.
4 On 6 February 2013, the Group reached agreement with the FSA, the US Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in relation to the setting of LIBOR and other trading rates, including financial penalties of 381 million.
In December 2013, the Group agreed to pay settlement penalties of approximately 260 million and 131 million to resolve investigations by the European Commission into Yen LIBOR competition infringements and EURIBOR competition infringements respectively.
For further details see Note 32.
5 The Group is party to certain legal proceedings and regulatory investigations and continues to co-operate with a number of regulators.
All such matters are periodically reassessed with the assistance of external professional advisers, where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability and to evaluate the extent to which a reliable estimate of any liability can be made.
An additional charge of 820 million was booked in 2014 2013 - 124 million: 2012 - 75 million, primarily relating to investigations into the foreign exchange market, regulatory fines in connection with the June 2012 technology incident and other conduct and regulatory matters.
Details of these investigations and a discussion of the nature of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 32.
6 Arising out of its normal business operations, the Group is party to legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the United States and other jurisdictions.
An additional charge of 2,050 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of greater levels of certainty on expected outcomes, primarily in respect of mortgage-backed securities and securities-related litigation following third party settlements and regulatory decisions.
Detailed descriptions of the Groups legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 32.
7 The property provisions principally comprise provisions for onerous lease contracts.
Provision is made for future rentals payable in respect of vacant leasehold property and for any shortfall where leased property is sub-let at a rental lower than the lease rentals payable by the Group.
