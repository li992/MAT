Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to BTs pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.
At 31 March 2014, all of the deferred tax asset of 1,460m 2012 13: 1,438m and all of the deferred tax liability of 829m 2012 13: 1,209m are expected to be recovered or settled after more than one year.
Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 23% to 21% on 1 April 2014 and will change to 20% on 1 April 2015.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2014 have been calculated using a rate of 20%.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 208m and as a specic item in the income statement note 8 and a deferred tax expense of 288m in reserves.
