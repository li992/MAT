Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in April 2010, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for certain future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, for which no provision has been made, have been disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The cumulative pre-tax income statement charge since the incident amounts to $43.5 billion.
For more information on the types of expenditure included in the cumulative income statement charge, see Impact upon the group income statement below.
The cumulative income statement charge does not include amounts for obligations that BP considers are not possible, at this time, to measure reliably.
For further information, including developments in relation to the interpretation of business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement and the measurement of the penalty obligation under the Clean Water Act, see Provisions and contingent liabilities below.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all the obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors, as discussed under Provisions and contingent liabilities below, including in relation to any new information or future developments.
These could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The risks associated with the incident could also heighten the impact of the other risks to which the group is exposed as further described under Risk factors on page 48 and Legal proceedings on page 228.
The impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are included within the relevant line items in those statements and are shown in the table below.

Trust fund BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust in 2010, to be funded in the amount of $20 billion, to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
The Trust is available to fund the qualified settlement funds QSFs established under the terms of the settlement agreements comprising the Economic and Property Damages EPD Settlement Agreement and the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement with the PSC administered through the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP see Provisions and contingent liabilities below for further information.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
The funding of the Trust was completed in 2012.
The obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was recognized in full in 2010 and charged to the income statement.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds.
An asset has been recognized representing BPs right to receive reimbursement from the trust fund.
This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP will not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 111 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued payments will be made directly from the trust fund, and BP will be released from its corresponding obligation.
The reimbursement asset is recorded within Trade and other receivables on the balance sheet apportioned between current and non-current elements.
The net increase in the provision for items covered by the trust fund of $662 million relates principally to business economic loss claims as well as increases in the provision for claims administration costs.
During the year, cumulative charges to be paid by the Trust reached $20 billion.
Subsequent additional costs, over and above those provided within the $20 billion, are being expensed to the income statement as incurred.
At 31 December 2014, $3,855 million of the provisions and payables are eligible to be paid from the Trust.
The table below shows movements in the reimbursement asset during the period to 31 December 2014.

A further $500-million partial distribution from the seafood compensation fund has been recommended and disbursement of funds commenced in early 2015.
The portion of the provision and reimbursement asset that related to the seafood compensation fund were derecognized upon funding of the seafood compensation fund QSF in 2012.
The EPD Settlement Agreement with the PSC provides for a court-supervised settlement programme which commenced operation on 4 June 2012.
See Provisions below for further information on the current status of the EPD Settlement Agreement.
A separate claims administrator has been appointed to pay medical claims and to implement other aspects of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement.
For further information on the PSC settlements, see Legal proceedings on page 228.
Other payables BP reached an agreement with the US government in 2012, which was approved by the court in 2013, to resolve all federal criminal claims arising from the incident.
Under the agreement, BP agreed to pay $4 billion over a period of five years.
At 31 December 2014, the remaining criminal claims payable, within Other payables, was $2,995 million, of which $595 million falls due in 2015.
BP also reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in 2012, resolving the SECs Gulf of Mexico oil spill-related civil claims.
As part of the settlement, BP agreed to a civil penalty of $525 million, with the final instalment paid during 2014.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions BP has recorded provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in relation to environmental expenditure including spill response costs, litigation and claims, and Clean Water Act penalties that can be measured reliably at this time.
Movements in each class of provision during the year and cumulatively since the incident are presented in the tables below.

In 112 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 Financial statements 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued addition, BP faces claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 for natural resource damages.
These damages include, among other things, the reasonable costs of assessing the injury to natural resources.
During 2011, BP entered into a framework agreement with natural resource trustees for the United States and five Gulf-coast states, providing for up to $1 billion to be spent on early restoration projects to address natural resource injuries resulting from the oil spill, to be funded from the $20-billion trust fund.
In 2012, work began on the initial set of early restoration projects identified under this framework and during 2014, Phase 3 of the early restoration projects was formally agreed, comprising $627 million of approved project spend of which $563 million has been paid.
At 31 December 2014, the remaining amount provided for natural resource damage assessment costs and early restoration projects was $798 million.
Until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining natural resource damages claims other than the assessment and early restoration costs noted above, therefore no additional amounts have been provided for these items and they are disclosed as a contingent liability.
Litigation and claims The litigation and claims provision includes amounts that can be estimated reliably for the future cost of settling claims by individuals and businesses for damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources Individual and Business Claims, and claims by state and local government entities for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs, under OPA 90 and other legislation State and Local Claims, except as described under Contingent liabilities below.
Claims administration costs and legal costs, including legal costs under indemnification agreements, have also been provided for.
The timing of payment of litigation and claims provisions classified as non-current is dependent upon ongoing legal activity and is therefore uncertain.
BP has provided for its best estimate of the cost associated with the PSC settlement agreements with the exception of the cost of business economic loss claims, which are provided for where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
As disclosed in BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2013, as part of its monitoring of payments made by the DHCSSP, BP identified multiple business economic loss claim determinations that appeared to result from an interpretation of the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement EPD Settlement Agreement by the claims administrator that BP believes was incorrect.
During 2014, there were various rulings on matters relating to the interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement, in particular on the issue of matching revenue and expenses as well as causation requirements of the EPD Settlement Agreement.
In March 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district courts ruling that the EPD Settlement Agreement contained no causation requirement beyond the revenue and related tests set out in an exhibit to that agreement.
In March 2014, BP filed a petition that all the active judges of the Fifth Circuit review the decision: in May 2014 this was denied.
The district court dissolved the injunction that had halted the processing and payment of business economic loss claims and instructed the claims administrator to resume the processing and payment of claims.
BP sought review by the US Supreme Court Supreme Court of the Fifth Circuits decisions relating to compensation of claims for losses with no apparent connection to the Deepwater Horizon spill.
In December 2014, the Supreme Court declined to review BPs petition.
As a result, the final deadline for filing claims in the Economic and Property Damages Settlement is 8 June 2015.
Management believes that no reliable estimate can currently be made of any business economic loss claims i not yet received: ii received, but not yet processed: or iii processed, but not yet paid, except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
The inability to estimate reliably such claims is due to uncertainty regarding both the volume of such claims and the average value per claim.
In respect of uncertainty regarding the volume of claims, in December 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear BPs appeal of the district court ruling that the EPD Settlement Agreement contained no causation requirement beyond the revenue and related tests set forth in that agreement.
This resolution, however, does not reduce uncertainty in the short term regarding the volume of claims, since it is possible that additional claims will be made.
In addition, a claims submission deadline of 8 June 2015 has now been set, which may lead to an increase in the rate of claims received until the deadline, compounding managements inability to estimate the total volume of claims that will be made.
In respect of uncertainty regarding the average value per claim, a small proportion of the filed claims have been determined under the revised policy for the matching of revenue and expenses for business economic loss claims introduced in May 2014 and disputes, disagreements, and uncertainties regarding the proper application of the revised policy to particular claims and categories of claims continue to arise as the claims administrator has begun applying the revised policy.
Furthermore, there have been no, or only a small number of, claim determinations made under some of the specialized frameworks that have been put in place for particular industries and so determinations to date may not be representative of the total population of claims.
In addition, due to a data secrecy order, detailed data about claims that have not yet been determined is not currently available to BP and so it is not possible to review claim demographics or identify potential populations for each category of claim.
There is therefore very little data to build up a track record of claims determinations under the policies and protocols that are now being applied following resolution of the matching and causation issues.
We therefore cannot estimate future trends of the number and proportion of claims that will be determined to be eligible, nor can we estimate the value of such claims.
A provision for such business economic loss claims will be established when these uncertainties are resolved and a reliable estimate can be made of the liability.
The current estimate for the total cost of those elements of the PSC settlement that BP considers can be reliably estimated is $9.9 billion.
The DHCSSP has issued eligibility notices, most of which are disputed by BP, in respect of business economic loss claims of approximately $400 million which have not been provided for.
The majority of these claims are being re-assessed using the new matching policy.
Furthermore, a significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed, and further claims are likely to be received.
The total cost of the PSC settlement is likely to be significantly higher than the amount recognized to date of $9.9 billion because the current estimate does not reflect business economic loss claims not yet received, or received but not yet processed, or processed but not yet paid, except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility.
The provision recognized for litigation and claims includes an estimate for State and Local Claims.
Although the provision recognized is BPs current reliable best estimate of the amount required to settle these obligations, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the outcome of any litigation proceedings and the amount of claims that will become payable by BP.
Significant uncertainties exist in relation to the amount of claims that are to be paid and will become payable, including claims payable under the DHCSSP and State and Local Claims.
There is significant uncertainty in relation to the amounts that ultimately will be paid in relation to current claims, and the number, type and amounts payable for claims not yet reported as described above and in Legal proceedings on page 228 and the outcomes of any further litigation including in relation to potential opt-outs from the PSC settlement or otherwise.
There is also uncertainty as to the cost of administering the claims process under the DHCSSP and in relation to future legal costs.
See Legal proceedings on page 228 and Contingent liabilities below for further details.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 113 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Clean Water Act penalties A provision of $3,510 million was recognized in 2010 for estimated civil penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
At the time the provision for the Clean Water Act penalty was made, the number of barrels of oil spilled was determined by using the mid-point 47,500 barrels per day of the range of estimates 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day from the intra-agency Flow Rate Technical Group created by the National Incident Commander in charge of the spill response.
The initial estimate of 3.2 million barrels was calculated using a total flow of 47,500 barrels per day multiplied by the 85 days from 22 April 2010 to 15 July 2010 less an estimate of the amount captured on the surface approximately 850,000 barrels.
This estimated discharge volume was then multiplied by $1,100 per barrel the maximum amount the statute allows in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct for the purposes of estimating a potential penalty.
This resulted in a provision of $3,510 million for potential penalties under Section 311.
The estimates of cumulative discharge presented by experts testifying in the Phase 2 trial varied significantly.
In January 2015, the district court issued its decision in the Phase 2 trial that 3.19 million barrels of oil were discharged into the Gulf of Mexico and therefore subject to a Clean Water Act penalty.
This amount is consistent with the number of barrels BP has used to calculate the provision.
In addition, the district court found that BP was not grossly negligent in its source control efforts.
BP and other parties to the proceedings have filed notices of appeal of the Phase 2 ruling and therefore the findings from the Phase 2 trial remain subject to uncertainty.
In September 2014, the district court issued its decision in the Phase 1 trial that the discharge of oil was the result of the gross negligence and wilful misconduct of BP Exploration & Production Inc. BPXP and that BPXP is therefore subject to enhanced civil penalties.
The statutory maximum penalty is up to $4,300 per barrel of oil discharged where gross negligence or wilful misconduct is proven.
BP does not believe that the evidence at trial supports a finding of gross negligence and wilful misconduct and in December 2014 filed notice of appeal of the Phase 1 ruling.
As a result of the September 2014 district court ruling that the discharge of oil was the result of BPs gross negligence and wilful misconduct, the Clean Water Act penalty obligation is not considered to be reliably measurable and it is therefore no longer possible to determine a best estimate of the Clean Water Act penalty provision.
Under IFRS, a provision is reversed when it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
With regard to the Clean Water Act penalty obligation, it continues to be probable that there will be an outflow of resources and therefore, in the absence of the ability to identify the best estimate of the liability, the previously recognized provision of $3,510 million has been maintained.
Note 1 Provisions, contingencies and reimbursement assets identifies the significant accounting estimates and judgements made in relation to the Clean Water Act provision.
BP continues to believe that a provision of $3,510 million represents a reliable estimate of the amount of the liability if the appeal is successful.
If BP is unsuccessful in its appeal, and the ruling of gross negligence and wilful misconduct is upheld, the maximum penalty that could be imposed is up to $4,300 per barrel.
Based upon this penalty rate and the district courts ruling on the number of barrels spilled, which, as noted above is also subject to appeal, the maximum penalty could be up to $13.7 billion.
However, in assessing the amount of the penalty, the court is directed to consider the following statutory penalty factors: the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
The court has wide discretion in deciding how to apply these factors to determine the penalty and what weighting to ascribe to different factors.
BP is therefore unable to ascribe probabilities to possible outcomes within the range of potential penalties and cannot determine a reliable estimate for any additional penalty which might apply should the gross negligence finding be upheld.
The trial phase to determine the amount of the Clean Water Act penalty commenced on 20 January 2015.
The amount that may become payable by BP is subject to a very high level of uncertainty since it will depend on the outcome of BPs appeals as well as what is determined by the district court with respect to the application of statutory penalty factors as noted above.
The court has wide discretion in the application of statutory penalty factors.
The timing of any payment is also uncertain.
Given the significant uncertainty, the very wide range of possible outcomes if BP is unsuccessful in this appeal of the September ruling, and the inability to ascribe probabilities to possible outcomes within the range, management is not able to estimate reliably any further liability for the Clean Water Act penalty arising in the event that BP is not successful in its appeal.
A contingent liability is therefore disclosed.
See Contingent liabilities below for further information.
Provision movements The total amount recognized as an increase in provisions during the year was $1,327 million.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $2,071 million, including payments from the trust fund of $1,681 million and payments made directly by BP of $390 million 2013 $3,777 million, including payments from the trust fund of $3,051 million and payments made directly by BP of $726 million, and after adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2014 was $8,605 million 2013 $9,346 million.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP for all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors.
Furthermore, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
The amount and timing of any amounts payable could also be impacted by any further settlements which may or may not occur.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably.
Contingent liabilities BP has provided for its best estimate of amounts expected to be paid that can be measured reliably.
It is not possible, at this time, to measure reliably other obligations arising from the incident, nor is it practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Therefore, no amounts have been provided for these obligations as at 31 December 2014.
114 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2014 Financial statements 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Natural resource damage claims As described above in Provisions, a provision has been made for natural resource damage assessment and early restoration projects under the $1-billion framework agreement.
Natural resource damages resulting from the oil spill are currently being assessed.
BP and the federal and state trustees are collecting extensive data in order to assess the extent of damage to wildlife, shoreline, near shore and deepwater habitats, and recreational uses, among other things.
The study data will inform an assessment of injury to the Gulf Coast natural resources and the development of a restoration plan to address the identified injuries.
Detailed analysis and interpretation continue on the data that have been collected.
Any early restoration projects undertaken pursuant to the $1-billion framework agreement could mitigate the total damages resulting from the incident.
Accordingly, until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining natural resource damage claims and associated legal costs, therefore no such amounts have been provided as at 31 December 2014. Business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement BP identified multiple business economic loss claim determinations under the PSC settlement that appeared to result from an interpretation of the EPD Settlement Agreement by the claims administrator that BP believes was incorrect.
The potential cost of business economic loss claims not yet received, processed and paid except where an eligibility notice had been issued before the end of the month following the balance sheet date and is not subject to appeal by BP within the claims facility is not provided for and is disclosed as a contingent liability.
A significant number of business economic loss claims have been received but have not yet been processed and paid and further claims are likely to be received.
See Provisions above for further information.
State and Local claims As described above in Provisions, a provision has been made for State and Local claims that can be measured reliably.
The States of Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana and Texas submitted or asserted claims to BP under OPA 90 for alleged losses including economic losses and property damage as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The amounts claimed, certain of which include punitive damages or other multipliers, are very substantial.
However, BP considers these claims unsubstantiated and the methodologies used to calculate these claims to be seriously flawed, not supported by OPA 90, not supported by documentation, and to substantially overstate the claims.
Similar claims have also been submitted by various local government entities and a foreign government under OPA 90.
The amounts alleged in the submissions for these State and Local Claims total approximately $35 billion.
BP will defend vigorously against these claims if adjudicated at trial: the timing of any outflow of resources in relation to State and Local claims is dependent on the timing of the court process in relation to these claims.
Clean Water Act penalties A provision has been maintained for BPs obligation under the Clean Water Act, as described above in Provisions.
Any obligation in relation to any further liability for the Clean Water Act penalty arising in the event that BP is not successful in its appeal of the Phase 1 ruling is disclosed as a contingent liability.
The trial phase to determine the amount of the Clean Water Act penalty commenced in January 2015 and post-trial briefing is scheduled to complete in April 2015.
BP does not know when the district court will rule on the Penalty Phase of the trial and so the timing of any payment continues to be uncertain.
Securities-related litigation Proceedings relating to securities class actions MDL 2185 pending in federal court in Texas, including a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of American Depositary Shares under US federal securities law, are continuing.
A jury trial is scheduled to begin in January 2016 and the timing of any outflow of resources, if any, is dependent on the duration of the court process.
No reliable estimate can be made of the amounts that may be payable in relation to these proceedings, if any, so no provision has been recognized at 31 December 2014.
In addition, no reliable estimate can be made of the amounts that may be payable in relation to any other securities litigation, if any, so no provision has been recognized at 31 December 2014.
Other litigation In addition to the State and Local claims and securities class actions described above, BP is named as a defendant in approximately 3,000 other civil lawsuits brought by individuals, corporations and government entities in US federal and state courts, as well as certain non-US jurisdictions, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and the spill response efforts.
Further actions are likely to be brought.
Among other claims, these lawsuits assert claims for personal injury or wrongful death in connection with the accident and the spill response, commercial and economic injury, damage to real and personal property, breach of contract and violations of statutes, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of US securities and environmental statutes.
In addition, claims have been received, primarily from business claimants, under OPA 90 in relation to the 2010 federal deepwater drilling moratoria.
Until further fact and expert disclosures occur, court rulings clarify the issues in dispute, liability and damage trial activity nears or progresses, or other actions such as further possible settlements occur, it is not possible given these uncertainties to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of the liabilities that may accrue to BP in connection with or as a result of these lawsuits, nor it is possible to determine the timing of any payment that may arise.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items as at 31 December 2014.
It is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to other litigation or potential fines and penalties.
There are a number of federal and state environmental and other provisions of law, other than the Clean Water Act, under which one or more governmental agencies could seek civil fines and penalties from BP.
For example, a complaint filed by the United States sought to reserve the ability to seek penalties and other relief under a number of other laws.
Given the unsubstantiated nature of certain claims that may be asserted, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any such claims would be successful or what penalties or fines would be assessed.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items.
Settlement and other agreements Under the settlement agreements with Anadarko and MOEX, and with Cameron International, the designer and manufacturer of the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer, BP has agreed to indemnify Anadarko, MOEX and Cameron for certain claims arising from the accident.
It is therefore possible that BP may face claims under these indemnities, but it is not currently possible to reliably measure, nor identify the timing of, any obligation in relation to such claims and therefore no amount has been provided as at 31 December 2014.
There are also agreements indemnifying certain thirdparty contractors in relation to litigation costs and certain other claims.
A contingent liability is also disclosed in relation to other obligations under these agreements.
The magnitude and timing of all possible obligations in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill continue to be subject to a very high degree of uncertainty as described further in Risk factors on page 48.
Any such possible obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Furthermore, other material unanticipated obligations may arise in future in relation to the incident.
