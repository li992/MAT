Intangible assets continued Impairment testing Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each country in which it has operations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The main assumptions used when performing the impairment test are set out below.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets for 2015 and forecasts for 2016 and 2017 approved by the Board.
Cash ows beyond 2017 are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2013: 2.5% for all CGUs apart from Turkey which is discussed separately below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the operating segment in which the CGU operates.
The pre-tax discount rate used was 10.5% 2013: 10.2% for all CGUs apart from Turkey, as described below.
The discount rates used are adjusted for estimated tax cash flows and reect specic risks relating to the relevant segments.
For all CGUs apart from Turkey, goodwill impairment testing demonstrated that value in use comfortably exceeded the carrying value of the assets tested and that no reasonably possible change to the assumptions used would result in an indication of impairment.
The above methodology when applied to the Turkish CGU indicated impairment and therefore a more detailed calculation was performed.
Due to the integration of the Turkish business taking longer than initially anticipated, the future cash flows have been revised accordingly.
The value in use of the Turkish CGU was calculated by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 16.3% to these cash flows.
The elevated discount rate reflects the heightened probability of future cash flows differing from the current forecast.
A growth rate of 4.1% was applied to the cash flows beyond 2017, reflecting the long term macro-economic expectations in Turkey.
When the tailored assumptions were applied to the Turkish CGU, the carrying value was found to exceed the value in use by 9.6m, resulting in an impairment charge of this amount which has been reported as an exceptional item, and relates to the RoE segment.
Following the impairment, goodwill of 3.0m remains allocated to the Turkish CGU.
An increase of 100bps to the discount rate would result in an increase of 1.1m to the impairment charge, and an increase of 100bps to the growth rate would result in a reduction of 1.7m to the charge.
A segment-level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below: Year ended 31 December 2013 Year ended 31 December 2014 Rest of UK Rest of Europe Total UK Europe Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Goodwill 42,454 69,762 112,216 42,454 84,356 126,810 The Group assesses at each reporting date whether its customer contracts intangible assets may be impaired.
If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment loss is recognised.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises their purchase cost, together with the costs of installation and directly attributable external and internal costs, such as staff and property rentals, incurred during the construction or commissioning phase.
Additions to property, plant and equipment also include capitalised finance costs.
When property, plant and equipment is acquired as part of a business combination, the cost of such assets is deemed to be their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The principal periods over which assets are depreciated are: Freehold land and buildings Freehold land is not depreciated, freehold property is depreciated over 50 years Leasehold improvements 730 years straight-line Plant and machinery 520 years straight-line Ofce equipment 35 years straight-line Depreciation of the above assets is calculated from the date an asset becomes available for use, so as to write off the difference between the cost and the residual value over its expected useful economic life.
The expected period of the property leases in which an asset is located is taken into account when determining the useful economic life of the asset.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are operational.
At this time such assets are transferred into the appropriate asset class and depreciated over the expected useful economic lives referred to above.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if appropriate, adjusted on a prospective basis.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
After initial measurement, any subsequent adjustments to dilapidations provisions are normally recorded against the original amount included in leasehold improvements with a corresponding adjustment to future depreciation charges.
