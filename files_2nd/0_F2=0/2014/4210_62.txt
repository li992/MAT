Croda International Plc Sharesave Scheme Sharesave The Sharesave scheme, established in 1983 and renewed in 2013, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three to five years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under IFRS 2 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
