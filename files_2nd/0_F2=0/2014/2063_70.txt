While the opportunity to draw upon this credit facilityexpires within one year, drawn funds are repaid in equal semi-annual instalments commencing after more than one year and ending after more than five years.
18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TREASURY INSTRUMENTS The Group is exposed to credit risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and liquidity risk.
As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the fixed and floating composition of its debt.
The Group enters into currency exchange rate derivatives to hedge certain currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest or currency exchange rate derivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 41.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity inaccordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain gas sales contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities andindices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
BG GROUP | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 118 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 andare recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity-based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not part ofa hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet within Other commodity derivatives at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 34 to 41.

The amounts in respect of other commodity derivatives represent thegross combination of notional principals relating to all purchase and sale contracts and accordingly do not show the extent to which these contracts may offset.
These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that the Groupis exposed to from their use.
BG GROUP | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 119 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED VALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market prices and yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based onobservable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, certain gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
These contracts contain an underlying linkage to oil prices, and one of the assumptions used for their valuation is that observable commodity prices are liquid for four years 2013: four years.
The fair values of the commodity contracts are calculated using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

A reasonably foreseeable change in the valuation assumptions underlying other commodity derivatives would not significantly change their fair value measurement.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING In line with the Groups risk management policies, certain derivative and non-derivative instruments are designated as hedges of currency, interest rateand commodity price exposures in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2014, the Group held a number of interest rate derivatives and cross-currency interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they arean effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2014 is $ 8 m 2013: $66m.
During 2014, adjustments of $ 26 m 2013: $65m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives, interest rate derivatives and cross-currency interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows and currency exposure on Group debt.
As at 31 December 2014, an unrealised pre-tax loss of $42m 2013: $4m was deferred in other comprehensive income in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 19 years 2013: 24 years and the associated gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2014, deferred pre-tax losses of $13m 2013: $nil are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2014 is $ 30 m 2013: $174m.

These items are reported within the income statement to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2014, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments inforeign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset the gains or losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2014 is $45m 2013: $529m gain.
The fair value of financial instruments designated ashedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2014 is $ 5 682 m 2013: $ 5 681 m.

In the absence of such a requirement, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however, each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreement will be required or have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
Per the terms of each agreement, anevent of default includes: failure by a party to make payment when due: failure by a party to perform any obligation required by the agreement other than payment if such failure is not remedied within a specified cure period after notice of such failure is given to the party: or bankruptcy.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidity risk.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the following sections.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures reduce liquidity risk.
The Group proposes to meet its financing commitments from the operating cash flows of the business, existing cash and cash equivalent investments, proceeds from asset disposals and borrowings from a range of sources which are expected to include money and debt capital markets, government lending agencies and existing committed lines of credit.
The undiscounted contractual cash flows receivable payable under financial instruments as at the balance sheet date are as follows: The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2014 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 2 251 1 737 6 083 24 231 34 302 Short-term payables 1 509 1 509 3 760 1 737 6 083 24 231 35 811 Outflows from derivative financial instruments Currency and interest rate derivatives 310 327 4 963 4 254 9 854 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 213 291 559 234 2 297 Net-settled commodity derivatives 5 5 1 528 618 5 522 4 488 12 156 Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 9 197 1 438 5 560 4 490 20 685 Total as at 31 December 2014 3 909 917 6 045 24 229 27 282 The Group Between Between as at 31 December 2013 Within one and two and After one year two years five years five years Total $m $m $m $m $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 1 150 1 977 6 864 25 750 35 741 Short-term payables 1 878 1 878 3 028 1 977 6 864 25 750 37 619 Outflows from derivative financial instruments a Currency and interest rate derivatives 374 317 3 898 3 612 8 201 Gross-settled commodity derivatives 1 232 397 276 1 905 Net-settled commodity derivatives 49 17 12 78 1 655 731 4 186 3 612 10 184 a Non-derivative financial assets and inflows from derivative financial instruments 12 172 1 728 4 701 4 582 23 183 a Total as at 31 December 2013 7 489 980 6 349 24 780 24 620 a The Group has amended the comparative disclosures in order to present both principal and interest settlement amounts gross where the pay and receive legs of a derivative will be settled separately, including currency exchange, interest rate and cross-currency interest rate derivatives.
BG GROUP | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 123 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, aswell as credit exposures of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are normally accepted as a counterparty and credit limits are established based primarily on the credit ratings, although other credit assessment factors that determine credit quality, including the external environment, are taken into account when considering the awarding of or maintenance of a limit.
Similarly if a commercial counterparty is independently credit rated, the rating is primarily used to determine credit quality and limits, with other relevant assessment factors also considered.
Ifthere is no independent credit rating, credit quality is assessed in accordance with credit policies that take account of the counterpartys financial position and other similar factors.
Exposures are monitored by the relevant Group businesses and at a Group level.
As at 31 December 2014, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under currency and interest rate related derivatives was $167m 2013: $570m and commodity related derivatives $79m 2013: $65m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group considers its portfolio for credit related concentration risks where risks may result from strategic investments, commercial relationships or sales of product in a variety of locations.
Mitigation may be considered where appropriate to diversify or reduce risk profile.
The Egyptian government continues to demonstrate its commitment to repay outstanding debts to the energy industry.
Following partial repayments of the Groups outstanding debt during 2014, the amount owed by Egypt General Petroleum Corporation EGPC in respect of domestic gas sales as at 31 December 2014 was $0.9bn 2013: $1.2bn, of which $0.7bn 2013: $0.5bn was overdue.
The Group considers that the current receivable balance remains fully recoverable as direct cash payments from EGPC continue to be received, however in 2014 a $100 million pre-tax $79 million post-tax charge was recognised relating to the downward re-measurement of the receivable balance to reflect the time value of money associated with the outstanding debt based on a revised assumed repayment profile.
The recoverability of the receivable balance depends on the business environment in Egypt, the Groups continued investment plans and the volume of gas available for export, together with the outcome of ongoing negotiations with EGPC.
Market risk Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.
The principal market variables that affect the value of these financial instruments are UK and US interest rates, US Dollar to Pound Sterling exchange rates, UK and US gas prices, and Japan Custom-cleared Crude JCC and Brent oil prices.
The table below illustrates the indicative post-tax effects on the income statement and other comprehensive income of applying reasonably foreseeable market movements to the Groups financial instruments at the balance sheet date.

The Group has amended the comparative disclosures for foreign exchange rate sensitivities reported in 2013 from a $144m loss to a $208m loss for disposals, re-measurements and impairments and from a $357m gain to a $1 635 gain for other comprehensive income.
The above sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups financial assets, liabilities and hedge designations as at the balance sheet date and indicates theeffect of a reasonable increase in each market variable.
The effect of a corresponding decrease in these variables is approximately equal and opposite.
The following assumptions have been made: i the sensitivity includes a full years change in interest payable and receivable from floating rate borrowings and investments based on thepost-swap amounts and composition as at the balance sheet date: ii fair value changes from derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are considered fully effective and are recorded in other comprehensive income: iii fair value changes from derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are considered fully effective and entirely offset by adjustments tothe underlying hedged item: and iv fair value changes from derivatives not in a hedge relationship are recorded in the income statement.
