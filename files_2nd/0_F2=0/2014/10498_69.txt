Detail of annual bonus awarded in the year Name Awarded in cash Awarded in shares Total David Hathorn 739,369 739,369 1,478,738 Andrew King 357,215 357,215 714,430 Peter Oswald 491,892 491,892 983,784 Clawback The Committee considered whether there were any circumstances in the year that would have required clawback and agreed that such circumstances did not exist.
Under Mondis LTIP and BSP rules clawback can be applied to awards made on or after 1 January 2011 if there has been a misstatement of financial results, or performance outcomes that are relevant to the Plans, that had the effect that awards were larger than they would have been had such errors not been made.
Clawback may, at the Committees discretion, take the form of a demand for the participant to repay amounts to Mondi, a reduction of future bonus payments to the participant, and a reduction in the number of conditional share awards held by a participant.
Clawback applies to misstatement of results or miscalculation of relevant performance conditions.
In the case of employment termination Mondi is able to cancel subsisting but unvested share awards, withhold payments that would otherwise be due to the participant, and, where appropriate, initiate legal proceedings to recover funds to which the Group is legally entitled.
