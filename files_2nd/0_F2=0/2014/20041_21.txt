Fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments related to foreign exchange forward contracts and options taken out to hedge against foreign currency movements when sales and purchases are denominated in foreign currencies see Note 41, Financial instruments and related disclosures.
In 2014 this included an unrealised loss of 299 million arising from the loss position of a number of forward exchange contracts entered into following announcement of the proposed Novartis transaction to protect the Sterling value of the net US Dollar proceeds due to the Group on completion of the transaction.
If these contracts remain in a loss position on maturity, that loss will partly offset the gain in the expected Sterling value of the proceeds that will be received by the Group as a result of favourable exchange movements since the inception of the forward contracts.
If, on maturity, the contracts are in a gain position, the gains will partly offset losses in the Sterling value of the proceeds that will be received by the Group as a result of unfavourable exchange movements since the inception of the forward contracts.

In 2013, a 234 million deferred tax charge related to the unwinding of deferred profit in inventory arising from reorganisations of intellectual property ownership and supply chain restructuring was presented within differences in overseas tax rates.
This impact has now been presented as restructuring for 2013 as this better reects the nature of this item.
The Group qualies for intellectual property incentives such as patent box regimes in a number of countries.
The permanent differences associated with disposals and acquisitions have been presented separately and in 2013 included the benefit of lower tax rates applied to the disposal of the Lucozade and Ribena business.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset on tax losses expected to be used on completion of the Novartis transaction is shown in the benefit of previously unrecognised losses.
Other permanent differences include non tax deductible legal settlements.
Re-assessments of prior year estimates include a benefit of 478 million from the resolution of a number of tax matters in various countries.
Future tax charges may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructurings, the location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms, and agreements with tax authorities.

156 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 14 Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
This gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is an ongoing requirement for GSK.
The Group continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
The aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 20 billion 2013 14 billion.
UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.
Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 147 million 2013 129 million has been made in respect of withholding taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries.
The unprovided deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31 December 2014 is estimated to be 600 million 2013 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on repatriation levied by overseas tax jurisdictions.
No further provision is made on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2014 are leased assets with a cost of 733 million 2013 784 million, accumulated depreciation of 226 million 2013 313 million, impairment of 9 million 2013 40 million and a net book value of 498 million 2013 431 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2014 are leased assets with a cost of 68 million 2013 99 million, accumulated depreciation of 17 million 2013 47 million, impairment of 2 million 2013 10 million and a net book value of 49 million 2013 42 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks.
For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%.
The impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 36 million 2013 32 million, R&D 11 million 2013 14 million and SG&A 47 million 2013 78 million, and include nil 2013 62 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The carrying value at 31 December 2014 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was 225 million 2013 6 million.

The majority of this goodwill related to the acquisition of Okairos AG.
This goodwill was allocated to the US, Europe, Emerging Markets and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines cash generating units for impairment testing purposes as the benets of the acquired business are split between these cash generating units.
The transfer to assets held for sale in 2014 arose on the anticipated sale of GSKs Oncology business as part of the proposed three-part transaction with Novartis.
The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is allocated to the following cash generated units: 2014 2013 m m Cash generating unit US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1,734 2,013 Europe Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 458 628 Emerging Markets Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 501 786 Established Products 338 Other 354 446 Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 3,385 3,873 Consumer Healthcare 339 332 3,724 4,205 The amounts allocated to Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, Other Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and ViiV Healthcare are not significant relative to the total balance.
160 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using either a fair value less costs of disposal model or a value in use model.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
Initially a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash ows.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specic country or currency risks.
Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a similar discounted cash ow approach.
A post-tax discount rate is applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows and terminal value.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore, this valuation technique is classied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Details relating to the discounted cash ow models used in the impairment tests of the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Terminal growth rates based on managements estimate of future long-term average growth rates.
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.
Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region.
Period of specific projected cash flows 5 years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
7% Europe Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
7% Emerging Markets Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 3.0% p. a.
10% Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 0.5% p. a.
7% Other Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines 1% p. a.
7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets.
The terminal growth rates used in the fair value less costs of disposal calculations for the cash generating units reect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
The Pharmaceutical and Vaccines cash generating units comprise a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 595 million 2013 599 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 1.48 billion 2013 1.52 billion.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise.
This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency specic risks.
This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible assets.

The joint venture holds the development and commercial rights for existing preventative vaccines from both parent companies.
It will supply vaccines including Human Papillomavirus HPV vaccine, Rotavirus vaccine, Seasonal u vaccine, Mumps vaccine, Diphtheria Pertussis DTP vaccine and Measles Rubella vaccine MRV in Japan.
The Group held one significant associate at 31 December 2014, Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited.
At 31 December 2014, the Group owned 56.5 million shares or 12.4% of Aspen.
Aspen, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, is Africas largest pharmaceutical manufacturer and a major supplier of branded and generic pharmaceutical, healthcare and nutritional products to the southern African and selected international markets.
The investment had a market value of 1,274 million 2013 872 million.
Although the Group holds less than 20% of the ownership interest and voting control of Aspen, the Group has the ability to exercise significant inuence through both its shareholding and its nominated directors active participation on the Aspen Board of Directors.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 892 million 2013 1,000 million, the decrease arising from both disposals and fair value adjustments.
During 2014, one of the companies in which the Group holds an equity investment, Theravance, Inc. Theravance, separated certain of its activities into a new biopharmaceutical company, Theravance Biopharma, Inc. Theravance Biopharma.
Theravances ongoing activities are focused on maximising the potential value of the respiratory assets partnered with the Group, including Relvar Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta.
Theravance is eligible to receive royalty revenues from Relvar Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta and, if approved and commercialised, vilanterol monotherapy.
Theravance Biopharma will carry on all of the other pre-separation activities of Theravance, including development of its pipeline other than development assets partnered with GSK and marketing of its one approved medicine.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held 27% of the common stock of Theravance and 26% of the common stock of Theravance Biopharma.
Both are accounted for as equity investments as the Group does not have the power to exert significant inuence over the activities of either company.
In 2004, the Group and Theravance entered into a governance agreement related to the Groups investment in the company.
Under the terms of this governance agreement, the Group does not have the right to appoint a director to the Theravance board, unless the Groups holding in Theravance exceeds 50%, and must with certain limited exceptions vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the independent directors of the board or in proportion to other shareholders votes cast.
The governance agreement with Theravance expires in September 2015.
On the creation of Theravance Biopharma in 2014, the Group and Theravance Biopharma entered into a governance agreement similar in its terms to the agreement already in place with Theravance, but which expires in 2017.
Under this agreement, the Group does not have the right to appoint a director to the Theravance Biopharma board and must with certain limited exceptions vote its shares either in support of the recommendation of the independent directors of the board or in proportion to other shareholders votes cast.
Net fair value movements include decreases in the value of the investments in Theravance of 280 million and Theravance Biopharma of 62 million.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within Other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

As discussed in Note 43 Proposed Novartis transaction, GSK has announced that it will divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitors to Novartis AG, subject to approvals, as part of a three-part interconditional transaction.
Assets associated with the Oncology business divestment have been classied as held for sale.
Included within Assets held for sale are assets which were written down to fair value less costs to sell of 26 million 2013 nil.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore, this valuation is classied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
At 31 December 2013, Other payables include 620 million in respect of the maximum potential amount payable to non-controlling shareholders in GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd, the Groups pharmaceuticals subsidiary in India.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.
GSK Annual Report 2014 167 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reect recent experience.
These rates are projected using scale BB-2D to allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2034 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 28.0 30.2 27.0 28.7 Projected for 2034 30.1 32.2 28.7 30.4 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the Plans liabilities might increase.
In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the Group has dened an overall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range of assets.
The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term ination, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk.
The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash ows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19R basis, these cash ows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term ination rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve where an increase in long-term ination corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
During 2013, the Group restructured US post-retirement medical obligations for both active and retired members under the age of 65.
The prior plan for participants over 65, paid for medical expenses in excess of those covered by Medicare Part A and Part B as well as for prescription drugs.
Under the new arrangement these participants will instead be eligible to receive an amount, from age 65, from a health reimbursement account, based on years of service, subject to an ination linked maximum of $1,500 per year.
Those already retired and over the age of 65 have also been given the option to switch to this new arrangement.
The impact of this change in 2013 is a credit to the income statement of 279 million and a similar reduction in the post-retirement obligation.
During 2012, the Group changed its policy towards granting discretionary pension increases in the SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes.
In the year, the Group also introduced a limit for all UK dened benefit schemes of 2% per year on the rate at which pensionable pay may increase.
The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the dened benefit liabilities: UK USA Rest of World 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 2.00 2.00 2.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 2.60 2.80 3.00 Discount rate 3.60 4.50 4.40 3.80 4.60 3.80 2.00 3.40 3.30 Expected pension increases 3.00 3.40 3.00 n a n a n a 2.00 2.10 1.90 Cash balance credit conversion rate n a n a n a 3.00 4.20 3.35 0.50 0.90 1.30 Ination rate 3.00 3.40 3.00 2.25 2.25 2.25 1.40 1.80 1.70 168 GSK Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three years ended 31 December 2014 in relation to the dened benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were as follows: Post-retirement benets Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2014 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 119 66 90 275 24 Past service cost credit 7 1 11 3 8 Net interest credit cost 7 14 14 21 54 Gains from settlements 4 4 Expenses 6 4 2 12 125 85 91 301 70 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 629 223 244 1,096 85 Post-retirement benets Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2013 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 117 74 89 280 37 Past service cost credit 4 31 27 273 Net interest cost 12 17 17 46 61 Expenses 6 4 4 14 139 95 79 313 175 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 349 257 74 680 167 Post-retirement benets Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2012 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 130 66 75 271 36 Past service credit cost 391 391 2 Net interest cost 31 26 10 67 66 230 92 85 53 104 Remeasurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 384 48 230 566 119 The past service credit of 273 million in 2013 includes an amount of 279 million in relation to the restructuring of the US post-retirement medical obligations.

In 2013, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identied at the 31 December 2011 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreements following the 2011 valuation, the additional contributions are expected to be 85 million in 2015.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2015, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 320 million in respect of dened benefit pension schemes and 70 million in respect of post-retirement benets.

The Groups foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a net liability fair value of 331 million 68 million asset less 399 million liability.
At December 2013, the fair value was 46 million net liability 74 million asset less 120 million liability.
Following announcement of the proposed Novartis transaction, GSK entered into a number of forward exchange contracts to protect the Sterling value of the net US Dollar proceeds due to the Group on completion of the transaction.
At 31 December 2014 these contracts were in a loss position and resulted in a liability of 264 million and the recognition of an unrealised loss in the year of 299 million.
The rest of the increase in the liability has been due to additional hedging of inter-company loans and deposits, external debt and legal provisions that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing, external debt and legal provisions.
Fair value hedges The Group had designated a series of interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge.
The risk being hedged was the variability of the fair value of the bond arising from interest rate uctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance expense.
Both the bond and the swaps matured in April 2014.
In 2013, the carrying value of bonds in that designated fair value hedging relationship was 919 million.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro and Japanese Yen foreign operations as shown in the table above.
The carrying value of bonds in a designated hedging relationship on page 193 includes 4,124 million 2013 2,369 million that is designated a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
Cash ow hedges During 2014, the Group continued entering into forward foreign exchange contracts which it designated as cash ow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Groups European and US medium term notes.
This is a continuation of the initial hedging put in place in 2013.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging uctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued during the year as disclosed in Note 32.
Hedging transactions of this nature have been carried out during 2014 and 2013.
The balance is reclassied to finance costs over the life of these bonds.

g Sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations as at 31 December.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis only the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies and has concluded that a 10 cent or 10 yen movement in rates against Sterling is reasonable.
In this analysis, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Obligations under finance leases, inter-company loans that are fully hedged to maturity and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt are excluded as they do not present a material exposure.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets and liabilities other than financial instruments is not included in the calculation.
For US dollar denominated financial instruments, the movement in the income statement in the table below relates primarily to hedges of foreign exchange risk on acquisitions and disposals.
Cash and cash equivalents, inter-company loans and deposits, inter-company trading balances, hedging instruments for legal provisions and trade receivables and payables which are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that holds them are impacted when the spot rate changes.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related remeasurement of legal provisions is not included in the calculation.

For 2013 it was a decrease in income of 35 million, 6 million and 1 million.

The table below presents the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates based on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 32 adjusting for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net debt but affect future foreign currency cash ows.

Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis only the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its oating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being issued debt, bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 1% 100 basis points increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt and bank borrowings with a maturity of less than one year is oating rate for this calculation.
In 2013, interest rate movements on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges were deemed to have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement due to compensating amounts in the carrying value of debt.
These hedges and the hedged bond matured in 2014.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.

The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 9 million, 1 million and 1 million for Sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2013 5 million, nil and 2 million.
The decrease in interest income is due to lower levels of cash at the balance sheet date and less Euro net investment hedging activity with foreign exchange forward contracts.
h Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash ows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 40, Commitments.

The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows for the Groups derivative instruments, excluding embedded derivatives and equity options which are not material, using undiscounted cash ows.
The gross cash ows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table, though, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have increased compared to 31 December 2013 due to higher levels of hedging of inter-company loans, hedging of acquisitions and disposals denominated in foreign currency and external debt.
This is reected in the increased principal amounts shown in the table below.

In addition, GSK operates the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets and the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Grants under share option schemes and awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc but in some circumstances will be settled in cash.
Options under the share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2012, 2013 and 2014 are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 0.7% 0.1% 0.5% Dividend yield 5.8% 5.3% 5.2% Volatility 19% 20% 18% 23% Expected lives of savings-related share options and share award schemes 3-4 years 3-4 years 3-4 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Shares 14.14 15.59 14.49 0% for those plans where dividends are reinvested.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted in 2012 and 2013 to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on four equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
The first measure is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash ow targets.
The second measure is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group.
The remaining two measures are based on businessspecic performance measures on business diversication and R&D new product performance.
For details on the calculation of these measures, see the Remuneration report on pages 96 to 128.
For awards granted in 2014 onwards, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
These are adjusted free cashow, TSR and R&D new product performance.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees the performance conditions are based on GSKs EPS growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period and adjusted free cashow.
In addition, some businesses have an element of their award based on a strategic or operational business measure, over a three year measurement period, specic to the employees business area.
The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant.
For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant.

The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions.
In 2014, Treasury shares with a fair value of 150 million were transferred into the UK ESOP Trust to satisfy future awards under the shareholder approved Performance Share Plan.
Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and held at the value of proceeds receivable from employees on exercise.
If there is deemed to be a permanent diminution in value this is reflected by a transfer to retained earnings.
The Trusts also acquire and hold shares to meet notional dividends re-invested on deferred awards under the SmithKline Beecham Mid-Term Incentive Plan.

As part of this proposed transaction, GSK and Novartis will create a new Consumer Healthcare business over which GSK will have majority control, with an equity interest of 63.5%.
In addition, GSK will acquire Novartis global Vaccines business excluding influenza vaccines for an initial cash consideration of $5.25 billion with subsequent potential milestone payments of up to $1.8 billion and ongoing royalties.
GSK will also divest its marketed Oncology portfolio, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitors and also grant commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for an aggregate cash consideration of $16 billion.
Under the terms of the transaction, up to $1.5 billion of the purchase price may have to be returned to Novartis if certain conditions relating to the COMBI-d trial are not met.
Following the positive outcome from this study announced on 6 February 2015, GSK believes these conditions will be satisfied.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the week commencing 2 March 2015.
