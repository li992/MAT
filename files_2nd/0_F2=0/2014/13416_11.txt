BELIEVING ZERO LOSS IS ATTAINABLE All production processes have losses.
Rexams philosophy is that all losses can be understood and minimised by using continuous improvement techniques embedded within an engaged workforce.
In 2013, we started a programme called Zero Loss in several Rexam production facilities to eliminate defects and machine stoppages by using world class total productive maintenance TPM techniques that rely on employee and leadership collaboration for success.
By eliminating losses we are making our production processes inherently safer by removing the need for physical interventions.
We may never get to zero but we have an undying belief that we can always improve, and that, by educating and engaging our workforce, they will fully integrate improvements with their daily work.
Our intention is to accelerate the Zero Loss programme by leveraging any lessons learned and best practices established in 2015 and beyond.
