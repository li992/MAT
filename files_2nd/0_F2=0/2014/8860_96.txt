Statement of Directors Shareholding Executive directors are expected to build up a shareholding in the company over five years.
The proposed minimum shareholding requirement, as set out on page 109, is 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of base salary for the other executive directors.
These shareholding requirements are effective as of the date of approval of the Remuneration Policy.
The previous shareholding requirement was 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors.

2 The directors total shareholding for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement includes shares held beneficially by the director and any connected persons as recognised by the MDRC together with deferred shares awarded under the annual bonus rules for which there are no further performance conditions and any vested but unreleased shares under the LTIP for which there are no further performance conditions.
3 Robert MacLeod will take up the role of Chief Executive on 5th June 2014 and based on his new salary for this role, his shareholding as at 31st March 2014 would be 124%.
