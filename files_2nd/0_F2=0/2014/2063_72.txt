A brief description of each provision together with estimates of the timing of expenditure is given below: DECOMMISSIONING COSTS The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the producing lives of fields is reviewed at least annually and engineering estimates and reports are updated periodically.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date, to the extent that current circumstances indicate BG Group will ultimately bear this cost.
The payment dates of expected decommissioning costs are uncertain and are based on economic assumptions surrounding the useful economic lives of the fields concerned.
Useful economic lives of fields are affected by the estimation of hydrocarbon reserves and resources, which is in turn impacted by available reservoir data, commodity prices and future costs.
Payments on a discounted basis of $705m 2013: $828m are currently anticipated within one to five years: $1 093m 2013: $829m within six to 10 years: and $2 807m 2013: $2 005m over 10 years.
OTHER The balance as at 31 December 2014 includes provisions for onerous contracts of $111m 2013: $146m, field-related payments of $124m 2013: $51m, insurance costs of $107m 2013: $67m and costs associated with disposals and restructuring of $119m 2013: $112m.
The payment dates are uncertain, but are expected to be between 2015 and 2018 2013: 2014 and 2018.
