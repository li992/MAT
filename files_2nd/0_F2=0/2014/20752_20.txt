Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation Allied Minds plc Allied Minds or the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Annual Report and Accounts of Allied Minds and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group are presented for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards, and Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Use of Judgements and Estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Significant estimates made by the Group include those used in calculating share-based payment expense and related valuations, in particular when using Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models to determine the value of the equity based awards, the judgements involved in determining the point of capitalisation of development costs, the judgements used in considering any impairment required in relation to intangible assets, and the judgements made in determining control over subsidiaries.
Significant estimates are also made when determining the appropriate valuation methodology and deriving the fair estimated fair value of subsidiary undertakings.
These judgements include making certain estimates of the future earnings potential of the subsidiary businesses, appropriate discount rate and earnings multiple to be applied, marketability and other industry and company specific risk factors.
Information about these critical judgements and estimates is included in the following notes.
Changes in Accounting Policies In these financial statements the Group has changed its accounting policies in the following areas: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: As a result of IFRS 10 2011, the Group has changed its accounting policy for determining whether it has control over and consequently whether it consolidates its investees.
IFRS 10 introduces a new control model that focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 10, the Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees at 1 January 2014.
No modifications of previous conclusions about control regarding the Groups investees were required.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities: As a result of IFRS 12, the Group has expanded disclosures about its interests in subsidiaries and equity-accounted investees.
indb 101 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Going Concern The Directors have prepared trading and cash flow forecasts for the Group covering the period to 31 December 2016.
Despite the fact that the Group is currently loss making and is likely to continue to be so, at least in the short term, after making enquiries and considering the impact of risks and opportunities on expected cashflows, and given the fact that the Group has in excess of $250 million of available funds in the form of cash and fixed income securities as at 31 December 2014, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate cash to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of Consolidation Allied Minds plc was formed on 15 April 2014 and on 19 June 2014 acquired Allied Minds Inc. now Allied Minds, LLC by share exchange.
Each issued and outstanding common stock of Allied Minds Inc. held by stockholders of Allied Minds, Inc. now Allied Minds, LLC was converted into the right to receive twenty two ordinary shares of Allied Minds plc.
This has been accounted for as a common control transaction under IFRS 3.
B1 see note 16, therefore the consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 comprises the financial statements of Allied Minds plc and the consolidated financial statements of Allied Minds, Inc. now Allied Minds, LLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Changes in the groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related NCI and other components of equity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
indb 102 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Changes in the Groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Functional and Presentation Currency This consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of most of the entities in the Group.
Foreign Currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency U. S. dollar at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or noncontrolling interest, as the case may be.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, joint control or significant influence as the case may be is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the Page 103 of 152 c111026.
indb 103 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Translation reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.
When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while still retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the specific identification or weighted-average method.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Financial Instruments Financial Assets The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated.
All other financial assets are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, security and other deposits, other investments.
Such financial assets are recognised at fair value.
Other investments comprise fixed income debt securities, including government agency and corporate bonds, are stated at amortised cost less impairment.
It is the Group policy to hold these investments till maximum maturity of three years.
indb 104 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Financial Liabilities The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated.
All other financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: trade and other payables and loans.
Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Warrants are accounted for as equity instruments and recorded at fair value.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The Group considers its capital to comprise share capital, share premium, merger reserve, other reserve, translation reserve, and accumulated deficit.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Assets under construction represent machinery and equipment to be used in operations, R&D activities, or to be leased to customers once completed.
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items major components of property and equipment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets: Computers and electronics 3 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Machinery and equipment 5 -20 years Under construction Not depreciated until transferred into use Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Intangible Assets Licences and Purchased In Process Research & Development Licences represent licences provided by universities and scientists in exchange for an equity ownership in the entities.
Purchased in process research & development IPR&D represents time and expertise already invested by the scientist and provided in exchange for an equity interest in the entity.
Licences and purchased IPR&D are valued based on the amount of cash contributed by Allied Minds, at inception of the subsidiary, and the proportionate amount of equity ascribed to Allied Minds.
The licences and IPR&D are capitalised only when they meet the criteria for capitalisation, namely separately identifiable and measurable and it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the entity.
indb 105 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Capitalised Development Costs Research and development costs include charges from universities based on sponsored research agreements SRAs that the subsidiaries of Allied Minds enter into with universities.
Under these agreements, the universities perform research on the technology that is being licenced to the subsidiaries.
Research and development costs also include charges from independent research and development contractors, contract research organisations CROs, and other research institutions.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset, and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
The point at which technical feasibility is determined to have been reached is when regulatory approval has been received, where applicable.
Management determines that commercial viability has been reached when a clear market and pricing point have been identified, which may coincide with achieving recurring sales.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
The expenditure considered for capitalisation includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overhead costs.
Otherwise, the development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Software Software intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, from the date that they are available for use.
Intangible assets which are not yet available for use and therefore not amortised are tested for impairment at least annually.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if appropriate.
The estimated useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are as follows: Licences Over the remaining life of the underlying patents Purchased IPR&D Over the remaining life of the underlying patents, once commercial viability has been achieved Development cost Over the remaining life of the underlying technology Software 2 years Page 106 of 152 c111026.
indb 106 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current Income Tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred Income Tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities where the Group intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Impairment Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Non-financial assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets, including licences, purchased IPR&D, capitalised development cost, with finite lives and such intangible assets which are not yet available for use.
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Intangible assets which are not yet available for use are tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units CGUs.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
indb 107 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued An impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of assets in a CGU on a pro rata basis.
Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes: default or delinquency by a debtor: restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise: indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy: adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers: the disappearance of an active market for a security: or observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of financial assets.
Financial Assets Measured at Amortised Cost The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a collective level.
All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment.
Those found not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet individually identified.
Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment.
Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account.
When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off.
If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Share-based Payments Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using Page 108 of 152 c111026.
indb 108 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Employee Benefits Short-term Employee Benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Defined Contribution Plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Phantom Plan The Phantom Plan is a cash settled bonus plan.
Expense is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that a payment will be made and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Revenue Recognition Sale of Goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership usually occurs when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss.
Rendering of Services The Group recognises revenue from rendering of services at the time services are provided to the customer and the Group has no additional performance obligation to the customer.
indb 109 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Government Grants Grants received are recognised as revenue when the related work is performed and the qualifying research and development costs are incurred.
Finance Income and Finance Costs Finance income mainly comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains.
Finance costs mainly comprise loan interest expense and foreign exchange losses.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised as they accrue in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Fair Value Measurements A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Groups Consolidated Statements of Financial Position approximates their fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments.
Operating Leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Operating Segments Allied Minds determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the executive management team, the body which is considered to be Allied Minds Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
An operating segment is a component of Allied Minds that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Allied Minds other components.
The operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
indb 110 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted A number of new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2015, and have not therefore been applied in preparing this consolidated financial information.
Management has yet to complete an analysis of these new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards on the results of its operations, financial position, and disclosures.
The Group intends to adopt these standards on their respective effective dates.
The following are amended or new standards and interpretations that may impact the Group.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: IFRS 9, Financial instruments effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2017 Amendment to IFRS 11, Joint arrangements on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38, Intangible assets, on depreciation and amortisation effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IFRS 9, Financial instruments, on general hedge accounting effective date 1 Jan 2018 Amendments to IAS 27, Separate financial statements on equity accounting effective 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28, Investments in associates and joint ventures on sale or contribution of assets effective 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28, Investments in associates and joint ventures on applying the consolidation exemption effective 1 January 2016 Annual improvements 2014 effective 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements disclosure initiative effective 1 January 2016 3 Revenue Revenue recorded in the statement of comprehensive loss consists of the following: 2014 2013 For the year ended 31 December: $000 $000 Product revenue 7,396 2,396 Service revenue 230 387 Grant revenue 89 153 Total revenue in consolidated statement of loss 7,715 2,936 Page 111 of 152 c111026.

Due to their size and nature Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc. or STT, an early stage company and RF Biocidics, Inc. or RFB, a commercial stage company are not aggregated and presented as two additional separate reportable segments.
The Groups principal operations are therefore presented as four reportable segments being early stage company STT, early stage companies other, commercial stage company RFB, and commercial stage companies other.
The Groups CODM reviews internal management reports on these segments at least quarterly in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Other operations include the management function of the head office at the parent level of Allied Minds.

6 Share-Based Payments U. S. Stock Option Stock Issuance Plan The U. S. Stock Option Stock Issuance Plan the U. S. Stock Plan was originally adopted by Allied Minds, Inc in 2008.
The U. S. Stock Plan provides for the grant of share option awards, restricted share awards, and other awards to acquire common stock of Allied Minds, Inc now Allied Minds, LLC.
All stock options granted to employees under this plan are equity settled, for a ten-year term Pursuant to the reorganisation discussed above, Allied Minds plc adopted and assumed the rights and obligations of Allied Minds, Inc. under this plan except that the obligation to issue Common Stock is replaced with an obligation to issue ordinary shares to satisfy awards granted under the U. S. Stock Plan.
Measurement of Fair Values The fair value of the stock option grants awarded in 2014 and 2013 under the Allied Minds 2008 Plan was estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model that uses the following weighted average assumptions, respectively: 2014 2013 Expected option life in years 5.51 5.
89% Expected dividend yield Grant date option fair value $ 0.93 $ 1.
21 Share price at grant date $ 2.49 $ 2.
60 Grant date option fair value, share price at grant date, and exercise price disclosed above take into account the reorganisation described above in note 1.
Expected volatility has been based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of the share price of publicly traded companies comparable to Allied Minds, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term.
The expected term of the instruments has been based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour.

5 million The options outstanding as of 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 had an exercise price in the range of $0.
As of 19 June 2014, the maximum number of options reserved under the plan were issued and outstanding and as a result of the reorganisation discussed in note 16, all issued and outstanding options vested on 19 June 2014 and some options were exercised, resulting in the accelerated sharebased payment charge of additional $2.
The Company does not intend to make any further grants under the U. S. Stock Plan.
Restricted share awards are outstanding over 118,800 ordinary shares, which were granted under the U. S. Stock Plan to the non-executive Directors.
These ordinary shares vest in three equal tranches on each of the first three anniversaries of Admission provided that the non-executive Director in question is still providing services to the Group on the relevant vesting date.
UK Long Term Incentive Plan On 19 June 2014, Allied Minds plc established the UK Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under the LTIP, awards over Ordinary Shares may be made to employees, officers and Directors, and other individuals providing services to the Company and its subsidiaries.
Awards may be granted in the form of share options, share appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted share awards, performance share awards, restricted share units, phantom-share awards and other share-based awards.
Awards have been made under the LTIP upon the Companys admission to the LSE in respect of a total of 4,618,842 Ordinary Shares.
It is intended that awards will normally vest only after a minimum period of three years from the date of grant.
Vesting will normally be subject to the achievement of performance conditions and continued services of the participant.
In respect of the initial awards, which have been made conditionally on Admission, vesting is dependent upon performance metrics as follows: 60% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance in respect of the period from Admission until 31 December 2016: and Page 117 of 152 c111026.
indb 117 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 40% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder value metrics SVM, including but not limited to: i the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual property reviewed: ii the increase in quality of the partnership pipeline: and iii subsidiary level performance assessed by reference to such matters as external funding raised, corporate collaborations, product co-development and proof of principal commercial pilots and revenues Performance will be assessed on these measures on a scorecard basis over a three year period.
In respect of the initial awards, at the end of the three year period, performance against the relevant measures will be calculated to determine the number of Ordinary Shares which have satisfied the vesting criteria and 50% of the award will then vest at that time.
The remaining 50% will vest in two equal tranches in years 4 and 5 subject to the relevant participant still being employed within or being a director of a company within the Group at the relevant vesting date or being an earlier good leaver as described further in the LTIP.

The share grants that vests only upon the occurrence of a performance condition i. e. the SVM grants and service condition were valued at the fair value of the shares on the date of the grants.

This Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value is a sum-of-the-parts SOTP valuation of all the subsidiaries that make up the Group.
The increase in the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value during the year principally reflects the increase in value at Spin Transfer Technologies and SciFluor Life Sciences supported by their valuations at recent fund raising transactions.

The AICPA Guidelines do not represent, but are consistent with valuation principles adopted under, International Financial Reporting Standards.
As of 31 December 2014, the Groups estimated Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value was distributed across the Groups operating segments as follows: 2014 2013 Operating Segment $m % of GSOAV $m % of GSOAV Early stage 389.1 79.7% 273.
0% Ownership adjusted value represents Allied Minds interest in the equity value of each subsidiary: Business Enterprise Value Long Term Debt Cash x Allied Minds percentage ownership plus the value of debt provided by Allied Minds plc to each subsidiary business.
Allied Minds commits postseed funding to its subsidiaries in the form of loans.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value includes cash balances held by Allied Minds subsidiaries at 31 December 2014 amounting to $86.

7m held at the parent level and available for investment in the Group.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value has been calculated on the basis of Allied Minds percentage ownership as at 31 December 2014.
Where subsidiaries have raised financing from external parties since 31 December 2014, the ownership adjusted value in the table above has been updated to reflect the current percentage ownership and the valuation implied by that external investment on a post new money basis.

Valuation Methodology Each subsidiary company is regularly evaluated based on a range of inputs, including: company performance and progress towards development milestones: market and competitor analyses based on information from databases and public material: and interviews with scientists and physicians.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value represents the sum-of-the-parts SOTP of, principally, net present value NPV or risk-adjusted net present value rNPV from discounted cash flow DCF valuations: valuations based on recent third party investment at the subsidiary level.
DCF valuation is used for the majority of Allied Minds subsidiaries.
If a transaction occurred close to valuation date, then that will generally form the basis for the valuation.
In limited instances other techniques such as based on asset values are utilised.
indb 129 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Set out below are the two principal methodologies applied to value each Group company to derive the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value as at 31 December 2014: Third party funding Discounted cash flow transaction Biotectix, LLC Precision Biopsy, LLC Allied Bristol Life Sciences, LLC BridgeSat, Inc ProGDerm, Inc. dba Novare Optio Labs, Inc. Cephalogics, LLC RF Biocidics, Inc. SciFluor Life Sciences, LLC CryoXtract Instruments, LLC Seamless Devices, Inc.

0% As at 31 December 2013, only Optio Labs, Inc. was valued based on a third party funding transaction.
In addition to the two principal valuation methodologies, the Directors have valued using alternative valuation methodologies Allied Minds Federal Innovations, Inc. AMFI, representing 3.
2% of the group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value 2013: 4.
AMFI was valued using an asset-based methodology that reflects the intellectual property to which it has access as at 31 December 2014 and 2013.
Net Present Valuation NPV method NPV is a standard technique used in valuation and can be defined as the difference between the present value of the future cash flows from an investment and the amount of investment.
Present value of the estimated cash flows is computed by discounting them at the required rate of return which includes an adjustment for risk.
The following are important factors when determining fair value based on NPV: Estimated income generally consists of sales, co-development revenues, one-time payments and royalty payments on sales depending on the company, its business model and industry.
These are estimated based on a variety of factors including, inter alia: total addressable market: competitive factors: barriers to competition: pricing: typical standards for contract value: royalty rates: and likelihood of development of a product that is commercially viable.
Costs and capital expenditures are estimated for each phase of development based on the companies information or according to industry standards.
Costs are typically forecasted for cost of goods, SG&A selling, general and administrative, research and development as well as a variety of other expenses.
These are typically developed from the ground up for earlier years and for later years depicted as a factor or percentage of sales.
The terminal or exit value represents the aggregate value of an entity at the end of the discrete forecast period.
Terminal value may be estimated using the terminal multiple method, which inherently assumes that the business will be valued at the end of the projection period based on Page 130 of 152 c111026.
indb 130 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued reference valuations.
Under this methodology, the terminal value is typically calculated by applying one of two commonly accepted methodologies: Multiple base terminal value: Use of an appropriate multiple to the relevant financial metric forecasted for the last projected year taking into consideration the ongoing growth potential of the business in the terminal year.
Exit values included in the analysis are typically projected as a multiple of EBIT, EBITDA or Sales based on the final year results for the forecast period.
Where available, a set of guideline public companies that are similar to the company to be used for comparative purposes and the multiple is derived from this set: Gordon growth model based terminal value: Use of a formula that calculates the present value of cash flow in the terminal year growing into infinity at an ascribed terminal growth rate.
The terminal growth rate is derived by estimating the long-term annual growth potential of the business at the terminal year.
rNPV is a technique typically used when valuing pharmaceutical or biological companies and has been used in estimating the value of ProGDerm.
When using rNPV, it is the same process as developing an NPV analysis though costs and revenues are probability adjusted downward based on the phase of development.
Selection of discount rates is based on part utilising American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA practice standards varying by stage of development of the subsidiary as well as other risk factors and typically range from 20-45% When utilising rNPV, discount rates are typically lower reflecting the probability adjustment of the cash flows already made.
Significant events occurring after the date of valuation according to the previous paragraph have been taken into account in the valuation to the extent that such events would have affected the value on the closing date.
Where available NPV results are compared against peer companies and to valuations for similar companies.
Due to the early stage nature of the Groups subsidiary companies, projections are particularly sensitive to certain key assumptions namely: Discount rate and in particular risk premium: The ability to predict the cost and timing of achieving technical and commercial viability: Projected revenue and operating costs in the post-product development phase of each company: and The size and share of addressable market for intellectual property, products and services developed.
Whilst the Board considers the methodologies and assumptions adopted in valuation are supportable, reasonable and robust, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed and the differences could be significant.

If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
The Group has determined that the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and payables, security and other deposits, and customer deposits are a reasonable approximation of their fair values and are included in Level 2.
The secured bank loan was at a floating interest rate of 1.
25% above Prime rate, which was adjustable immediately when Prime rate changes.
As such, the Group has determined that the fair value of the secured bank loan equals the carrying amount at 31 December 2013 and is classified as Level 2.
22 Capital and Financial Risk Management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Management monitors the level of capital deployed and available for deployment in subsidiary projects.
The board of directors seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of deployed capital and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups executive management and board of directors have overall responsibility for establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Group is exposed to certain risks through its normal course of operations.
The Groups main objective in using financial instruments is to promote the commercialisation of intellectual property through the raising and investing of funds for this purpose.
The Groups policies in calculating the nature, amount and timing of funding are determined by planned future investment activity.

Risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on ratings in accordance with limits set by the board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to credit ratings if available or to historical information about counterparty default rates.
Group policy is to maintain its funds in highly liquid deposit accounts with reputable financial institutions.

indb 144 25 04 2015 02:07 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate The Group is primarily subject to taxation in the US, therefore the reconciliation of the effective tax rate has been prepared using the US statutory tax rate.
A reconciliation of the US statutory rate to the effective tax rate is as follows: 2014 2013 % % Weighted average statutory rate 35.0 35.
0 Effect of state tax rate in US 5.4 5.
9 Current year losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 61.6 32.
1 Factors that may affect future tax expense The Group is primarily subject to taxation in the US and UK.
Additionally, the Group is exposed to state taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the US.
Changes in corporate tax rates can change both the current tax expense benefit as well as the deferred tax expense benefit.
The main UK corporate tax rates enacted for the taxation financial years 1 April to 31 March the following calendar year 2014 and 2013 are 21% and 23%, respectively.
The maximum corporate tax rate in the US for the corresponding periods is 35% Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom: 2014 2013 As of 31 December: $000 $000 1 Operating tax losses 59,586 32,170 2 Capital losses 1,952 2,017 1 Research credits 3,820 2,616 3 Temporary differences 17,829 11,616 Deferred tax assets 83,187 48,419 3 Other temporary differences 974 824 Deferred tax liabilities 974 824 Deferred tax assets, net, not recongised 82,213 47,595 1 expire starting in 2024 2 expire starting in 2015 3 generally will expire 20 years subsequent to the time the deduction is taken Page 145 of 152 c111026.
indb 145 25 04 2015 02:07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position date.
The reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 20% from 23% was substantially enacted on 2 July 2013 and will apply from 1 April 2015.
However, the UK corporation tax rate initially reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014.
The change in the UK corporate tax rate did not materially impact the calculation of the deferred tax assets as these assets are generally exposed to tax in US jurisdiction.
There were no movements in deferred tax recognised in income or equity in 2014 or 2013 as the deferred tax asset was not recognised in any of those years.
