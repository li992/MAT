Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 2 July 2014.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 prior year 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, GreeneKing Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue tobe consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, apart from the changes arising from the adoption of new accounting standards set out below: The Group applied, for the first time, certain standards and amendments that require restatement of previous financial statements.
Theseinclude amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised 2011.
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income amendments to IAS 1 The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income.
Items that could be reclassified orrecycled to profit or loss at a future point in time, for example net gains on cash flow hedges taken to equity, are now presented separately from items that will never be reclassified, for example actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
Theamendment has affected the presentation of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income but has had no impact onthegroupsfinancial position or performance.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 2011 IAS 19 revised 2011 has been applied retrospectively from 30 April 2012 with comparatives restated for the impact of its adoption.
Thestandard replaces interest costs and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net pension liability asset.
The impact of IAS 19 revised 2011 on the current and comparative period is shown in note 9.
IAS 19 revised has been applied retrospectively, with the following permitted exceptions: the carrying amounts of other assets have not been adjusted for changes in employee benefit costs that were included before 28 April 2012: and sensitivity disclosures for the defined benefit obligation for the comparative period have not been provided.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 applies prospectively for financial periods that began on or after 1 January 2013 and establishes a single source of guidance under IFRSfor all fair value measurement.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair values, but rather provides guidance on howtomeasure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted and extends the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurement.
The standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price.
The default risk, i. e. the entitys own credit risk, must also be reflected in the fair value of a liability.
The implementation of IFRS 13 has resulted in a non-significant adjustment to the fair value of derivatives.
Significant accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term ofthe lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, ifappropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on fide-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, andis included in the income statement in the year of fide-recognition.
co. uk Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC 71 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of theconsideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
Thechoice of measurement of non-controlling interests, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable netassets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation inaccordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes tothe fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be re-measured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal orseparability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised ifthe acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held inthe business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group.
An assets or cash-generating units recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of thegroups cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective ofwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated withthe operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
72 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.
co. uk Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are fide-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work inprogress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management is committed to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
co. uk Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC 73 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full inthe group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss isrecognised in the income statement in the same period.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recorded in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations less the fair value of scheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged totheincome statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded.
Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which isrecognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments arerecognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
74 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.
co. uk Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or ofan asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that itis probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied As at the date of approval of the financial statements there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 and has since been amended several times.
The standard will eventually replace IAS 39 and covers the classification, measurement and fide-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model.
The IASB intends to expand IFRS 9 to add new requirements for impairment and for it to become a complete replacement of IAS 39 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on classification and measurement of the groups financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification and measurement of financial liabilities.
The group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard including all phases is issued.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements.
It also addresses the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, which resulted in SIC-12 being withdrawn.
IFRS 10 changes whether an entity is consolidated by revising the definition of control and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
There is no impact on the groups financial position of performance as a result of the introduction of this standard.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 that were previously included in IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other legal entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off-balance sheet vehicles.
The impact on the group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial statements only, where summarised information may need to be provided.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and establishes a comprehensive framework for determining when to recognise revenue and how much revenue to recognise.
The core principle in that framework is that a company should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard was published in May 2014 and the impact of its introduction has yet to be assessed by the group.

The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation.
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and or cash flow in future periods.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefiteach period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest: judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
76 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.
co. uk Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value in use at a site level.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Property provisions The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts.
However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level of provision recorded.
2 Segment information The group has determined the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers: Retail: Managed pubs and restaurants Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased pubs Brewing & Brands: Brewing, marketing and selling beer These are also considered to be the groups operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms length basis.

An impairment charge totalling 34.2m has been recognised as a result of this disposal: 19.6m in respect of the carrying value of the assets and a charge of 14.6m relating to the impairment of goodwill allocated to these sites.
During the period the group has recognised an impairment loss of 22.0m 2013: 17.7m in respect of its licensed estate.
The impairment has been recognised in respect of pubs where the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell has fallen below the net book value.
During the period ended 2 May 2010 the group received a refund of 7.0m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines following aruling involving the Rank Group plc that the application of VAT contravened the EUs principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC appealed theruling, issuing protective assessments to recover the VAT in the event its appeal was successful.
On 30 October 2013 the decision was overturned and the group was therefore required to repay the VAT of 7.0m and associated interest of 1.7m in the period.
On 16 April 2014 theSupreme Court granted Rank permission to appeal which is likely to be heard in early 2015.
In the period, the group received insurance compensation to meet the costs of restoring fire-damaged sites totalling 3.4m 2013: 0.8m.
Further amounts are receivable as the projects progress.
Acquisition costs in the prior year were in respect of amounts payable, two years post acquisition and subject to the future profitability ofthe businesses, to the former owners of Cloverleaf Restaurants and Realpubs, who remained employees of the group.
Following the closure of the groups defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual an exceptional credit of 8.4m was recognised in the prior year.
This comprised a gain of 10.1m in respect of past service accruals no longer being linked to future salary growth less 1.7m ofimplementation costs and fees.
The net loss on disposal of property plant and equipment of 6.4m 2013: 5.4m loss comprises a total profit on disposal of 8.0m 2013: 6.9m and a total loss on disposal of 14.4m 2013: 12.3m.
The loss on disposal includes 6.4m 2013: 4.5m in respect of goodwill allocated toparts of operating segments disposed of in the year.
The other loss on disposal of 1.3m relates to the loss on disposal of an investment inthe prior year.
Exceptional finance costs The 1.1m fair value gain is the mark-to-market movement on the ineffective element of cash flow hedges resulting from changes intheLIBOR yield curve.
Exceptional tax The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate arisen from movements in their tax base cost, including the impact of indexation.
The Finance Act 2013 reduced the rate of corporate tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The lower rate of20% has been used to determine the overall net deferred liability as the temporary differences are expected to reverse at the lower rate.
The effect of the lower rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 9.1m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of18.8m and a debit to the group statement of comprehensive income of 9.7m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods income tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods including tax relief for capital expenditure and repairs and reversal of tax relief previously taken on intra-group transactions.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods deferred tax arises from finalising the tax returns and also deferred tax on revaluation androlled over gains on the licensed estate.

In prior periods a deferred bonus scheme and an executive share option plan ESOS have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors remuneration report on pages 49 to 60.
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions is6.0m 2013: 5.0m.
A corresponding credit of 4.4m 2013: 3.9m has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of the LTIP growth LTIP issued in 2014 is considered to be equal to the share price on the date of issue.
The fair value of equity-settled options issued in prior years was estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of the grants andmodel inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period was as follows: 2014 SAYE Weighted average share price 865p Exercise price 701p Expected dividend yield 3.3% Risk-free rate of return 0.6% Volatility 21.6% Expected life years 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 163p 2013 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 596p 708p Exercise price 505p Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3.8% Risk-free rate of return 0.2% 0.6% Volatility 23.8% 22.0% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 521p 168p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative offuture exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.

ESOS, SAYE and LTIP Options were exercised on a range of dates.
The weighted average share price through the period was 841p in 2014 and 607p in 2013.
The rights outstanding at 4 May 2014 under the LTIP had an exercise price of nil 2013: nil and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.3 years 2013: 1.3 years.
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 408p and 528p 2013: 332p and 528p and for the SAYE scheme between 274p and 701p 2013: 274p and 505p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.1 years for the ESOS 2013: 1.8 years and 2.8 years for the SAYE scheme 2013: 2.8 years.

Pension benefits are related to members final salary at the earlier of retirement or closure to future accrual and theirlength of service.
Since the pension liability is adjusted for the changes to consumer price index, the pension plan is exposed to inflation, interest rate risks and changes in the life expectancy for pensioners.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equity shares of entities in manufacturing and consumer product sector, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk arising in the manufacturing and consumer products sector.
IAS 19 revised 2011 restatement IAS 19 revised 2011 has been applied retrospectively from 30 April 2012.
As a result, expected returns on pension schemes assets are nolonger recognised in profit or loss.
Instead, net interest on the net defined benefit obligation calculated using the discount rate used tomeasure the pension liability is recognised in profit or loss.

As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year.
The amount disposed is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 353.5m 2013: 353.8m to Retail, 135.8m 2013: 156.5m to Pub Partners and 214.5m 2013: 214.5m to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one year budgets approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used toextrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to each cash-generating units pub estate or operations, sales prices and volumes, capital expenditure, business mix and margin.
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% 2013: 9.0% which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant operating segment.
A growth rate of 2.0% 2013: 2.0% has been used to extrapolate cash flows.
The growth rate is considered a conservative rate and is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Management considers that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in growth rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow.
As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation none of these changes would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.

Arepresentative sample of properties was also valued by external valuer Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, whoconfirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition toIFRS: therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, atfair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,422.1m 2013: 1,437.7m over which there is a first charge infavour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

The impairment includes a 19.6m charge in relation to the sale of the disposal group as discussed in note 5.
1.6m of the impairment recognised in the prior year within the Retail estate was in respect of licensed properties damaged by fire.
Intheperiod the group has received 3.4m 2013: 0.8m of insurance compensation to meet the costs incurred to date of restoring these properties: further compensation is expected to be received as the restoration projects progress.

Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators ofimpairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
Therecoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9% 2013: 9% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2013: 2% which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
Estimates of fair value less costs to sell are based on valuations undertaken by in-house property experts.
The impairment in respect of the disposal group has been calculated based on expected net disposal proceeds.
The remaining impairment charge recognised in the Retail and Pub Partners estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site-specific trading circumstances and the general weakening ofthe UK consumer environment seen in the year.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased impairment resulting from a 10% reduction in fair value: 2014 2013 m m Retail 0.9 0.6 Pub Partners 2.8 3.8 3.7 4.4 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount rate: 2014 2013 m m Retail 0.6 0.4 Pub Partners 1.9 3.2 2.5 3.6 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% reduction in growth rate: m m Retail 0.6 0.4 Pub Partners 1.9 3.2 2.5 3.6 www.

Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although any individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 460m facility until June 2018.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Liquidity facility During the current period the standby liquidity facility provider had its short-term credit rating downgraded below the minimum prescribed in the relevant facility agreement and as such the group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the facility and hold it in a designated bank account.
The corresponding balance of 157.5m 2013: nil held in this bank account is included within cash and cash equivalents.
The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisations debt service obligations should there ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments.
As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash.
Securitised debt The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.
Includes the effect of interest rate swaps and future rate step-ups.
Carrying value is net of related deferred finance fees.

Paymentof interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions onits ability to move cash to other group companies.
24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 4 May 2014 and 28 April 2013.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits doesnot change as interest rates move.
Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end.
An explanation for the split between those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax byapproximately 0.6m 2013: 0.2m and the groups equity by 81.0m 2013: 106.1m.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
Thegroups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2013: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than one month.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.

Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation andthe maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 4 May 2014 the group held four 2013: four interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 170m 2013: 140m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the 276.6m 2013: 177.8m draw down from the variable credit facility in the year.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 23.4m 2013: 4.0m.
The cash flows occurred semi-annually based a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 4 May 2014 the group held five 2013: five interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 585.1m 2013: 667.9m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps.
A fair value liability of 149.0m 2013: 235.2m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 585.1m 2013: 667.9m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 7.3% 2013: 5.1%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms excluding credit risk.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
Following repurchase of the 60.0m AB1 the cash flow hedge in respect of this bond has ceased to be effective and hedge accounting has been discontinued.
In the prior year an exceptional cost of 28.2m was recognised in respect of the fair value of the interest rate swap no longer qualifying for hedge accounting which has been recycled from equity to the income statement.
The remaining interest rate swaps have been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining contract lives.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 95.5% 2013: 98.6% in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.
96 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.
co. uk Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Interest rate risk The following tables set out the groups exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest-bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values Set out in the table on page 98 is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits approximates to the carrying amount stated inthe accounts.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt: approximates to the carrying amount in the case ofthefloating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date and adjusting for, where appropriate, the groups and counterparty credit risk.
The changes in credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used toderive fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the periods ending 4 May 2014 and 28 April 2013 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels together referred to as capital, as appropriate in the light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
