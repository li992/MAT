Provisions Restructuring Restructuring Environmental Environmental Total m m m m At 1 January 2014 2.6 6.0 7.8 16.4 Increase in provision 3.1 0.6 1.4 5.1 Release of provision 0.1 0.8 0.9 Utilisation of provision 2.2 0.8 0.7 3.7 Exchange difference 0.1 0.3 0.2 0.4 At 31 December 2014 3.3 6.1 7.9 17.3 Included in current liabilities 6.9 Included in non-current liabilities 10.4 17.3 The restructuring provision relates to the remaining costs associated with the closure of a number of Heat Treatment sites and with the establishment of an accounting Shared Service Centre in Prague.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
Whilst the Groups use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities.
In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future.
However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above.
Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.
