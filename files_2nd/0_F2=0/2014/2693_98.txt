Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.5 Intangible assets The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and pro ts.
These assets include goodwill, soft ware, licences and operating agreements and customer contracts.
Within licence and operating agreements we include the cost of any acquired spectrum we use for our mobile services.
The cost of intangible assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been an acquisition of a business, the fair value of the speci c intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
Goodwill arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of the net assets of that business.
Goodwill is not amortised but subject to annual impairment tests.
The value of goodwill is an intangible value that comes from, for example, synergies we expect to gain and the value of its employees.
The value of other intangible assets reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset via an annual amortisation charge.
Should an assets value fall below its carrying value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against pro t. Accounting policy detailed in note 5.1.
