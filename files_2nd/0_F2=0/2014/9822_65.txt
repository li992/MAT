35 Change in accounting policy Adoption of IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 2011 The Group has retrospectively adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 2011 in the current period.
The revised standard requires the Group to recognise a single net interest component in respect of its defined benefit pension plan, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset liability.
In addition to this, the interest on the service cost is now required to be included as part of the service cost itself rather than forming part of the interest cost.
The impact of the retrospective application of this new standard on the Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, Group cash flow statement and earnings per share for the 53 weeks ended 5 October 2013 is set out below.
There was no impact on the Group balance sheet.
