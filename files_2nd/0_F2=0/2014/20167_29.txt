108 Financial statements Significant accounting policies 3i Group plc the Company is a company registered in England and Wales.
The Consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 March 2014 comprise the Financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Separate financial statements of the Company are also presented.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except where separately disclosed.
A number of key accounting policies are disclosed below, but where possible, accounting policies have been shown as part of the Note that they specifically relate to in order to assist in understanding.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 14 May 2014.
A Statement of compliance These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and their interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted foruseinthe European Union IFRS and in accordance and compliance with the Companies Act 2006.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB has issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to financial statements with periods commencing on or after the following dates: Effective for period beginning on or after IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018 IAS 32 Amendment to offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non financial assets amendments to IAS 36 1 January 2014 IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting amendments to IAS 39 1 January 2014 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application and have decided not to adopt early.
The Group has applied IFRS 10 in line with the guidance given at the IFRIC meeting in January 2014 and supported by the IASB in March 2014.
Impact of the application of IFRS 10, 11, 12 and 13, and IAS 19 The Group applied, for the first time, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised2011 that require restatement of previous financial statements.
Further, the application of IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement resulted in additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The nature and the impact of each new standard and amendment are described below.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Under IFRS 10 a large number of entities within the Group have been classified as investment entities.
As a result they are no longer consolidated andare instead held at fair value.
Impact on statement of comprehensive income As a result of this change in treatment the total return generated by the investment entities is no longer presented on a line-by-line basis but combined and shown as a new line in the Statement of comprehensive income Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries.
Thishasresulted in arestatement of prior year figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated into this line.
The impact of this change by line item is: Realised profits over value on the disposal of investments 140 million : Unrealised profits on the revaluation of investments 94 million : Dividends 13 million : Income from loans and receivables 35 million : Fees receivable from external funds 27 million : Operating expenses 23 million : Interest receivable 1 million : Carried interest receivable from external funds 2 million : Carried interest and performance fees payable 2 million : Income taxes 3 million : Exchange movements 102 million : Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries 491 million : and Income expense from fair value subsidiaries 109 million.
There is no overall change to total return.
The above amounts do not agree to the reconciliation on page 54 as differences are also caused by the reclassification of the Credit Opportunities Fund and the impact of IAS 19R.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial statements 109 Translation of investment entity subsidiaries which are non-sterling denominated will no longer be shown as part of other comprehensive income Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations and will now be included as part of the fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries held at fair value.
Consequently these translation amounts will no longer be shown as a movement in the translation reserve and it willbecome a movement in capital reserves.
IFRS 10 has been retrospectively applied as if IFRS 10 was in effect from 1 April 2012.
The translation reserve has been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 10 for the year to 31 March 2012 by 157 million and for the year to 31 March 2013 by338 million with corresponding movements in capital reserves.
Basic and diluted earnings per share of the Group have been restated as a result of adopting IFRS 10.
Impact on statement of financial position The closing fair value of the net assets of the investment entities is now combined and stated in a new line Investments in investment entities.
Thishas resulted in a restatement of prior year figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated into this line.
The impact of this change by line item is: Quoted investments 188 million : Unquoted investments 1,427 million : Carried interest receivable 10 million : Intangible assets 22 million : Other current assets 20 million : Cash and cash equivalents 46 million : Trade and other payables 50 million : Carried interest and performance fees payable 30 million : Current income taxes 2 million : Provisions 1 million : and Investment in investment entities 1,630 million.
Cash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the Investments in investment entities line and not consolidated.
Intercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and consolidated Group entities which would have previously been eliminated on consolidation are no longer eliminated.
There is no change to the net assets presented as a result of the adoption of IFRS 10, albeit that gross assets and gross liabilities have changed as a result of the changes to cash and intercompany balances.
An opening balance sheet has also been provided this year to show the effect on the opening balances of the prior year.
Impact on cash flow statement The cash flow statement is impacted by the adoption of IFRS 10 because the cash held by investment entity subsidiaries is no longer consolidated.
Itnow forms part of the fair value of the investment entity subsidiary.
Additionally, the cash flow statement now includes a new line to disclose the cash movements to and from investment entities, Cash inflow outflow from fair value subsidiaries.
This has resulted in a restatement of prior year figures where previously consolidated line items are now aggregated and disclosed in these lines.
The impact of this change on cash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2013 is a reduction of 46 million and the change by line item is: Purchase of investments 67 million : Proceeds from investments 253 million : Portfolio interest received 10 million : Portfolio dividends received 21 million : Fees received from external funds 28 million : Carried interest and performance fees paid 8 million : Operating expenses 36 million : Income taxes paid 3 million : Acquisition of management contracts and other Debt Management business development 10 million : Investment Divestment into fair value subsidiaries 197 million : and Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year 78 million.
The above amounts do not agree to the reconciliation on page 57 as differences are also caused by the reclassification of the Credit Opportunities Fund and the impact of IAS 19R.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements The application of IFRS 11 had no material effect on the accounts of the Company or Group for the periods presented.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure requirements and include additional disclosures for unconsolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated structured entities.
IFRS 12 disclosures and descriptions in relation to unconsolidated subsidiaries are provided in Notes 14 and 34 and structured entities impacted are provided in Note 32.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement The Group has adopted IFRS 13 which relates to the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities.
In the current year, the methodology for calculating the fair value of its investment portfolio has been amended in respect of the loans, bonds and fixed income shares held in the investment portfolio.
The Group will now value such instruments at fair value through profit and loss, rather than at amortised cost less impairment.
This has noimpact on the carrying value in the balance sheet.
IFRS 13 requires more comprehensive disclosures around the sensitivities of Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The relevant additional disclosures are provided in Note 13.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits A description of the impact on the financial statements is included in Note 8 to the financial statements.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 110 Financial statements Significant accounting policies B Basis of preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest million pounds m except whereotherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affectthe application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised inthefinancial statements: Assessment as investment entity Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled entities, as well asinvestments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit and loss.
Subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment related activities with investees continue to be consolidated unless they are also investment entities.
The criteria which define an investment entity are currently as follows: An entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services: An entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and An entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
The Groups annual and interim accounts clearly state its objective of investing directly into portfolio investments and providing investment management services to investors for the purpose of generating returns in the form of investment income and capital appreciation.
The Group has always reported its investment in portfolio investments at fair value.
It also produces reports for investors of the funds it manages and its internal management report on a fair value basis.
The exit strategy for all investments held by the Group is assessed, initially, at the time of the first investment and this is documented in the investment paper submitted to the Investment Committee for approval.
Subsequently it is then reviewed atleast twice a year during semi annual portfolio review meetings.
The Board has also concluded that the Company meets the additional characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investment: the investments are predominantly in the form of equities and similar securities: it has more than one investor and its investors are not related parties.
The Board has concluded that the Company therefore meets the definition of an investment entity.
These conclusions will be reassessed onan annual basis for changes in any of these criteria or characteristics.
Application and significant judgments A number of entities which the Group previously consolidated will now be recognised at fair value.
The majority of the Groups portfolio is held through intermediate holding entities which are now fair valued at the entity level as opposed to consolidating the intermediate holding entities and fair valuing the underlying portfolio.
In addition, the Group is deemed to control a limited partnership, an entity in which it holds 46% of the equity.
Consequently this is also fair valued at the entity level with the proportion of value attributable to 3is equity stake recognised.
In coming to these conclusions a full consideration of the Groups ownership, other shareholder dispersion, the Groups role as agent or principal and other factors that lead to control have been considered.
The most significant estimates relate to the fair valuation of the investment portfolio, the fair valuation of each investment entity subsidiary and the IAS 19 valuation of the defined benefit scheme.
The valuation methodology for the investment portfolio is disclosed in Note 13 and details of the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme is shown in Note 8.
As a result of IFRS 10, we are required to fair value each investment entity subsidiary and have assessed this to be equal to the net asset value of the investment entity subsidiary at the balance sheet date with the exception ofone entity which we value on a sum of parts basis.
All investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for using accounting policies that are consistent with the Groups, and the primary constituent of net asset value across investment entity subsidiaries is portfolio investment.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period inwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects bothcurrent and future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
TheStatement of comprehensive income of the Company has been omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 oftheCompanies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across all Group entities for the purposes of producing these consolidated financialstatements.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial statements 111 C Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control, as defined by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: Power over the investee ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances inassessing whether it has power over an investee, including: Rights arising from other contractual arrangements: and The Groups voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements of control.
3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is an investment entity and, as such, does not consolidate the investment entities it controls.
Most of the Groups interests in subsidiaries are recognised as fair value through profit or loss, and measured at fair value.
This represents a change in accounting policy in the current year, more details of which are provided in Notes 14, 15 and 32.
Those subsidiaries which provide investment related services, such as advisory, management or employment services are not classified at fair value through profit and loss and continue to beconsolidated unless they additionally make investments, in which case they are fair valued.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Investments that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value even though the Group may have significant influence over those companies.
iii Joint ventures Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Groups investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
iv Composition of the Group The Group is made up of several different types of subsidiaries.
The Group re-assesses the function performed by each type of subsidiary to determine its treatment under the IFRS 10 exemption from consolidation.
The types of subsidiaries and their treatment under IFRS 10 are as follows: General Partners GPs Consolidated General Partners provide investment management services and do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets.
These entities are not investment entities.
Investment managers advisers Consolidated These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice.
They do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets.
Investment managers advisers which also hold investments Fair valued These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and also hold investments in assets held for capital appreciation.
These entities are classified as investment entities and therefore are held at fair value.
Holding companies of investment managers advisers Consolidated These entities provide investment related services through their subsidiaries.
They do not hold any direct investment in portfolio assets and these entities are not investment entities.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 112 Financial statements Significant accounting policies Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures Fair valued The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through its ultimate parent company as well as through other limited partnership and corporate subsidiaries which the Group has created to align the interests of the investment teams with the performance of the assets through the use ofvarious carried interest schemes.
The purpose of these limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles, many of which also provide investment related services, is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation.
These partnerships meet the definition of an investment entity and are classified at fair value through the profit and loss.
Portfolio investments Fair valued Following the introduction of IFRS 10, the test for accounting subsidiaries has been altered to take wider factors of control as well as actual equity ownership into account.
This has resulted in 36 investments being classified as accounting subsidiaries.
In accordance with the investment entity exception, these entities have been held at fair value with movements in fair value going through the profit and loss account.
Further details can be found in Note 13.
With one exception Palace Street I none of these subsidiaries are a UK Companies Act subsidiary.
Structured entities Fair valued The Group has interests in a number of unconsolidated structured entities, their current carrying value and a description of their activities isincluded in Note 32.
D Income Gross investment return is equivalent to revenue for the purposes of IAS 1.
It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment portfolio net of deal-related costs and includes foreign exchange movements in respect of the investment portfolio.
Investment income is analysed into the following components: a Realised profits or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start ofthe accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
b U nrealised profits or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and endof the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
c Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries are the movement in the carrying value of group subsidiaries which are classified as investment entities under IFRS 10.
The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through these entities which are usually limited partnerships or corporate subsidiaries.
d P ortfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments.
It is recognised to the extent that itisprobable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must bemetbefore the income is recognised: Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets carrying value.
When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of a loan the Group recognises a provision against any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the investment is assessed to have recovered in value.
Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment.
Fees that areearned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised when that investment is made.
Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are recognised as that service is provided.
e Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the Group entity.
Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
At each subsequent reporting date investments are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial statements 113 E Exchange differences i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of the Group entity entering into the transaction are translated at the exchange rateruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated tosterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling using exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of non-sterling operations The assets and liabilities of operations whose functional currency is not sterling, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of these operations are translated to sterling atrates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised inother comprehensive income and accumulated within a separate component of equity, the Translation reserve, and are released upon disposal ofthe non-sterling operation.
In respect of non-sterling operations, cumulative translation differences on the consolidation of non-sterling operations are being accumulated fromthe date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004, and not from the original acquisition date.
F Treasury assets and liabilities Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and overall costs of borrowing.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions ofthe instrument.
fide-recognition occurs when rights to cash flows from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three monthsor less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net ofbank overdrafts.
ii Deposits Deposits in the balance sheet comprise longer-term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months.

Services provided by the Groups auditors During the year the Group obtained the following services from the Groups auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
The amounts below are recognised onanInvestment basis as this discloses all of the fees paid to the auditors: 2014 2013 m m Audit services Statutory audit Company 1.3 1.3 UK subsidiaries 0.5 0.5 Overseas subsidiaries 0.2 0.2 Audit-related regulatory reporting 2.0 2.0 Non-audit services Other assurance services 0.2 0.2 Investment due diligence 0.2 0.1 Tax services compliance and advisory services 0.1 0.1 2.5 2.4 Non-audit services These services are services that could be provided by a number of firms and include general consultancy work.
Work is allocated to the auditors only if it does not impact the independence of the audit firm.
In addition to the above, Ernst & Young LLP has received fees from investee companies.
It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP receive less than 20% of the total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.
Ernst & Young LLP also acts as auditor to the 3i Group Pension Plan.
The appointment of the auditors to this Plan and the fees paid in respect of the audit are agreed by the trustees who act independently from the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension scheme during the year were less than 0.1 million 2013: less than 0.1 million.

Under the Investment basis, the average number of employees during the year was 277 2013: 358.
Under IFRS, the average number of employees during the year was 269 2013: 266 which reflects that a number of employees are employed by investment entity subsidiaries.
Wages and salaries shown above include salaries paid in the year, bonuses and portfolio incentive schemes relating to the year.
These costs are included in operating expenses.

The Group has equity-settled and cash settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees.
Equity settled schemes are measured atfair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc.
Thecharge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
They are fair valued at each reporting date.
The cost of cash settled share-based payment transactions are adjusted for the forfeitures ofthe participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments.
The cost of the sharebased payments is allocated either to operating expenses bonuses or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award.
Executive Director Long Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.

3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 120 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 7 Share-based payments continued The features of the Groups share schemes are set out on pages 87 to 102.
For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may begranted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2014 is 4 million 2013: 2 million.
The intrinsic value of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions which have vested by 31 March 2014 is nil 2013: nil.
The following information shows details of the share-based payment awards made during the year.

Due to a significant loss onreturn in the first year, the minimum vesting hurdle of a 10% Group return on opening equity over three years is not expected to be achieved.
Share awards Details of share awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 2014 2013 Outstanding at the start of the year 13,773,834 16,698,893 Granted 6,058,327 2,746,884 Exercised 1,503,366 171,087 Lapsed 874,032 5,500,856 Outstanding at the end of year 17,454,763 13,773,834 The awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average contractual life of 4.74 years 2013: 6.95 years.
The cost of share awards isspread over the vesting period of two to four years.
A summary of the vesting conditions of share awards is as follows: Performance share awards market condition The performance condition for Performance shares issued before July 2011 is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value ofashareholding in the Company with dividends reinvested for the three-year performance period from grant averaged over a 60-day period compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested adjusted for mergers, demergers and fide-listings over that period.
Performance share awards non market condition Performance shares issued after June 2011 will vest, subject to a vesting scale, if the annualised growth of the Groups return on opening equity during the three-year performance period equals or exceeds 10% per annum.
Performance-based awards Performance-based share awards are made to certain investment executives.
These plans operate in a similar format to a carry scheme where apercentage of shares will vest once a realised profit hurdle has been achieved on a defined group of assets.
Deferred bonus plan Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as a conditional award of shares which vest either in equal tranches annually over three or four years or at the end of three years.
The awards are not subject to a performance condition.
The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at the date of the award.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial statements 121 Share Incentive Plan Eligible UK employees may participate in a HM Revenue and Customs approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest inthe Companys shares.
Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition.
During the year participants invested up to 125 per month from their pre-tax salaries in the Companys shares referred to as partnership shares.
For each share so acquired the Company grants two free additionalshares referred to as matching shares which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed other than forcertain permitted reasons within three years of grant.
From 6 April 2014 the limit has been increased to 150 per month.
Employee Trust The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds shares in 3i Group plc which can be used to meet its obligations under certain share schemes.
The Trustee has full discretion as to the application of trust assets.
However, in accordance with IFRS 10, 3i Group plc is considered the ultimate controlling party for accounting purposes and the operations of the 3i Group Employee Trust are consolidated by the Group.
8 Retirement benefits Accounting policy: Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations beingcarried out at each balance sheet date.
Interest on the net defined benefit liability asset, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation, is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full astheyarise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds thefairvalue of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefitobligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
Retirement benefit plans i Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group.
The employees of the Groups subsidiaries in France are members of a state managed retirement benefit plan operated by the countrys government.
3i Europe plcs French branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund these benefits.
The total expense recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is 3 million 2013: 4 million, which represents the contributions payable tothese plans.
There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
ii Defined benefit plans The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK the Plan.
The Plan is approved byHMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment is determined by the Plans documentation.
The Plan is subject to UK funding regulations, which require the Group and the Trustees to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule where necessary.
The Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.
The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent ofthe Companys finances and are administered by the Trustees.
The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the Plans assets and for monitoring the Plans funding position.
As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to fide-risk the Plan through changes toits investment policy.
IAS 19 Revised became effective for accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2013, and as a result prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the standard.
The main effect is that the expected returns on pension scheme assets and the interest cost on defined benefit obligations have been replaced by interest on the net defined benefit liability asset, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
These amendments have been retrospectively applied and the prior period comparative figures restated accordingly.
The result of this is a 4 million increase in interest payable and a 4 million increase in re-measurement gain included in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2013.
The estimated effect on the current period figures is an increase in interest payable of 4 million and an increase in re-measurement gain of 4 million.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 122 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 8 Retirement benefits continued The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2014.
This included an update tothemembership data as part of the full triennial actuarial valuation effective date 30 June 2013 that was completed in March 2014.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service.
3i Deutschland GmbH and the German and Spanish branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employees investment policy should it arise.
The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is 1 million 2013:3 million and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is 15 million 2013: 17 million.
The amounts recognised in profit loss for the year and other comprehensive income for these schemes are a 1 million expense 2013: 1 million expense and a 1 million gain 2013: 3 million expense respectively.
The amount recognised in the Statement of financial position in respect of the Groups defined benefit plans are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Present value of funded obligations 687 720 Fair value of the Plan assets 898 904 Asset restriction 74 64 Retirement benefit surplus in respect of the Plan 137 120 Retirement benefit deficit in respect of other defined benefit schemes 14 14 The asset restriction relates to tax that would be deducted at source in respect of a refund of the Plan surplus.

The Plan assets do not include any of the Groups own equity instruments nor any property in use by the Group.
Changes in the asset restriction were as follows: 2013 2014 restated m m Opening asset restriction 64 49 Interest on asset restriction 3 2 Re-measurements 7 13 Closing asset restriction 74 64 The asset restriction relates to tax that would be deducted at source in respect of a refund of the Plan surplus.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.5% 4.4% Expected rate of salary increases 5.9% 5.8% Expected rate of pension increases 3.5% 3.4% Retail Price Index RPI inflation 3.4% 3.3% Consumer Price Index CPI inflation 2.4% 2.6% In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at the previous actuarial valuation with an allowance for the terms to increase in future.
Following the completion of the full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2013, thelatest conversion terms have been reflected in the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2014.
The impact of allowing for the latest conversion terms has been to increase the defined benefit obligation by around 13 million.
The duration of the Plans defined benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 21 years.
The financial assumptions adopted are appropriate for a pension scheme with the Plans maturity.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 124 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 8 Retirement benefits continued The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2014 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% 31 March 2013: 80% of the PNA00 tables allowing for improvements from 2000 in line with the CMI 2009 core projections with a long-term annual rate of future improvement of1.5%.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2034 2013: 2033 is projected to be 33.3 2013: 33.2 years compared to 31.0 2013:30.7 years for someone reaching 60 in 2014.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Increase by 9 million Retail Price Index RPI inflation Increase by 0.1% Increase by 8 million Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 11 million The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its defined benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plans assets may reduce the value of the defined benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.
Toreduce the volatility of the Plans assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plans equity holdings byswitching them to bonds over time.
The Plans assets are also diversified across different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans IAS 19 defined benefit obligation.
However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets incorporate bonds and so any increase in the defined benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans assets.
Inflation risk The Plans defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets areeither unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation could reduce or eliminate the defined benefitsurplus.
Life expectancy The Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plansdefined benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011 the Group ceased to make regular contributions tothePlan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014.
The results of that valuation showed that the plan had an actuarial surplus of 1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group is not required to make contributions to the Plan at this time.
The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 31, remains in place.
The next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise will be based on the financial position as at 30 June 2016.

In such circumstances this is achieved by the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured to the fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The valuation technique incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and interest rates as inputs, and uses present value calculations.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and exchange rates.
This represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value of financial instruments aretaken to the Statement of comprehensive income.
2013 2014 restated m m Interest rate swaps 11 8 Forward foreign exchange contracts 1 2 10 6 Exchange movements in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts are included within exchange movements in the Statement of comprehensiveincome.
During the year, a 12 million gain 2013: 11 million loss was recognised in exchange movements in relation to forward foreign exchangecontracts.
Also during the year, the only residual long-term interest rate swap was closed out.
11 Carried interest and performance fees payable Accounting policy: Carried interest receivable The Group earns a share of profits carried interest receivable from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties.
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest receivable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achievedif the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and ismeasured at the balance sheet date.
An accrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking intoaccount the cash already returned tofund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management funds.
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable made once the performance conditions in the scheme have been met.
Carried interest payable The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments.
Carried interest payable istheterm used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest schemes.
Carriedinterest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved iftheremainingassets in that scheme were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of theperformance conditions in place in the carried interest scheme, discounted to reflect the likely actual cash payment date, which may bemateriallylater than the time of the accrual.
Under IFRS 10, where carry payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through Fairvaluemovements on investment entity subsidiaries.
An additional 69 million of carry payable was recognised in these entities 2013: 5 million reduction.

Tax is charged or credited in the Statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the Statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit temporary differences, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Where there are taxable differences arising on investments insubsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax liabilities are recognised except where the Group is able to control reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
However, where there are deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that both the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill and other assets andliabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

An investment trust is exempt from tax on capital gains, therefore the Groups capital return will be largely non-taxable.
Including 3 million of tax charges incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was 5 million.
Under the Investment basis presentation, ofthe 5 million total tax charge, 1 million has been recognised as a reduction of realised profits and 1 million as a reduction in value growth because these tax charges relate to two specific overseas investments.

It is unlikely that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% 2013: 23%.
3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 128 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 13 Investment portfolio Accounting policy: Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require thedelivery or settlement of the investment.
The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of investment income andcapital appreciation from changes in the fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value ismeasured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines IPEV, details ofwhich are available in Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 156 to 158.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair valueon a different basis, applying 3i Groups valuation policies.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan balance.
The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year.
If the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a provision against any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward.
Capitalisation at nil value is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for.
These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction in portfolio value.
As a result of the early adoption of IFRS 10, and the exemption from consolidation, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Groups unconsolidated subsidiaries is now presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities.
A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 14.

The fair value hierarchy also applies to derivative financial instruments, see Note 20 forfurther details, and to Investments in investment entities, see Note 14 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entitys net asset value with the significant part being attributable to the underlying portfolio.
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments with any other assets or liabilities within investment entities fair valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.

The transfer of equity from Level 3 to Level 1 reflects the IPO of Quintiles on 14 May 2013.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
Areasonable alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted.
This would have a positive impact on the directly held unquoted investment portfolio of 111 million 2013: 84 million or 9% 2013: 6%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of 19 million 2013: 43 million or 1% 2013: 3%.

This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process.
TheGroups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
For the Group, this Note has been prepared using figures from the Investment basis financial statements as this provides the user with a more comprehensive reflection of the financial risks of the Group and is consistent with how Management assess and manage risk.
An explanation andreconciliation of the Investment basis to IFRS is shown in the Strategic report on pages 53 to 57.
For the Company, this Note has been prepared on an IFRS basis.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, long-term borrowings and shareholders equity.
The type andmaturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in Note 21.
Capital is managed with the objective of maximising long-term return toshareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development ofthebusiness.

2 Includes derivative financial liabilities of 4 million for 2014 and 60 million in 2013.
B shares of 6 million, in 2014 and 2013 are also included in this figure.
Capital constraints The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with sufficient reserves to meet local statutory regulatory obligations.
No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FCA.
The last submission to the FCA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FCAs prudential rules.
The Groups capital requirement is updated regularly following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3iInvestments plc.
The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FCA and remains at a significant regulatory capital surplus.
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.
Financial risks Concentration risk The Groups exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the investment and treasury and funding sections in the Risk section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in Note 1, Segmental analysis, and inthe25large investments table on pages 154 and 155. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, derivatives cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety ofcounterparties with circa 87% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with3isrelationship banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Loan impairments are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases an appropriate loan impairment is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

TheGroups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is primarily being managed through a reduction in gross debt as noted in the Risk section.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small as the Groups outstanding debt is fixed rate.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of 8 million 2013: 21 million increase forthe Group and 6 million 2013: 22 million increase for the Company.
This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable oncashand deposits.
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and all other currencies combined is shown inthe table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group and Companys net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The Group considers currency risk on specific investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over time.
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided on page 49 in the Financial review section.

The Investment Committees role in risk management is discussed further in the Risk section.

In the prior year the Group announced a change to its hedging strategy and continued to reduce its use of derivatives to hedge exchange movements on its US dollar and euro portfolio.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 112 million 2013: 481 million.
Interest rate swaps The Group closed out its remaining interest rate derivative during the year.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in Note 13, derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs, as described in Note 10.
21 Loans and borrowings Accounting policy: All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities.
Group Group 2013 Company Company 2014 restated 2014 2013 m m m m Loans and borrowings are repayable as follows: Within one year 164 In the second year In the third year 274 274 In the fourth year 280 280 In the fifth year After five years 575 575 575 575 849 1,019 849 855 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 140 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 21 Loans and borrowings continued Principal borrowings include: Group 2013 Company Company Group 2014 restated 2014 2013 m m m Rate Maturity m Issued under the 2,000m note issuance programme Fixed rate 200m notes public issue 6.875% 2023 200 200 200 200 400m notes public issue 5.750% 2032 375 375 375 375 350m notes public issue 5.625% 2017 274 280 274 280 849 855 849 855 Committed multi-currency facilities 50m LIBOR 1.50% 2016 450m LIBOR 1.00% 2016 164 164 Total loans and borrowings 849 1,019 849 855 The Group is subject to a financial covenant on its committed multi-currency facilities, the Asset Cover Ratio, defined as total assets including cash divided by loans and borrowings plus derivative financial liabilities.
All of the Groups borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates.
None of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group.
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is 942 million 2013: 1,087 million, determined withreference to their published market prices which are included within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Gross debt also includes the liabilities relating to the Groups B shares and net liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments.
22 Provisions Accounting policy: Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable thatthe Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made.
The provisions are measured attheDirectors best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect ismaterial.
Changes in provisions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income for the period.

Most of the provision is expected to be utilised in the next year.
The Group has a number of leasehold properties whose rent and unavoidable costs exceed the economic benefits expected to be received.
These costs arise over the period of the lease, and have been provided for to the extent they are not covered by income from subleases.
The leases covered by the provision have a remaining term of up to 13 years.
23 Trade and other payables Accounting policy: Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in respect of goods or services received up to the balance sheet date.

The Group has entered into agreements to purchase the remaining 37% of the equity of 3i Debt Management Limited and 20% of 3i Debt Management US LLC, currently owned by management, over the next four years.
They are incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales unless otherwise stated.
The introduction of IFRS 10 has resulted in a reassessment of the accounting subsidiaries of the Group.
IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for anentity to be classified as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control issues, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries.
Under IFRS 10, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee andhas the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary.
This is counter to the UK Companies Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries, with alarger than 50% holding of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary.
The accounting treatment of each subsidiary above is noted in the table, with 3i Debt Management Limited and 3i Debt Management Investments Limited being fair valued with movements recognised in the profit and loss as a result of the implementation of IFRS 10.
As at 31 March 2014, the entire issued share capital of 3i Holdings plc and 63% of the issued share capital of 3i Debt Management Limited was held bythe Company.
The entire issued share capital of all the other principal subsidiary undertakings listed in the table above and 80% of 3i Debt Management US LLC was held by subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
In addition, under the application of IFRS 10, 36 of the portfolio investments are now considered to be accounting subsidiaries.
As per the investment entity exception under IFRS 10, these are all held at fair value with movements shown in the profit and loss.
The largest 25 portfolio companies byfairvalue are detailed on page 154 and 155.
The combination of the table opposite and that on pages 154 and 155 are deemed by the Directors tofulfil theIFRS 12 disclosure of material subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that the number of undertakings in respect of which the Company is required to disclose information under Schedule 4 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 is such that compliance would result in information of excessive length being given.
Full information will be annexed to the Companys next annual return.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 from the requirements todeliver to the Register of Companies and publish the accounts of those limited partnerships included in the consolidated accounts of the Group.
