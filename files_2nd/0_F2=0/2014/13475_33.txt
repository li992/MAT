b Refer to note 1 d. c Equity issued to holders of non-controlling interest in 2014 include US$1,158 million of proceeds from a rights issue by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd in January 2014. d Rio Tinto gained control of the non-Oyu Tolgoi LLC OT assets of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd on 24 January 2012 when its share reached 51 per cent.
Within newly consolidated operations for 31 December 2012, US$2,678 million represents non-controlling interests in the non-OT assets, of which US$1,439 million is the 49 per cent non-controlling interest in net loans receivable from Rio Tinto Group companies.
Refer to note 37. e Rio Tinto acquired a controlling interest in Richards Bay Minerals RBM in 2012, with consolidation effective from 3 September 2012 the acquisition date.
US$224 million within newly consolidated operations relates to the fair value of non-controlling interests at the acquisition date.
Refer to note 37. f The majority of the adjustments to equity interest held by Rio Tinto in 2012 arose from the acquisition by a consortium led by Chalco of shares in Simfer Jersey Limited, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, as set out in the Simandou Joint Development Agreement.
Chalco made a payment of US$1.35 billion on 24 April 2012 in exchange for an equity interest of 47 per cent in Simfer Jersey, reimbursing Rio Tinto for historic project costs.
The transfer on 24 April 2012 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$1.05 billion, relating to the amount received over Rio Tintos carrying value of the interest transferred.
g Equity issued to holders of non-controlling interests in 2012 include US$0.9 billion of proceeds from a rights offering by Turquoise Hill, and cash calls of US$480 million following the transfer described in f, which resulted in the Chalco consortium being issued with additional equity interest in proportion to its interest.
com STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRODUCTION, RESERVES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND OPERATIONS Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as defined in note 1, which differs in certain respects from the version of International Financial Reporting Standards that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards AAS.
Prior to 1 January 2004, the Groups financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, as defined in note 1, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Groups UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated.
This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1.
The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity.
As a consequence, shareholders funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$553 million at 31 December 2014 2013: US$550 million.
Save for the exception described above, the Groups financial statements drawn up in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.
Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements The Rio Tinto Group These are the financial statements of the Group formed through the merger of economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited Merger, and presented by both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited as their consolidated accounts in accordance with both UK and Australian legislation and regulations.
Merger terms On 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, which are listed respectively on Stock Exchanges in the UK and Australia, entered into a dual listed companies DLC merger.
This was effected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plcs Memorandum and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limiteds Constitution.
As a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role.
In particular, the arrangements: confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups: provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure: provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions: and provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure in which the public shareholders of the two companies effectively vote on a joint basis.
The merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each company of one special voting share to a trustee company which provides the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders.
During 2002, each of the parent companies issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure.
Accounting standards The financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with IFRS as defined in note 1.
The Merger was accounted for as a merger under UK GAAP.
As permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS, which are set out in IFRS 1, the Group did not restate business combinations that occurred before the transition date of 1 January 2004.
As a result, the DLC merger of economic interests described above continues to be accounted for as a merger under IFRS as defined in note 1.
The main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the balance sheet of the merged Group includes the assets and liabilities of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, rather than at their fair values at the date of the merger.
For accounting purposes Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single public parent company withtheir respective public shareholders being the shareholders in that single company.
As a result the amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders are included in the amounts attributed to owners of Rio Tinto on the balance sheet, income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Australian Corporations Act The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC on 9 January 2015.
The main provisions of the order are that the financial statements are prepared in accordance withthe principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union EU IFRS and include a reconciliation from EU IFRS to the Australian equivalents of IFRS see above.
