We have therefore introduced an Investment basis set of primary financial statements, prepared on a similar basis Since the adoption of IFRS in the year ended 31 March 2006, tothe prior year financial statements, fair valuing portfolio there has been discussion about whether investment companies at the level which we believe provides the most companies such as 3i should be exempt from consolidation understandable financial information and consolidating ofits investments the direct and indirectly held portfolio associated transactions on a line-by-line basis.
IFRS 10 has resolved this point with the introduction of an investment entity exception confirming that A detailed reconciliation from the Investment basis to IFRS portfolio companies should be accounted for at fair value, basis of the Statement of comprehensive income, Statement which is an excellent outcome.
This is why we have decided to of financial position, and Cash flow statement is provided on adopt the standard early.

In the Investment basis accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior periods.
Theadjustments simply reclassify the Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under the Investment basis and the IFRSbasis.
2 R ealised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by3iGroup plc and not those portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries.
Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries line.
This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts.
3 O ther items also aggregated into the Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.
4 F oreign exchange on investments has been reclassified as a result of IFRS 10.
This is because the revaluation of assets held by investment entitysubsidiaries will now be reflected in the fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries rather than being reflected as exchange movements.
Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations has reduced given that many foreign operations are now treated asinvestment entities held at fair value rather than consolidated subsidiaries.
5 W e have also taken this opportunity to re-present the impact of foreign exchange movements on our returns to be consistent with the current hedging policy.
Foreign exchange on investments is now included in our gross investment return to show the currency risk relating to the portfolio more directly.
6 T he Credit Opportunities Fund Palace Street I was previously consolidated on a line-by-line basis and is now recognised as a fair value investment entity subsidiary under IFRS 10.
We believe this is the appropriate treatment that effectively shows the performance of the Fund andhave applied the same basis to the Investment basis statements in a change to previous presentation.

3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 56 Strategic report Reconciliation of Statement offinancial position Notes: 1 A pplying IFRS 10 to the Statement of financial position aggregates the line items of a number of previously consolidated subsidiaries into the single line item Investments in investment entities.
In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as iftheinvestment entity subsidiaries were consolidated, consistent with prior periods.
The adjustment reclassifies items in the Statement of financial position.
There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is significantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the Investments in investment entities line.
We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments, unquoted equity investments or loans and receivables.
Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates theseitems.
2 C ash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the Investments in investment entities line.
At 31 March 2014, 36million of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classified as investment entity subsidiaries and is therefore included in the Investments in investment entities line.
3 I ntercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis.
If an investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset orliability of the investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Statement of financial position of the Group.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would have been eliminated on consolidation.
4 T he Credit Opportunities Fund Palace Street I was previously classified as a current asset and, following the adoption of IFRS 10, has been reclassified as non-current in both the Investment basis and IFRS statements.
5 I nvestment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.

Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash flow statement on a look through basis, in order to reflect the underlying sources and uses of cash flows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 T here is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial statements because there are cash balances held in investment entity subsidiary vehicles.
Cash held within investment entity subsidiaries willnotbe shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
