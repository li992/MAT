INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: As at 31 December 2014 2013 $m $m Branded 199 209 Injectables: 83 32 MSI 32 32 Bedford 51 Oncology 32 37 Total 314 278 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations are based on cash flows over five years and then grown at 2% in perpetuity.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and compound annual cash flow growth rate for the five-year business plan.
Management estimates discount rates using WACC rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The discount rates used varied between 9.0% and 38.6% based on the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The compound annual cash flow growth rates range 4.1% decline to 27.9% growth.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
While there is some uncertainty regarding the short-term impact of the political events in MENA, the Group does not consider that the likelihood of impairment losses in the long-term has increased.
