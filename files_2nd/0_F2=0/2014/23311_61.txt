Taxation As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
As the Company invests principally in UK equities, it has little overseas tax and the overseas tax charge is the result of withholding tax deducted at source.
This note also clarifies the basis for the Company to have no deferred tax asset or liability.

d Factors that may affect future tax changes The Company has surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships of 389,865,000 2013: 358,111,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 77,973,000 2013: 82,365,000, measured at the standard corporation tax rate of 20% 2013: 23%, has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since the Directors believe that there will be no taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax assets can be offset.
