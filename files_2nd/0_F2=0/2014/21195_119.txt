As a result of these arrangements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfill their obligations.
The Company's maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately $1,224 million as at 31 December 2014 2013: $1,119 million.
Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability.
This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the life insurance industry compensation plan.
As at 31 December 2014, no information has come to the Company's attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in life insurers from which it has purchased annuities and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.
f Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
There are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties.
In addition, certain of the Companys assets are charged in favour of certain of its subsidiaries as security for intra-Group loans.
The Groups insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate.
Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.
