NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17.
Financial risk management In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to gold price, currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
Controlling risk in the group The treasury committee is responsible for treasury financial risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparties, limits, instruments and any hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made, one of whom needs to be an executive director.
Unless specific dispensation is obtained from the audit committee, the treasury committee is permitted to invest up to $50 million or 20% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with an investment rating of AAor higher noting that no institution can exceed $100 million.
The treasury committee is also permitted to invest up to $12.5 million or 5% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with an investment rating above A but below AA-, provided that no investment exceeds $25 million.
Approximately half of the cash for the group was held with the groups principal bankers at year end with the remainder held with more than 2 other financial institutions as per the treasury policy.
The treasury committee is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury committee monitors adherence to treasury risk management policy and counterparty limits and provides regular reports to the board.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: Safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk: Effective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures: Ensuring that investment and any hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparties: and Ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated consistently throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
The group continues to hold material TVA receivable balances.
While management continue to pursue recovery of the TVA in cash, it is recognised that in practice given the continued absence of payment, the TVA may only be recovered through the tax offset mechanism set out in the mining convention.
Management reports the TVA position and movements on a quarterly basis to the audit committee.
Refer to Risk Factors in the annual report for details on the groups risk factors.
Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily euro, South African rand and Communaut Financire Africaine franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks and none existed in 2012 or 2013.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and gold was sold at market spot prices in 2013 and 2014.
Gold sales are made in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
The group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates.

Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 235 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate and liquidity risk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
The company entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility, which doubled the size of facilities available to $400.0 million, on similar terms to the previous facility and which matures in December 2018 and is at present undrawn.
The company drew down and repaid $50.0 million of the facility in the year.
Based on the companys current cash resources and facilities, projected operating cash flows and capital expenditure, the company is confident it will be able to meet its financial obligations at the prevailing gold price.
The facility, if drawn, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, at the lower end of the leverage grid and includes financial covenants in respect of EBIT, EBITDA, net finance charges, tangible net worth, total debt, debt cover and interest cover.

Concentration of credit risk The groups cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali and Cte dIvoire and in the case of its joint ventures in DRC and Mali.
The gold produced is sold to the largest accredited gold refinery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the refinery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk on gold sales, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
While not financial assets for IFRS 7, included in receivables is $106.8 million 2013: $129.9 million refer to note 7 relating to indirect taxes owing to Loulo, Gounkoto and Tongon by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA, which holds some credit risk for the group.
The legally binding mining conventions in Mali permit offsetting of other corporate taxes against approved unpaid TVA.
A further $50.5 million 2013: $36.4 million is held within the underlying statement of financial position of the equity accounted Kibali joint venture which is considered recoverable given the receipts obtained during the year and absence of significant disputed items, albeit receipts, remain slow.
Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, buyback shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt net cash divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt net cash.
