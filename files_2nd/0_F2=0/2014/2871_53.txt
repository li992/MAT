We have calculated our post-tax WACC assuming a risk-free rate of 1.75%, a market risk premium of 8.3% and a Beta of 0.8.

This has been done by adjusting the rate, where appropriate, to reflect the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.

The impairment testing as described is reliant on the accuracy of managements forecasts and the assumptions that underlie them and also on the selection of the discount and growth rates to be applied.
In order to gauge the sensitivity of the result to a change in any one, or combination of 17 Business combinations the assumptions that underlie the model, a number of scenarios have been run to measure which CGUs are the most susceptible to an impairment 2014 acquisitions should the assumptions used be varied.
The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2014 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: The sensitivity analysis on CGU cash flows has been carried out using a 100bps increase in the pre-tax discount rate, a 100bps reduction in growth Fair value rates, and a 100bps decrease in CGU year 1 operating margins between 2% and 33% impact on margins depending on CGU.
to Group recognised on The Insurance Services CGU, as reported previously, is the most sensitive to a change in a single or combination of assumptions and therefore profit acquisition and profit margins are closely monitored.
The headroom in the base case impairment test is 4m: the key assumptions driving this are stated above, m together with a year 1 operating margin of 13%.
The resulting impairment of goodwill of a 100bps adverse change in: the operating margin is 13m: Property, plant and equipment 11.6 the discount rate 4m: the growth rates applied 4m: and a combination of a 100bps adverse change in all, would be 41m.
Intangible assets 159.6 Trade and other receivables due in less than one year 56.6 Other smaller CGUs, which are not material to the Group, are also sensitive to changes in the assumptions, but movements would be immaterial.
Management continue to monitor closely the performance of all CGUs.
