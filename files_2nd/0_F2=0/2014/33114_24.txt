For properties undergoing refurbishment or redevelopment these are currently being used for business accommodation in their current state.
However, the valuation is based on the current valuation at the balance sheet date including the impact of the potential refurbishment and redevelopment as this represents the highest and best use.
The Executive management team and the Board both conduct a detailed review of each property valuation to ensure appropriate assumptions have been applied.
Meetings are held with the valuers to review and challenge the valuations, ensuring they have considered all relevant information, and rigorous reviews are performed to ensure valuations are sensible.
Overview 01-15Strategy 16-21Performance 22-36Governance 37-77 Financial statements 78-119 Shareholder information 120-125 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 95 The valuation of like-for-like properties which are not subject to refurbishment or redevelopment is based on the income capitalisation method which applies market-based yields to the estimated rental values ERVs of each of the properties.
Yields are based on current market expectations depending on the location and use of the property.
ERVs are based on estimated rental potential considering current rental streams, market comparatives, occupancy and timing of rent reviews.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, the significant inputs are deemed unobservable under IFRS 13.
When valuing properties being refurbished by Workspace, the residual value method is used.
The completed value of the refurbishment is determined as for like-for-like properties above.
Capital expenditure required to complete the building is then deducted and a discount factor is applied to reflect the time period to complete construction and allowance made for construction and market risk to arrive at the residual value of the property.
The discount factor used is the property yield that is also applied to the estimated rental value to determine the value of the completed building.
Other risks such as unexpected time delays relating to planned capital expenditure are assessed on a project-by-project basis, looking at market comparable data where possible and the complexity of the proposed scheme.
Redevelopment properties are also valued using the residual value method.
The completed proposed redevelopment which would be undertaken by a residential developer is valued based on the market value for similar sites and then adjusted for costs to complete, developers profit margin and a time discount factor.
Allowance is also made for planning and construction risk depending on the stage of the redevelopment.
If a contract is agreed for the sale redevelopment of the site, the property is valued based on agreed consideration.
For all methods the valuers are provided with information on tenure, letting, town planning and the repair of the buildings and sites.
An increase decrease to ERVs Estimated rental values will increase decrease valuations respectively, while an increase decrease to yields will decrease increase valuations respectively.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market conditions.
An increase decrease in costs to complete and the discount factor will decrease increase valuations respectively.
The reconciliation of the valuation report total to the amount shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as non-current assets, investment properties, is as follows: 2014 2013 m m Total per CBRE valuation report 1,078.0 829.9 Deferred consideration on sale of property note 13 13.2 7.5 Head leases treated as finance leases under IAS 17 3.5 3.5 Total investment properties per balance sheet 1,068.3 825.9 The Groups Investment properties are carried at fair value and under IFRS 13 are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted.
The different valuation methods are as follows: Level 1 Q uoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 U se of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 U se of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
As noted in the Significant Judgements, Key Assumptions and Estimates section, property valuations are complex and involve data which is not publicly available and involves a degree of judgement.
All our investment properties are classified as Level 3, due to the fact that one or more significant inputs to the valuation are not based on observable market data.
If the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes then there could be a transfer between Levels 2 and 3 of classification.
No changes requiring a transfer have occurred during the year.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICY The Group has identified exposure to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Capital risk The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below: A MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Groups interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate and cross currency swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Group has entered into a cross currency swap to ensure the US Dollar liability streams generated from the US Dollar private placement notes are fully hedged into sterling for the life of the transaction.
At 31 March 2014 89% 2013: 79% of Group borrowings were fixed or fixed through the use of interest rate and cross currency swaps.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitors variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of -0.5% would have increased or decreased net interest payable and equity by 0.2m 2013: 0.4m.
B CREDIT RISK The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has approximately 4,000 tenants over approximately 100 properties.
The largest 10 single tenants generate around 6% of net rent roll.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Groups credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months rent on inception of lease as security against default.
Total tenant deposits held are 11.8m 2013: 10.4m.
The Group monitors aged debt balances and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance monitoring process.
The Groups debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
Deferred consideration on the sale of investment property is contractual and valued regularly by the external valuer based on current and future market factors.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due.
This is performed via a variety of methods including daily cash flow review and forecasting, monthly monitoring of the maturity profile of debt and the regular revision of borrowing facilities in relation to the Groups requirements and strategy.
To ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk, the Group has an overdraft facility of 4m and a revolving loan facility of 100m.
At 31 March 2014 headroom excluding overdraft was 70m 31 March 2013: 45m.
Cash flow is monitored formally on a monthly basis as part of internal performance monitoring with regular daily monitoring and forecasting undertaken to manage day-to-day cash flows and any balances which are ring-fenced by lenders.
The Board reviews compliance with loan covenants which include agreed interest cover and loan to value ratios, alongside review of available headroom on loan facilities.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables existing at the balance sheet date.
Contracted cash flows are based upon the loan balances and applicable interest rates payable on these at each year end.

Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises drawings against term loan facilities, revolving loan facilities from banks, the Retail Bond, private placement notes less cash at bank and in hand.
The foreign currency risk on the US Dollar private placement notes is fully hedged through a cross currency swap.
At 31 March 2014 Group equity was 726.1m 2013: 500.4m, and Group net debt debt less cash at bank and in hand was 338.0m 2013: 327.4m.
Following the refinancing in the year the Groups borrowings are now all unsecured.
The loan to value covenants applicable to these borrowings range between 60% and 75% and compliance is being met comfortably.

NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS In December 2009 Workspace acquired full control of its former Workspace Glebe joint venture.
The purchase was satisfied by a cash payment of 15m and a debt facility of 68m provided by the former lenders to the joint venture, with further amounts potentially payable under a proceeds share agreement.
The proceeds share provides for the former lenders to Workspace Glebe to share in net cash proceeds from disposals from the Glebe property portfolio once Workspace has received its priority return.
The priority return at 31 March 2014 is 92m.
For proceeds up to 170m the lenders share is 50%, from 170m up to 200m it is 30% and nil thereafter.
The maximum payable under this proceed share is 48m.
All disposals are at the option of Workspace and there are no time limits.
The total valuation of the Glebe portfolio at 31 March 2014 was 217m 31 March 2013: 164m.
While a number of the assets have residential redevelopment potential a substantial part of the portfolio is comprised of investment properties that Workspace has no current plans to sell.
The current value of the properties that have redevelopment potential and management consider probable to be sold for cash is 107m.
Total proceeds including cash received to date from disposals of 14m would therefore be 121m 31 March 2013: 83m.
It is estimated that net proceeds after costs that would be realised is 114m.
On this basis, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay the lenders 11m at 31 March 2014.
We have reviewed and changed our accounting policy for the Glebe proceeds share agreement.
Previously, the Group considered the proceeds share agreement as a contingent liability, with a provision under IAS 37 only being recognised if the obligation under the agreement was triggered or it was otherwise considered probable that an outflow of economic benefits would be required.
The Group now accounts for the agreement as an equity instrument in accordance with IAS 32 representing a non-controlling interest NCI.
There is no impact of this change in policy on the prior year.
The NCI had an initial fair value on acquisition of nil with no subsequent attributions of profit or distributions until the current year.
The effect in the current year is to recognise a NCI of 11m and a subsequent distribution to the NCI of 11m.
This has resulted in a non-current liability of 11m on the balance sheet see note 19.
Under the previous treatment, the Group would have recognised a provision of 11m in the current year with a corresponding entry through other income and expenses.
This change in policy has no impact on EPRA NAV.
In the highly unlikely scenario that all properties in the Glebe portfolio were sold, the maximum amount payable under the proceeds share agreement of 48m would be due to the lenders 31 March 2013: 32m.
This would be reflected in an increase in the amount attributable to NCI at 31 March 2014 of 37m 31 March 2013: 32m with a net impact of reducing EPRA NAV per share by 25 pence 31 March 2013: 22 pence.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share schemes: I LONG TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP The LTIP scheme is a performance award scheme whereby shares are issued against three Group performance measures which are assessed over the three year vesting period.
These are: Absolute TSR Relative TSR Relative NAV The shares are issued at nil consideration provided the performance conditions are met.
Under the 2013 LTIP scheme 766,728 performance and matching shares were awarded in June 2013 to Directors and senior management 2012 LTIP scheme: 1,163,416.

A binomial model was used to determine the fair value of the LTIP grant for the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR elements of the LTIP scheme.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2013 2013 2014 Nov 2012 June 2012 Share price at grant 405p 306p 227p Exercise price Nil Nil Nil Average expected life years 3 3 3 Risk free rate 0.3% 0.5% 0.5% Expected dividend yield 3% 4% 4% Average share price volatility 31% 41% 41% Fair value per option Absolute TSR element 162p 249p 125p Fair value per option Relative TSR element 148p 172p 128p The relative NAV is a non-market based condition and the intrinsic value is therefore the share price at date of grant of 405 pence.
At each balance sheet date, the Directors assess the likelihood of meeting the conditions under this element of the scheme.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The assessment at year end was that up to 50% of the relative NAV element will vest.
The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a three year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same period.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued II EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES The Group operates a Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme and an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS for which there have been no grants since 2008.
Grants under ESOS were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after three or five years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Details of the movements for the ESOS and SAYE schemes during the year were as follows: ESOS SAYE Weighted Weighted exercise exercise Options outstanding Number price Number price At 1 April 2012 191,171 11.05 483,601 1.26 Options granted 193,992 1.93 Options exercised 328,871 1.15 Options lapsed 139,656 10.34 15,394 1.55 At 31 March 2013 51,515 13.22 333,328 1.74 Options granted 66,147 3.47 Options exercised 39,168 1.63 Options lapsed 18,950 8.25 19,720 2.31 At 31 March 2014 32,565 16.12 340,587 2.06 The exercise of all options, other than those obtained under the Groups SAYE scheme, was dependent upon the Group achieving specified performance targets.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the SAYE options exercised during the year was 4.50 2013: 2.63.
66,147 SAYE share options were granted in the year 2013: 193,992 shares.
The fair value has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Inputs to the model are summarised as follows: 2014 2014 2013 2013 SAYE SAYE SAYE SAYE 3 year 5 year 3 year 5 year Weighted average share price at grant 440p 440p 230p 230p Exercise price 347p 347p 193p 193p Expected volatility 31% 31% 41% 41% Average expected life years 3 5 3 5 Risk free rate 0.3% 0.3% 0.5% 0.5% Expected dividend yield 3% 3% 4% 4% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 25% 25% 25% 25% The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

These shares are held in trust under an HMRC approved SIP.
The shares can be exercised following three years of employment but must be held for a further two years in order to qualify for tax advantages.
There were no grants made in the year 2013: 51,800 shares.
2,920 shares were exercised in the year and 6,424 shares lapsed.
IV YEAR END SUMMARY At 31 March 2014 in total there were 3,071,497 2013: 4,073,483 share awards options exercisable on the Companys ordinary share capital.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued V CASH SETTLED SHARE BASED PAYMENTS National Insurance payments due on the exercise of non-approved ESOS options and shares from the LTIP are considered cash settled share based payments.
The estimated fair value of the National Insurance cash settled share based payments have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
