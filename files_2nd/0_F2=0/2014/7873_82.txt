123 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 4.5 Retirement benefits IMI offers a number of defined benefit arrangements to employees that will not be paid until more than a year after the period in which they are earned, for example pension benefits, jubilee plans, post-employment and other long-term employee benefit arrangements.
There is a significant degree of estimation involved in predicting the ultimate benefits payable under these defined benefit arrangements in respect of which the Group holds net liabilities on its balance sheet.
This section explains how the value of these benefits payable and any assets funding the arrangements are accounted for in the Group financial statements and gives details of the key assumptions upon which the estimations are based.
Assets and liabilities for defined contribution arrangements are minimal as they relate solely to short-term timing differences between the period during which benefits have accrued and when contributions are paid into schemes.
Defined Contribution DC : Arrangements where the employer pays fixed contributions into an external fund on behalf of the employee who is responsible for making the investment decision and therefore assumes the risks and rewards of fund performance.
Contributions to these arrangements are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Defined Benefit: A defined benefit pension plan is a pension arrangement in which the employer promises a specified annual benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employees earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.
In some cases, this benefit is paid as a lump sum on leaving the Company or while in the service of the Company rather than as a pension.
The Group underwrites one or more risks in meeting these obligations and therefore any net liability or surplus in these arrangements in shown on the Group balance sheet.
1 Summary information Net pension deficit: 34.7m 2013: 157.9m The net pension deficit or net liability for defined benefit obligations DBO at 31 December 2014 was 34.7m 2013: 157.9m.
A further nil 2013: 0.8m was recognised in liabilities held for sale.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are aggregated, recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and shown within non-current liabilities or in non-current assets if a scheme is in surplus and it is recoverable.
Number of Defined Benefit arrangements: 64 2013: 74 Ten schemes were divested on 1 January 2014, as part of the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses.
A further scheme in Sweden had its liabilities bought-out on 1 September 2014 via an insurance contract.
In the UK, the IMI Pension Fund commenced winding-up procedures and has been replaced by two new Schemes the UK Funds.
The Group provides pension benefits through a mixture of funded and unfunded defined benefit and defined contribution DC arrangements, although its strategy is to move away from defined benefit arrangements towards defined contribution arrangements wherever possible to minimise the liability of the Group.
Assessments of the obligations of the defined benefit plans are carried out by independent actuaries, based on the projected unit credit method.
An historical split of the types of defined benefit schemes in operation is as follows: Defined Final Salary scheme: The pension available to a member in a final salary % benefit % arrangement will be a proportion of the members salary at or around their Qty Assets of total obligation of total retirement date.
This proportion will be determined by the members length of Type of scheme No.

These assumptions include the discount rate applied to the assets and liabilities, the life expectancy of the members, their expected salary and pension increases and inflation.
The assumptions used for this purpose in these financial statements are summarised below: Weighted Averages 31 Dec 2014 31 Dec 2013 31 Dec 2012 UK Overseas UK Overseas UK Overseas % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Inflation - RPI 3.1 n a 3.5 n a 3.0 n a Inflation - CPI 2.1 1.7 2.5 1.8 2.0 1.9 Discount Rate 3.6 2.1 4.5 3.3 4.3 2.8 Expected salary increases n a 2.2 n a 2.3 n a 2.8 Rate of pension increases 3.1 0.3 3.5 0.5 3.0 0.5 127 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2014 Years 2013 Years 2012 Years Life expectancy at age 65 UK Funds only Current male pensioners 21.2 21.0 20.9 Current female pensioners 24.0 23.9 23.8 Future male pensioners 23.0 22.8 22.7 Future female pensioners 26.0 25.9 25.8 The mortality assumptions used for the UK Funds above reflect its experience, together with an allowance for improvements over time.
The experience was reviewed as part of the formal triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2014, and the assumptions used as at 31 December 2014 and 2013 reflect the results of this review.
The allowance for future improvements in mortality rates from 2014 is in line with the CMIs a research body funded by the actuarial profession to collect and analyse UK mortality rates 2013 Core Projection model, with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% pa.
The table below left illustrates how the UK Funds net pension surplus would decrease excluding the impact of inflation rate and interest rate hedging, as at 31 December 2014, in the event of the following reasonable changes in the key assumptions above.
The table below right shows how the net pension deficit for IMIs non-UK plans would increase, in the event of the following reasonable changes in the key assumptions above.

3.3 Income statement In accordance with IAS19, pension costs recorded through the income statement primarily represent the increase in the defined benefit obligation based on employee service during the year and the interest on the net liability or surplus for defined benefit obligations in respect of employee service in previous years.

Both settlement gains have been treated as exceptional items in the income statement, see section 2.2.

The charges relating to discontinued operations contributed nil 2013: 0.4m to the current service cost, nil 2013: 2.1m to the DC employer contributions and nil 2013: 0.4m to the net finance expense.
