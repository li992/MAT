36 Merger reserve Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
The balance on the reserve of 3,271 million 2013: 3,271 million has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc RAC in 2005.
Because RAC ownership was immediately transferred from Aviva plc to a subsidiary company, this reserve is unaffected by the disposal of RAC in 2011.
