112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 Loans continued Significant judgements and estimates relevant to loans The allowance for impairment losses is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2014 the Group recognised an impairment allowance against loans and advances to customers of 86.1million 2013: 96.8 million.
The impairment allowance is subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the impairment allowance.
However, given the relative size of the Groups mortgage portfolio, a key variable is house prices which determine the collateral value supporting loans in such portfolios.
The value of this collateral is estimated by applying changes in house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
If average house prices had been 10% lower than those estimated at 31 December 2014, the Groups allowance for impairment losses would have been approximately 2.8million higher.
The adequacy of the provision is estimated using models which use a variety of inputs, including recent historical experience toestimate the level of incurred losses in the portfolio.
In certain circumstances adjustments are made to the modelled outcomes to reflect where, in managements judgement, the modelled outcomes are not sufficiently sensitive to current economic conditions.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups impairment allowance included 21.0 million of post model adjustments, the largest component reflecting the effect of the current historical low interest rates environment on customer behaviour.
A collective unimpaired provision is made for loan losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at thebalance sheet date.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the time between the loss event and the date the impairment is specifically identified.
This period is known as the loss emergence period.
During the second half of 2014, the Group extended the loss emergence period on unsecured lending from two months to three months to reflect changes in the time it takes customers to reach impairment which increased the impairment charge by 5.5 million.
Available-for-sale financial assets 2014 2013 million million Gilts 339.7 At 31 December 2014 gilts with a carrying value of 32.9 million were subject to repurchase agreements note 5.
At 31 December 2014 all of the Groups available-for-sale financial assets had a contractual maturity of greater than one year.
Fair value of financial assets The following table summarises the carrying values of financial assets presented on the Groups balance sheet.
The fair values presented in the table are at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement date.

The carrying amount of cash and balances at central banks, items in course of collection from banks and loans and advances tobanks is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
As quoted market prices are not available for the Groups financial instruments, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, whereappropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.

Fair value of financial assets continued Valuation hierarchy of financial assets The table below analyses the fair values of the financial assets of the Group which are carried at fair value or for which fair value is disclosed above.
Total Total carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 fair value value At 31 December 2014 million million million million million Loans and advances to customers 21,451.6 21,451.6 21,641.4 Available-for-sale financial assets 339.7 339.7 339.7 Derivative financial assets 123.1 123.1 123.1 At 31 December 2013 Loans and advances to customers 19,888.4 19,888.4 20,099.1 Derivative financial assets 99.4 99.4 99.4 The Group provides loans and advances at both fixed and variable rates.
Fair value is principally estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
Available-for-sale financial assets are valued using quoted market prices.
The Groups derivative financial assets are all interest rate swaps and are valued using a discounted cash flow model where the most significant input is interest yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
