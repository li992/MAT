The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the currentenvironment.
The Group monitors existing equity in issuance on the basis of the net debt EBITDA ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 15 to 17.
The net debt EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net debt EBITDA ratio together with existing shares in issuance provides an efficient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 26 January 2014, the net debt EBITDA ratio was 0.05 times year ended 26 January 2013: 0.61 times.
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
In the financial year ended 26 January 2014, ROCE increased to 22.4% from 20.5% restated.
25 Retirement benefit obligations During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
Under the defined benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
Defined benefit scheme: actuarial valuation The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
A full valuation of the defined benefit scheme was conducted as at 5 April 2011 using the attained age method.
A surplus of 2,300,000 was determined at the valuation date with total assets valued at 81,825,000.
The defined benefit scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Company and the board of trustees.
The board of trustees is composed of representatives from the company scheme members as set out in the plans rules.
Defined benefit scheme: IAS 19 information The full actuarial valuation carried out at 5 April 2011 was updated to 26 January 2014 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the defined benefit schemes has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.

G. BARR p. l. c. 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Whilst updating the valuation of the Groups retirement benefit obligation for the interim financial statements, the independent qualified actuary, who advises the Company, identified an error in the model used to calculate the retirement benefit deficit as at 26 January 2013.
The impact of this was to understate the retirement benefit assets by 5.0m at 26 January 2013.
The effect on the retirement deficit would have been a movement from a balance of 3.4m, to a surplus of 1.6m at that date.
There was therefore also a corresponding understatement of net deferred tax liabilities of 1.2m at that date.
These misstatements combine to a net understatement of 3.8m of net assets at 26 January 2013.
There has been no impact on the previously reported profit.
Within the context of the Groups balance sheet, and particularly having regard to there being no impact on retained earnings, the Board concluded, in the context of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, that the effect of this error was not sufficiently material to warrant the previously reported comparative figures being restated.
Accordingly, the 5.0m understatement of the retirement benefit asset at 26 January 2013 has been dealt with through the statement of comprehensive income as an addition to the actuarial gain recognised for the year to 26 January 2014.
Asset backed funding arrangement During September 2013 the Company established the A. G. BARR Scottish Limited Partnership the Partnership and through the Partnership has entered into a long term pension funding arrangement with the Pension Scheme.
Under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the Partnership and are being leased back to A. G. BARR p. l. c. under a 21 year lease agreement, generating an income stream of 1.125 million per annum for the pension scheme, increasing annually in line with inflation.
This arrangement fully removes the requirement for any future deficit reduction contributions, which will effectively be replaced by the agreed income stream payments.
The Partnership is controlled by A. G. BARR p. l. c. and its results are consolidated by the Group.
The value of the properties transferred into the Partnership remains included on the Groups balance sheet at their present carrying values with the Group retaining full operational control over these properties.
At the end of the term of the relevant lease, or earlier if the Scheme becomes fully funded to the extent that the members benefits can be secured with an insurance company, the Company has the option to repurchase the properties in the Partnership for an agreed fixed price.

This assumes that the expected age at death for males is 87 to 89 and for females is 89 to 91 depending on their age at 26 January 2014.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 125 Notes to the Accounts Continued 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued The fair value of scheme assets at the year end dates is analysed as follows: 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 000 Equities 49,445 56,829 53,595 55,247 42,521 Bonds 43,137 25,894 24,256 22,087 21,739 Cash 4,585 4,171 4,833 2,172 4,102 Total market value of scheme assets 97,167 86,894 82,954 79,506 68,362 Sensitivity review The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principle assumptions is: Impact on overall liabilities Change in assumption Year to 26 January 2014 Year to 26 January 2013 Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decreases increases liabilities Decreases increases liabilities by 1.9m by 1.7m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increases decreases liabilities Increases decreases liabilities by 1.1m by 1.4m Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increases decreases liabilities Increases decreases liabilities by 2.9m by 2.7m Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses The sensitivities disclosed were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Schemes liabilities.
They have been calculated consistently with last periods disclosures, however these change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.
Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company The nature of the Scheme exposes the Company to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the Scheme in times of adverse experience.
The most financially significant risks are likely to be: Asset volatility The Schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields in line with the requirements of IAS 19R.
If the Scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The plan holds investments in a portfolio of equity and bonds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
The Trustees have made a number of steps to control the level of investment risk within the Scheme over the last 12 months including reducing the overall exposure to equities and diversifying the growth asset mix.
As disclosed above, the Group entered into an asset backed funding arrangement during the year, helping to manage the risk of asset returns through a secure income stream.
The Trustees will continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the Scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities.
In the event of a reduction in the corporate bond yields there will be an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The Schemes obligation is to provide benefits for the life of the members.
An increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Schemes liabilities.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Policy for recognising gains and losses The Company recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately, through the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme or the Company The Scheme does not currently use any specific asset-liability matching strategies.
The Trustees current investment strategy, having consulted with the Company, is to invest circa 60% of the Schemes assets in a mix of equities and diversifying return seeking assets, with the balance in long dated gilts and corporate bonds, in order to strike a balance between: maximising the returns on the Schemes assets: and minimising the risks associated with the lower than expected returns on the Schemes assets.
The Trustees are required to regularly review their investment strategy in light of the revised term and nature of the Schemes liabilities and will be next considering this as part of the triennial actuarial valuation process commencing later this year.
As part of this process the Trustees will be assessing the impact of interest rate and inflation risk and the potential inclusion of asset-liability matching strategies.
Description of funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions The interim Schedule of Contributions dated 1 February 2012 sets out the current contributions payable by the Company to the Scheme.
The Trustees are currently carrying out their next formal valuation, which will be as at 5 April 2014.
As part of that valuation process the Trustees and Company will agree a long term funding strategy, which may include a revision to the Schedule of Contributions to take into account any additional contributions to meet any funding shortfall between the value of the Schemes assets and liabilities.
It is expected that the Trustees Schedule of Contributions will be revised to allow for the rental income stream from the asset backed funding arrangement effectively being a commitment which will offset the requirement for future deficit contributions.
Expected contributions over the next accounting period A. G. BARR p. l. c. expects to contribute approximately 1.2m to the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme in the period ending 25 January 2015, and the Scheme expects to receive further contributions of approximately 1.1m from the asset backed funding arrangement which the Scheme holds an interest in.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years.
The expected maturity analysis of the undiscounted defined benefit pension benefit, estimated on the Schemes funding basis as at 5 April 2011, is as follows: Less than Greater than one year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Proportion of total pension benefits to be paid 1% 1% 3% 95% Defined contribution scheme The pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Defined contribution costs 2,066 1,685 A.
