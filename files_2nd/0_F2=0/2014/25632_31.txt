Employee information continued Key management personnel are defined as persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly, including any director of the Group.
This represents the Group Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee only.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments comprise the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013, Senior Executive Share Scheme, Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Schemes.
JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 The Group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility PDMRs.
The scheme was renewed in 2013.
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased shares.
The awards vest in full or in part depending on satisfaction of the performance conditions which are set out on pages 61 and 63 of the Remuneration Report.
The awards have a 3 year performance period and have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Senior Executive Share Scheme The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29th September 2006.
Sharesave Schemes The Sharesave Schemes is open to all employees and are exercised after either 3 or 5 years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the market price on the date preceding the date of invitation.
All Sharesave Schemes options have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment with the Group.
All options must be exercised within 6 months of the vesting date.
Fair value of awards Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is set out below: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price on Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance grant date Volatility yield Maturity interest rate one award pence period pence % % years % pence JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2013 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2014 7 April - 2014 - 19 1,045.00 19.10 - 1 - 5 1.73 1,045.00 2014 28 August - 2014 - 19 1,023.00 18.58 - 3 - 5 1.58 1,023.00 The option holders who have awards under the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option and Sharesave Schemes this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using internal and external models.
These models maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
During the year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2.
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
In respect of deferred and contingent consideration, unobservable inputs include managements assessment of the expected future performance of relevant acquired businesses.
A reconciliation of the movements in level 3 is provided below: Assets Liabilities Level 3 Level 3 '000 '000 At 1st January 2014 4,029 13,048 Exchange differences 161 230 Companies acquired 31 10,876 Utilised in the year - 4,198 Charged credited to income statement 133 573 At 31st December 2014 4,088 19,383 Of the 133,000 charged to the income statement, 121,000 is included in net finance costs and 12,000 in other operating costs.

Deferred income taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income taxes continued Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefits through the future taxable profits is considered probable.
A deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of 2,991,000 2013: 2,475,000 has not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of certain of the Group's operations, principally Singapore and Japan, where it is considered likely that the losses will expire before use.
A deferred tax asset relating to other deferred tax balances of 3,163,000 2013: 3,360,000 has not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of certain of the Group's overseas operations, principally the US, where it is considered that the asset is unlikely to be realised in the short term.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on temporary differences of 60 million 2013: 47 million representing the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.
Such amounts are permanently reinvested.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on temporary differences of nil 2013: nil representing unremitted earnings of associates.

Provision is made for the future rental cost of vacant property and expected dilapidation expenses.
In calculating the provision required, account is taken of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable from subletting.
Property provisions occur principally in the US and UK and relate to a variety of lease commitments.
The longest lease term expires in 2022.
Litigation provisions At any point in time the Group can be involved in a variety of litigation and dispute issues.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: UK US Canadian Irish US Stable At 31st December 2014 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Value Plan Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 2.50% n a 3.0% Rate of increase of pensions in payment a 3.11% n a 3.25% 3.00% n a Discount rate b 3.59% 3.80% 4.10% 2.30% 3.25-3.35% Inflation rate 2.78-3.21% 2.00% 2.25% 2.00% 2.00% Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 1.78% n a n a 2.00% n a Mortality - life expectancy at age 65 for male members: c Aged 65 at 31st December 22.0 22.1 19.7 21.7 22.1 UK US Canadian Irish US Stable At 31st December 2013 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Value Plan Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 3.00% n a n a Rate of increase of pensions in payment a 3.42% n a 3.50% 3.00% n a Discount rate b 4.60% 4.70% 4.80% 4.00% n a Inflation rate 3.25-3.52% 3.00% 2.25% 2.00% n a Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 2.25% n a n a 2.00% n a Mortality - life expectancy at age 65 for male members: c Aged 65 at 31st December 22.8 19.7 19.7 21.7 n a a In respect of the UK scheme, where there are inflation linked benefits, the inflation increases are limited to a maximum of 5% per annum some are limited to 3% per annum.
b In line with IAS 19 Revised the expected return on scheme assets assumption is the same as the discount rate assumed for the liabilities.
c Mortality assumptions for the UK scheme are based on 105% of the S2PxA tables, with improvements based on CMI 2013 tables with a 1.25% p. a. long-term rate of improvement.
Mortality assumptions for the US scheme and US Stable Value Plan are based on the RP2014 Mortality Table with MP2014 Projections.
Mortality assumptions for the Canadian scheme are based on the CPM-2014 Private Table with generational projection using scale CPM-B1D2014.
Mortality assumptions for the Irish scheme, in respect of both deferred pensioners and pensioners, assume that deaths after retirement will be in accordance with standard mortality tables 62% PNML00 for males and 70% PNFL00 for females with an increase to the annuity value of: - 0.50% male with no spouses pension - 0.38% female with no spouses pension - 0.39% male or female with spouses pension This is per annum compound for each year between 2008 and the year in which normal pension date falls.
Pre-retirement mortality has been assumed as nil.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Change to assumptions obligation Discount rate decrease of 0.1% increase of 2.0% Inflation rate increase of 0.1% increase of 2.0% Life expectancy increase of 1 year increase of 4.0% The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
Note this sensitivity is for defined benefit obligations only and does not consider the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the assets, in particular the assets held in respect of the insured pensioners.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.
