Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore, no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
The Group generated 61% 2013 restated : 62% of its investment income in the year from investments held in the UK and Ireland and 39% 2013 restated : 38% ofinvestment income from investments held in continental Europe.
During the year, the Group generated income from its investments in Elenia of23.2 million 2013 restated : 19.1 million, Eversholt of 17.9 million 2013 restated : 17.8 million, AWG of 15.6 million 2013 restated : 13.3 million and Oiltanking of 4.2 million 2013 restated : 4.3 million, which represents 33% 2013 restated : 31%, 25% 2013 restated : 29%, 22% 2013 restated : 21% and 6% 2013 restated : 7%, respectively of the total investment income.
There was no other income entitlement during the year or in the comparative year that represented more than 10% of portfolio income.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results ofthe Group during the year or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2014.

In previous years, and in line with the Companys policy, Ernst & Young LLP provided non-audit services to support the transaction activity conducted by the Group during the year in relation to certain investee companies.
The fees for these services are generally borne by the underlying investee companies or unconsolidated subsidiaries, and therefore are not included in the expenses of the Group.
TheCompanys policy for engaging the auditor for non-audit services is set out on page 60.

7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest Level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are Derivative financial instruments held at fair value observable in the market either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted investments and unlisted managed funds For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest Level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the beginning of each reporting period.
At 31 March 2014, the Group held the following classes of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
For all other assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates to fair value.
During the year ended 31 March 2014, there were no transfers of financial instruments between Levels ofthe fair value hierarchy 2013: none.
There were no non-recurring fair value measurements.

All unrealised movements on investments and foreign exchange movements are recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income during the year.
The holding period of the investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
For this reason, the Directors have classified the portfolio as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
Unquoted investments The Group invests in private companies which are not quoted in an active market.
These are measured in accordance with the International PrivateEquity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted investments can be found in the section called Portfolio valuation methodology.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets together where they will be managed and valued asa single investment, were invested at the same time and cannot be realised separately.
For the year to 31 March 2014, the fair value of unquoted investments was 980.4 million 2013 restated : 907.1 million.
Individual portfolio asset valuations are shown within the Portfolio summary onpage 20.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash flow basis, hence, the valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Other significant unobservable inputs include the long-term inflation rate assumption and interest rates assumption used to project the future cash flows.
A discussion of the range of discount rates applied can be found on page 24.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1%would reduce the value of the portfolio by 88.1 million 2013: 80.0 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 106.0 million 2013: 95.3 million.
The majority of assets held within Level 3 have revenues that are linked, partially linked or in some way correlated to inflation.
The long-term inflation rate assumptions range from 5.0% India to 2.0% Finland but with the majority at 2.5% UK.
Changing the inflation rate assumption may result in consequential changes to other assumptions used in the valuation of each asset.
The impact of increasing the inflation rate assumption by1% for the next two years would increase the value of the portfolio by 18.2 million 2013: 18.1 million.
Decreasing the inflation rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% for the next two years would decrease the value of the portfolio by 18.4 million 2013: 19.6 million.
The valuations are sensitive to changes to interest rates, which may result from: i unhedged existing borrowings within portfolio companies: ii interest rates on uncommitted future borrowings assumed within the asset valuations: and iii cash deposits held by portfolio companies.
These comprise a wide range of interest rates from short-term deposit rates to longer-term borrowing rates across a broad range of debt products.
Increasing the cost of borrowing assumption for unhedged borrowings and any future uncommitted borrowing and the cash deposit rates used inthe valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 44.8 million.
Decreasing the interest rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 43.1 million.
This calculation does not take account of any offsetting variances which may be expected to prevail if interest rates changed, the most significant impact would be in the portfolio assets with regulated returns where the future allowed return may also be influenced by the interest rate.
78 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financials and other information 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued Unlisted managed funds The Company invests in one externally managed fund, The Dalmore Capital Fund, which is not quoted in an active market.
The Company considered the valuation techniques and inputs used in valuing this fund as part of its due diligence prior to investing, to ensure they are reasonable and appropriate and therefore the net asset value NAV of this fund may be used as an input into measuring its fair value.
In measuring this fair value, the NAV of the fund is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect restrictions on redemptions, future commitments, illiquid nature of the investments and other specific factors of the fund and fund manager.
The Company classifies the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
Forthe year to 31 March 2014, the fair value of unlisted managed funds was 15.6 million 2013: 11.6 million.
There are no adjustments currently made to the NAV of the fund.
A 10% adjustment in the NAV of the fund would result in a 1.6 million 2013: 1.2 million change in the valuation.
Intermediate holding companies The Company invests in a number of intermediate holding companies that are used to hold the unquoted investments, valued as referred to above.
All other assets and liabilities of the intermediate holding companies are held either at fair value or a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The fair value of these intermediate holding companies therefore approximates to their NAV and the Company classifies the fair value as Level 3.
For the year to 31 March 2014, the fair value of these investments was 0.6 million 2013: 10.2 million.
Over-the-counter derivatives The Company holds its over-the-counter derivatives at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
This is discussed further in Note 10.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The valuation of unquoted investments, debt, managed fund and derivative investments is performed on a half-yearly basis by the valuation team of the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the Investment Committee of theInvestment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuation team.
The valuation team verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
On a half-yearly basis, the Investment Committee presents the valuation results to the Board of Directors.
This includes a discussion ofthe major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with significant fair valuechanges.
The Investment Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods are applied to support the valuation arising from the method chosen.
Any changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Companys Board of Directors.

9 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the risk section.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the risk section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs ought to be met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowings andshareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2014 79 Notes to the accounts 9 Financial risk management continued The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in utilities, transportation, primary PPP projects and renewable energy projects across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out intheGroups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time ofinvestment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA-rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The credit quality of loans and receivables and debt instruments within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed, or is expected tofail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the investment.
Fair value adjustments, orinvestment impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups investment.
In these cases an investment impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group had no investments subject to impairment 2013: nil.
No other assets held by the Group were considered tobeimpaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2013: nil.
3i Infrastructure plc actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review ofcounterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group did not consider itself to have exposure toone large counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed bydiversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.

1 Loans and borrowings relate to undrawn commitment fees payable on the Revolving Credit Facility referred to in Note 11.
All derivatives are settled net.
The financial commitment relates to the Companys commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, the National Military Museum and the Dalmore Capital Fund Note 16.
The cash flows from financial assets are not used to manage contractual liquidity risk.
80 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financials and other information 9 Financial risk management continued Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these fluctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2013: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase ordecrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 2.3 million 2013 restated : 4.4 million.
This exposure relates principally to changesininterest receivable on cash on deposit held at the year end.
The average cash balance of the Group during the year was 105.7 million 2013 restated : 155.5 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.4% 2013 restated : 0.5%.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations as disclosed in Note 7.
The Group does not hold any fixed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets areshown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
As at 31 March 2014 Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 673.9 365.4 74.5 1,113.8 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit 33.0 33.2 6.8 7.0 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 33.0 33.2 6.8 7.0 As at 31 March 2013 restated Sterling Euro US dollar Total m m m m Net assets 647.6 356.2 99.5 1,103.3 Sensitivity analysis Assuming a 10% appreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates: Impact of exchange movements on net profit 30.0 32.4 9.0 11.4 Impact of exchange movements on net assets 30.0 32.4 9.0 11.4 Comparative information, including relevant Notes, has been restated to reflect implementation of Investment Entities Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27.
The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit and net assets from that shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on market price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted investments, is provided in the Risk section.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.

3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2014 81 Notes to the accounts 9 Financial risk management continued The impact of a 10% decrease in the fair value of those investments would have the inverse impact on net profit and net assets, from that shownabove.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
However, the Directors have a set investment policy that establishes predefined limits for the exposure of the Group to an individual asset.
These limits have notbeen exceeded at 31 March 2014 or at 31 March 2013, and hence the Directors do not consider that any of these investments represent alargeexposure.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section and in Note 7.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to financial risks throughout the period to which they relate.

Forward foreign exchange contracts The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the effect of fluctuations in the investment portfolio from movements in exchange rates and also to fix the value of certain expected future cash flows arising from distributions made by investee companies.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
Thefair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
As at 31 March 2014, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Group was 330.0 million 2013: 317.0 million.
Fair value of derivatives The Company holds its over-the-counter derivatives at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheetdate.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and usespresent value calculations.
For these financial instruments, significant inputs into models are market observable and are included within Level2.
There have been no reclassifications for derivatives that have been transferred in or out of Level 2 or Level 3 during the year 2013: nil.
11 Loans and borrowings On 2 May 2013, the Company signed a new, three-year, unsecured 200 million revolving credit facility at a fixed margin above LIBOR.
This replaced the existing facility which was due to expire in November 2013.
The facility has standard loan covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio and loan to value ratio.
There is an annual agency fee of 15,000 associated with the facility.
As at 31 March 2014, the Company had not drawn down against this facility 2013: nil.
