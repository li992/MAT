Combined with lower oil prices this has led to the estimated recoverable amount of the CNV producing asset being less than the book carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the CNV producing asset has been determined using the fair value less costs of disposal method which constitutes a level 3 valuation within the fair value hierarchy.
The majority of the fair value is derived from a discounted cash flow valuation of the 2P production profile, with a minor portion derived from the incremental value of 2C contingent resources, significantly risk adjusted.
The key assumptions to which the fair value measurement is most sensitive are oil price, reserves and the risked value ascribed to contingent resources.
Consequently a pre-tax impairment charge in the amount of $60.5 million has been reflected in the income statement in accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in Note 2 h. The associated tax credit of $22.3 million is reflected in Note 19.
As at 31 December 2014, the fair value of the asset is estimated at $104.4 million based on a discount rate of 10% and an oil price reflecting the current three-year forward curve and $90 per barrel plus inflation of 2.5% thereafter.
Other fixed assets comprise plant and machinery, computer equipment and fixtures and fittings.
