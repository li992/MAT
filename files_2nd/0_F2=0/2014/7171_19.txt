In performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows of income-generating units.
These assumptions are set out in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension accounting Under IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits, the Group has recognised a pension deficit of 43.9 million 2013: 33.0 million.
A number of assumptions have been made in determining the pension deficit and these are described in note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables As described in note 17, provisions for impairment of trade receivables have been made.
In reviewing the appropriateness of these provisions, consideration has been given to the ageing of the debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into account current economic conditions.
4SegmentAL informAtion ifrS 8 operating Segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports, rather than use turnover.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 82.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 5.

Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows: Assumption How determined operating profit The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by the Groups Management Board which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates andexpected cash conversion rates.
discount rates The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 13.0% 2013: 12.5% reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC adjusted for the risk-free rate for 10-year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and where appropriate, the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the increased return required over and above a risk-free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
growth rates The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources ofan average estimated growth rate of 2.0% 2013: 2.0%, reflecting a combination of GDP expectations and long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
GDP growth is a key driver of our business, and is therefore a key consideration in developing long-term forecasts.
Wage inflation is also an important driver of net fees as net fees are derived directly from the salary level of candidates placed into employment.
Based on past experience a combination of these two factors is considered to be an appropriate basis for assessing long-term growth rates.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in the long-term growth rate from year 2 onwards between 0% and 2% in absolute terms.
The sensitivity analysis shows no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: In s million 2014 2013 Asia Pacific 18.8 21.5 Continental Europe & Rest of World 58.7 62.7 United Kingdom & Ireland 93.1 93.1 170.6 177.3 Strategic report governance financial Statements Shareholder information 94HAYS PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2014 95 14otHer intAngibLe ASSetS In s million 2014 2013 Cost At 1 July 87.7 86.2 Exchange adjustments 1.4 0.2 Additions 6.1 1.4 Disposals 1.2 0.1 At 30 June 91.2 87.7 Amortisation At 1 July 43.3 30.7 Exchange adjustments 0.8 0.1 Charge for the year 12.9 12.6 Disposals 0.7 0.1 At 30 June 54.7 43.3 net book value At 30 June 36.5 44.4 At 1 July 44.4 55.5 All other intangible assets relate to computer software.

At 30 June 2014 the Group had drawn down 110 million 2013: 145 million from its unsecured revolving credit facility.
In 2011 the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge this risk.
The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June 2014 was 0.1 million 2013: 0.5 million.

Committed facilities The Group has a 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in October 2017.
The financial covenants require the Groups interest cover ratio to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.85% to 2.40%.
At 30 June 2014, 190 million of the committed facility was undrawn.

Capital management The Boards priorities for free cash flow are to fund the Groups investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level that is affordable and appropriate.
The Board targets a dividend cover range of 2.0x to 3.0x, and remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend.
Further details can be found in the Financial Review on page 27.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents note 18, bank loans and overdrafts note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
foreign currency risk The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2014.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposure.
The Groups operating profit exposure to foreign currency translation is primarily in respect of the Euro and the Australian Dollar.

The Groups principal schemes are operated within the UK where the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
uk defined contribution scheme The Groups principal defined contribution retirement benefit scheme is the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan which is operated for all qualifying employees and is funded via an employee salary sacrifice arrangement, and for qualifying employees additional employer contributions.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 5.9 million 2013: 5.1 million represents employers contributions payable to the money purchase arrangements.
Contributions of 0.5 million 2013: 0.4 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
uk defined benefit schemes The Groups principal defined benefit schemes are the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Scheme, both in the UK.
The Hays Pension Scheme is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme providing pensions and death benefits to members.
The Hays Supplementary Scheme is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The Schemes were closed to future accrual from 30 June 2012 with pensions calculated up until the point of closure.
The Schemes are governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Group, and are subject to full actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2012, and quantified the deficit at c. 150 million.
A revised deficit funding schedule was agreed with effect from 1 July 2012 which maintained the annual contribution at 12.8 million, subject to a 3% per annum fixed uplift over a period of just under 10 years.
During the year the Group made a contribution of 13.1 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2013: 12.8 million in accordance with the deficit funding schedule.
The cash contributions during the year mainly related to deficit funding payments.
The Schemes have continued with an investment strategy of targeting to hold 40% of assets in growth portfolio with a target return of 2.9% over gilts and 60% invested in defensive portfolio targeting 0.7% return over gilts.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks.

The key assumptions used at 30June 2014 are listed below.
2014 2013 Discount rate 4.4% 4.8% RPI inflation 3.4% 3.4% CPI inflation 2.4% 2.4% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.3% 3.4% Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.4% 2.4% The discount rate has been constructed as a gilt yield of 3.5% per annum 2013: 3.7% plus a credit spread on high-quality debt instruments of0.9% per annum 2013: 1.1%.
The gilt yield of 3.5% is the flat yield equivalent to valuing the liabilities of the gilt curve published by the Bank of England.
The RPI inflation assumption is equivalent to valuing the liabilities on the government debt implied inflation curve published by the Bank of England.
The life expectancy assumptions have been calculated using Club vita base tables and future improvements in line with the CMI 2011 model with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum and non peaked short-term future improvements.
On this basis a 65-year-old current pensioner has a life expectancy of 24 years and 26 years for males and females respectively.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities at the year end is: Change in Impact on assumption Schemes Discount rate 0.5% 72m RPI inflation 0.5% 45m Assumed life expectancy at age 60 rate of mortality 1 year 18m The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation to one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
