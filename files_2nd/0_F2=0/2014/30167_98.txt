Share-based payments continued Share option schemes TSB Sharesave Eligible employees can choose to enter into a contract to save up to 500 per month and, at the maturity date, three years from the start of the savings contract, have the option to use these savings within six months to acquire shares in the Group at a 20% discount to the market price on the date of the Sharesave invitation.
Movements in the number of TSB Sharesave options outstanding are set out below: Weighted Average Number of exercise options price 000s pence Outstanding at 1 January 2014 Granted 6,585 225.48 Exercised Forfeited 70 225.48 Cancelled 214 225.48 Outstanding at 31 December 2014 6,301 225.48 Exercisable at 31 December 2014 The remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2014 was two years and nine months.
The fair value of options granted in 2014, determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, was 92 pence per option.
The significant inputs into the model are shown below: Share price at date of Sharesave invitation 281.85p Exercise price 225.48p Volatility 30% Interest free rate 1.5% Dividend yield 0% Ordinarily volatility would be determined by reference to the historical share price over the most recent three year period, being the period commensurate with the option term.
However, as a newly listed entity, the Group did not have a relevant trading history at the date of the grant of the above share options.
Therefore, volatility was determined by comparing the TSB share price volatility in the period from the Groups listing on 25 June 2014 to 30 September 2014 with a comparator group comprising UK listed banks and FTSE 250 financial companies and extrapolating the Groups relative share price volatility in this period against the comparator groups historic volatility over the most recent three year historical period leading up to the grant date of the TSB Sharesave options.
Share Awards Free shares On 25 June 2014, the Group made an award of 100 of free shares to each TSB Partner.
The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the Partners behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.
The award is subject to a non-market based condition whereby if a TSB Partner leaves the Group within the three year holding period for other than good leaver reasons such as retirement or redundancy all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.
Share incentive plan SIP matching shares In October 2014, the Group commenced a SIP, Sharematch.
The Group undertakes to match shares purchased by Partners, upto the value of 30 per month, which are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the TSB Partners behalf.
Duringthis period the TSB Partner is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.
As with free shares, if a TSB Partner leaves the Group within the three year holding period under anything other than good leaver status, all of the matching shares are forfeited.
Similarly, if TSB Partners sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.
