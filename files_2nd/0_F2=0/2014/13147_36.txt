Historically, the largest schemes have been local versions of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest dened benefit schemes are in the UK, the US and theNetherlands.
The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
The Netherlands scheme is a career average salary scheme and remains open to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their current salary at a rate calculated to enable them to reach a pension level based on their average salary.
Each of the major dened benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees of the pension funds in the UK and the Netherlands and plan duciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneciaries.
In the UK and in the Netherlands the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The boards of trustees consist of an equal number of company appointed and member nominated Directors.
In the US, the duciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pensions Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectied with additional contributions over a seven year period.
In the Netherlands, on a regulatory basis, with effect from 1 January 2015, the scheme funding level is determined by the new Financial Assessment Framework nFTK.
The nFTK introduces, inter alia, a 12 month average funding ratio, higher buffer requirements and stricter indexation than under previous legislation, and a 10 year recovery plan in the event of funding shortfalls.
In case of a shortfall in the funding level, the first recovery plans are required to be led with the Dutch Central Bank on 1 July 2015.
On a contractual basis, the employer contribution is capped at 11.9% of salary.
Total regular employer contributions to dened benefit pension schemes in respect of 2015 are expected to be approximately 65m.
