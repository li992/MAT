Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.
IFRSs that are mandatory for application as of 31 December 2014, but not adopted by theEuropean Union, do not have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, available-for-sale investments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Groups activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by theuncertainty and instability of the current economic environment Note 30.
In response the Group implemented a number of cost cutting initiatives, reduced capital expenditures and continues to reduce the level of debt.
Based on the currently available facts and circumstances the directors and management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Restatement of Financial Statements Subsidiaries that Ceased to Be Classified as Held for Sale During the year the Group revised its plan to dispose of all of its investment in EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited, which was classified as a disposal group held for sale as at 31December 2012 and 2013.
On 12 August 2014 the Group signed an agreement to sell a 34% shareholding at 31 December 2014 the transaction continues to be pending as certain conditions of the sale have not been met and to retain control over the remaining 51.1% ownership interest.
However, management expects to recover the investment in EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited principally through sale.
At the end of 2014, the sale of the subsidiary within one year was not considered to be highly probable.
At 31December 2013, the disposal groups held for sale relating to the other segment included an office building in Moscow.
In the 2nd half of 2014, due to the current market conditions management decided not to sell this asset.
As a result of these changes in circumstances, EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited and the subsidiary owning the office building ceased to meet the definition of a disposal group held for sale.
In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations the Group restated its consolidated financial statements, including the relevant notes, for the periods in which the assets were classified as held for sale as if the subsidiaries had not been classified as assets held for sale in the past and all assets and liabilities and the results of operations had been accounted for in accordance with the applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in theprevious year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2014.
New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2014: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IFRS 10 replaced the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements.
It also addresses the issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities.
The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled and therefore are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28.
These disclosures relate to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
A number of new disclosures are also required and have been disclosed by the Group in Note 32, but they have no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 These amendments provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity under IFRS 10.
The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IFRS 11 replaced IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers.
IFRS 11 removed the option to account for jointly controlled entities JCEs using proportionate consolidation.
Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of a joint venture must be accounted for using the equity method.
As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 28 Investments in Associates, has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates.
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities These amendments clarify the meaning of currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-financial Assets These amendments remove the unintended consequences of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement on the disclosures required under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
In addition, these amendments require disclosure of the recoverable amounts for the assets or cash-generating units CGUs for which an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed during the period.
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria.
I FRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 is applicable to all levies imposed by governments under legislation, other than outflows that are within the scope of other standards e. g. IAS 12 Income Taxes and fines or other penalties for breaches of legislation.
The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy no earlier than when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs.
It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation.
For alevy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, no liability is recognised before the specified minimum threshold is reached.
The Group early adopted IFRIC 21 in the European Union it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 17 June 2014.
The new standards, interpretations and amendments described above did not have a significant impact on thefinancial position or performance of the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: The Group determined that it obtained control over Corber on 16January 2013 Note11.
As of 31 December 2012, certain conditions relating to acquisition of an additional 50% ownership interest in Corber were not met.
As such, the Group did not consolidate Corber in 2012.
The Group determined that the 51% ownership interest in Timir Note 11 does not provide control over the entity.
In April 2013, the Group concluded a joint venture agreement with Alrosa under which major operating and financial decisions are made by unanimous consent of the Group and Alrosa, it ensures that no single venturer is in aposition to control the activity unilaterally.
Consequently, the Group determined that Timir constitutes a joint venture under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Estimation Uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets.
In 2014, 2013 and 2012, theGroup recognised an impairment loss of $192million, $307million and $404million, respectively Note 9.
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing and amount of the impairment.
Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists.
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management.
Methods used to determine the value in use include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These estimates, including the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the value in use and, ultimately, the amount of any impairment.
Useful Lives of Items of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment at least at each financial year end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
These estimates may have a material impact on the amount of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and on depreciation expense for the period.
On 1 January 2014, the Group changed its estimation of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which resulted in a $52million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in estimate occurred.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 131 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations The Group is required to recognise separately, at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed in a business combination at their fair values, which involves estimates.
Such estimates are based on valuation techniques which require considerable judgement in forecasting future cash flows and developing other assumptions.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which thegoodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Thecarrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1,541million, $1,988million and $2,203million, respectively.
In 2014, 2013 and 2012, theGroup recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in theamount of $330million, $168million and $Nil, respectively.
More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are provided in Note 5.
Mineral Reserves Mineral reserves and the associated mine plans are a material factor in the Groups computation of a depletion charge.
The Group estimates its mineral reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves JORC Code.
Estimation of reserves in accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires use of subjective judgement and development of assumptions.
Mine plans are periodically updated which can have a material impact on the depletion charge for the period.
Site Restoration Provisions The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period based on the requirements of the current legislation of thecountry where the respective operating assets are located.
Thecarrying amount of a provision is the present value of the expected expenditures, i. e. cash outflows discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching thebest estimate of a provision.
Considerable judgement is required in forecasting future site restoration costs.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in theamount of a provision when there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur.
Post-Employment Benefits The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related current service cost.
This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees who are eligible for benefits mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.
as well as financial assumptions discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.. More details are provided in Note 23.
Allowances The Group makes allowances for doubtful receivables to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the current overall economic conditions, the ageing of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and changes in payment terms.
Changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to theallowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
Asof 31 December 2014, 2013 and 2012, allowances for doubtful accounts in respect of trade and other receivables have been made in theamount of $57million, $60million and $101million, respectively Note 28.
The Group makes an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials and spare parts.
Inaddition, certain finished goods of the Group are carried at net realisable value Note 14.
Estimates of net realisable value of finished goods are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made.
These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring subsequent to the end of the reporting period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.
Deferred Income Tax Assets Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected performance.
Various factors are considered to assess the probability of thefuture utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies.
Ifactual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, thefinancial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.
Inthe event that the assessment of future utilisation of deferred tax assets must be reduced, this reduction will be recognised in the statement of operations.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in USdollars is convenient for the major current and potential users of the consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are theRussian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia.
As at thereporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions.
Theexchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a subsidiary with functional currency other than the US dollar, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at theend of the reporting period.
All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights, or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations, are consolidated.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with thepolicies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
Non-controlling interests are presented in theconsolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from theparents shareholders equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of Subsidiaries Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of theacquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 133 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation continued Acquisition of Subsidiaries continued The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination.
If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for thecombination using those provisional values.
The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.
Increases in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for such increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in theconsolidated financial statements.
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost of the controlling entity thePredecessor.
Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessors original acquisition is also recorded in the financial statements.
Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessors goodwill, and the consideration paid is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if asubsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was originally acquired by thePredecessor.
Put Options over Non-controlling Interests The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings.
The difference between the amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of thederecognised non-controlling interests is charged to accumulated profits.
Investments in Associates Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of thevoting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate and goodwill impairment charges, if any.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in equity.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, theassociate.
If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to theextent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in Joint Ventures The Groups interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly ventures is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of joint ventures.
The statement of operations reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
Property, Plant and Equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that cost is incurred and recognition criteria are met.
The Groups property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs and capitalised site restoration costs.
Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Mine development and construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
134 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Business Units Review Governance Financial Statements 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment continued At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment.
If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment loss in thestatement of operations or other comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end.
Thetable below presents the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Weighted average Useful lives remaining useful years life years Buildings and constructions 1560 22 Machinery and equipment 445 11 Transport and motor vehicles 720 7 Other assets 315 7 The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and probable mineral reserves.
The depletion calculation takes into account future development costs for reserves which are in the production phase.
Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.
Major renewals and improvements are capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised.
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried at their recoverable amount of zero.
Thecosts to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures represent costs incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable.
The expenditures include acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting mineral resources.
These costs are expensed as incurred.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the Group commences recognition of expenditures related to the development of mineral resources as assets.
These assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on thesubstance of the arrangement at inception date as to whether the fulfilment of thearrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised from the commencement of thelease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of theminimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on theremaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of thelease term or its useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of theasset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as anexpense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associate and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investments in associates.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 135 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Goodwill continued After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at least at each year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level.
Thetable below presents the useful lives of intangible assets.
Weighted average Useful lives remaining useful years life years Customer relationships 115 11 Contract terms 10 9 Other 519 9 Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will continue indefinitely.
The most part of the Groups intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations Note 10.
Financial Assets The Group classified its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity, and available-for-sale.
When investments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its investments after initial recognition.
Investments that are acquired principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price are classified as held for trading and included in the category financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments which are included in this category are subsequently carried at fair value: gains or losses on such investments are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
136 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Business Units Review Governance Financial Statements 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Assets continued Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, are classified as available-for-sale: these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are included in current assets.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations.
Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in thestatement of operations.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the end of the reporting period.
For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Such techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other generally accepted valuation techniques.
All purchases and sales of financial assets under contracts to purchase or sell financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are recognised on the settlement date i. e. the date the asset is delivered by to the counterparty.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which generally are short-term, are recognised and carried at theoriginal invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable that represents its estimate of incurred losses.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar receivables in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
Thecost of finished goods and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Value Added Tax The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax VAT on a net basis.
The Groups subsidiaries apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and delivery of goods or rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers.
VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end of the reporting period, is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over theperiod of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised Note 9.
Financial Guarantee Liabilities Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period and the amount initially recognised.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 137 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Equity Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity from the proceeds.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Shares Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in statement of operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before the end of the reporting period.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Employee Benefits Social and Pension Contributions Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance, medical insurance and unemployment funds at the statutory rates in force based on gross salary payments.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in respect of those benefits.
Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due.
These contributions are expensed as incurred.
Defined Benefit Plans The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees Note 23.
Theentitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum service period.
Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age.
Other employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits.
The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective bargaining agreements and or in the plan documents.
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises  costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
It is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Group recognises current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements in the consolidated statement of operations within cost of sales, general and administrative expenses and selling and distribution expenses.
Other Costs The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services.
These amounts principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales.
Share-based Payments The Group has management compensation schemes Note 21, under which certain senior executives and employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments equitysettled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with grantees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any conditions, other than market conditions.
138 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Business Units Review Governance Financial Statements 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Share-based Payments continued The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity additional paid-in capital, over the period in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The charge or credit in the statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Once a share-settled transaction is vested, no further accounting entries are made to reverse the cost already charged, even if the instruments that are the subject of the transaction are subsequently forfeited.
In this case, the Group makes a transfer between different components of equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Cash-settled share-based payments represent transactions in which the Group acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to thesupplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price or value of the Groups shares or other equity instruments.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
This fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of operations.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in thecomputation of earnings per share Note 20.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
When goods are sold or services are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, adjusted by theamount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred.
When the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of Goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Themoment of transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is determined by thecontract terms.
Rendering of Services The Groups revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services.
Revenue is recognised when services are rendered.
Interest Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends Revenue is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
Rental Income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current Income Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the statement of operations.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 139 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred Income Tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Segment Information For management purposes, in 2013 and previous periods the Group was organised into business units based on their products and services, and had four reportable operating segments: Steel production segment included production of steel and related products at eleven steel mills.
Mining segment included iron ore and coal mining and enrichment.
Vanadium products segment included extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products.
Vanadium slag arising in the steel-making process was also allocated to the vanadium segment.
Other operations included energy-generating companies, seaports, shipping and railway transportation companies.
In 2014, the management reporting used by the chief operating decision maker for making decisions about resource allocation has changed to put more emphasis on analysis of the operating results of the coal segment and operations in North America.
As such, new reportable segments were identified and the comparative segment information has been restated accordingly.
The new reportable operating segments are: Steel segment includes production of steel and related products at all mills except for those located in North America.
Extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products, iron ore mining and enrichment and certain energy-generating companies are also included in this segment as they are closely related to the main process of steel production.
Steel, North America is a segment, which includes production of steel and related products in the USA and Canada.
Coal segment includes coal mining and enrichment.
It also includes operations of Nakhodka Trade Sea Port as it is used to a significant extent for shipping of products of the coal segment to the Asian markets.
Other operations include energy-generating companies, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
Operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments if they show a similar long-term economic performance, have comparable production processes, customer industries and distribution channels, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are generally managed and monitored together.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA.
This performance indicator is calculated based on management accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for thefollowing reasons: 1 for the last month of the reporting period, the management accounts for each operating segment are prepared using a forecast for that month: 2 the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation expense which is adjusted to approximate the amount under IFRS.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Groups statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of the Groups revenue that can be allocated to it on a reasonable basis, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions with other segments.
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant portion of an expense that can be allocated to it on areasonable basis, including expenses relating to external counterparties and expenses relating to transactions with other segments.
Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segments profit loss from operations adjusted for impairment of assets, profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains losses and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.

As a result, Corber became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group on 16 January 2013.
Management believes that this acquisition will increase the Groups coking coal self-coverage and generate substantial operational synergies to the Group, including theoptimal use of various coal grades.
The purchase consideration included 132,653,006 shares of EVRAZ plc issued on 16January 2013, warrants to subscribe for an additional 33,944,928 EVRAZ plc shares exercisable at zero price in the period from 17 January to 17 April 2014 and a cash consideration of $202million to be paid in equal quarterly instalments to 15 January 2014.
Fair value of the consideration transferred totalled to $964million, including $611million relating to the shares issued, $156million representing the fair value of the warrants and $197million being the present value of the cash component of the purchase consideration.
The fair value of shares and warrants was determined by reference to the market value of EVRAZ plc shares at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer shall remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss in the income statement.
The fair value of the equity interest previously held by an acquirer is further added to the purchase consideration in the purchase price calculation.
The fair value of the equity interest previously held by the Group was $658million.
The fair value of the investment in Corber was determined using the market price of shares of Raspadskaya at the date of acquisition of an additional 50% share in Corber.

In addition, the Group made a write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment and recorded an impairment relating to VAT with a long-term recovery.
For the purpose of the impairment testing as of 31 December 2014 the Group assessed therecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on calculation of either value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell.
Both valuation techniques used cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units.
For the periods not covered by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the results of the respective business plans using a zero real growth rate.
Indetermination of fair value less costs to sell the assets value additionally includes the cashflows of future projects not started yet and the associated capital expenditure costs.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the changes in expectations of long-term prices for iron ore and steel products, the increase in forecasted costs, changes in forecasted production volumes and the increase in the discount rates.

Average price of Period of Pre-tax commodity forecast, discount per tonne years rate, % Commodity in 2015 EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works 5 27.14 steel products $471 EVRAZ Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant 5 15.96 steel products $491 EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant 5 16.83 steel products $409 steel mill under EVRAZ Caspian Steel 5 13.65 construction $490 steel mill under EVRAZ Yuzhny Stan 5 14.44 construction EVRAZ Bagleykoks 5 18.34 coke $168 ferrovanadium EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. 5 13.98 products $33,741 Yuzhkuzbassugol 15 17.98 coal $67 Raspadskaya 20 16.10 coal $47 undeveloped Mezhegeyugol 27 18.36 coal field $95 EVRAZ Kachkanarsky  Integrated Works 25 17.08 ore $45 EVRAZ Sukha Balka 19 24.08 ore $43 Evrazruda 20 17.87 ore $60 The value in use of the cash-generating units for which an impairment loss was recognised or reversed in the reporting year was as follows at 31 December.
US$million 2014 2013 Oregon Steel Portland Mill $579 $788 Calgary 243 433 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 54 220 As management expects to recover investments in EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited principally through sale, the recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit was measured at $107million as fair value less costs of disposal, which was determined based on the share prices of the subsidiary Level1 at 31 December 2014.
The calculations of value in use are most sensitive to the following assumptions: Discount Rates Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit.
The discount rates have been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers.
Reasonably possible changes in discount rates could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli, EVRAZInc.
NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an additional impairment of $147million.
EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 151 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 6.
Impairment of Assets continued Sales Prices The prices of the products sold by the Group were estimated using industry research.
TheGroup expects that the nominal prices will fluctuate with a compound annual growth rate of 3.3 %-2.9% in 2015 2019, 2.5%-3.0% in 2020 and thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales prices could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli, EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZInc.
If the prices assumed for 2015 and 2016 in the impairment test were 10% lower, this would lead to an additional impairment of $156million.
Sales Volumes Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products would increase by 1% in 2015 and would grow evenly during the following four years to reach normal asset capacity utilisation thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli EVRAZInc.
If the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2015 and 2016 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $15million.
Cost Control Measures The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management.
A reasonably possible deviation of cost from these plans could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works, EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli, EVRAZInc.
If the actual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for 2015 and 2016 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $175million.
The units recoverable amount would become equal to its carrying amount if the assumptions used to measure the recoverable amount changed by the following percentages: Discount Sales Sales Cost control rates prices volumes measures EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. 8.7% 8.4 % 2.1% EVRAZ Sukha Balka 8.2% EVRAZ Dnepropetrovsk Iron and Steel Works 6.9% EVRAZ Inc.

Compliance with Financial Covenants Some of the loan agreements and terms and conditions of notes provide for certain covenants in respect of EVRAZ plc and its subsidiaries.
The covenants impose restrictions in respect of certain transactions and financial ratios, including restrictions in respect of indebtedness and profitability.
$500million pre-export credit facility received in 2014 from a syndicate of banks is subject to certain financial maintenance covenants.
These covenants require EVRAZ plc to maintain two key ratios, consolidated net indebtedness to 12-month consolidated EBITDA and 12-month consolidated EBITDA to adjusted 12-month consolidated interest expense, within certain limits.
Also the covenants contain a limitation on the amount of EVRAZ plc total consolidated indebtedness.
A breach of one or both of these ratios or excess of the indebtedness limit would constitute an event of default under the facility which in turn may trigger cross default events under other debt instruments of the Group.
The facility terms also set certain limitations on dividend payments by EVRAZ plc, acquisitions and disposals.
Notes due in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 totalling $3,098million issued by Evraz Group S. A. a holding company directly wholly owned by EVRAZ plc, have covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries conditional on a gross leverage ratio.
While the ratio level itself does not constitute a breach of covenants, exceeding the threshold triggers a restriction on incurrence of consolidated indebtedness, which is removed once the ratio goes back below the threshold.
The effect of the restriction is such that Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries are not allowed to increase the consolidated indebtedness at the level of Evraz Group S. A. but are allowed to refinance existing indebtedness subject to certain conditions.
The $400million notes due 2017 issued by Raspadskaya in 2012 have covenants similar to those of Evraz Group S. A. but with the ratio calculation based on the consolidated numbers of OAORaspadskaya and the restrictions applying only to OAO Raspadskaya and its subsidiaries.
These restrictions have the same effect on Raspadskaya, but no effect on EVRAZ plc and its other subsidiaries that are not part of the Raspadskaya Group.
The $350million notes due 2019 issued by EVRAZ Inc NA Canada in November 2014 have certain covenants, that contain restrictions on the incurrence of new debt by EVRAZ North America plc, the parent company of EVRAZ Inc NA and EVRAZ Inc NA Canada, and its subsidiaries together, EVRAZ North America and restrictions on the certain type of payments, including dividends, from EVRAZ North America.

Loans and Borrowings continued OOO UK Mezhegeyugol, which is a direct subsidiary of EVRAZ plc, is not subject to restrictions imposed by the above mentioned covenants.
However, as a borrower of a $195million project loan by Gazprombank, it is restricted from incurring any additional indebtedness without the consent of the lender.
The incurrence covenants are in line with the Groups financial strategy and, therefore, do not constitute any excessive restriction on its operations.
In addition to the incurrence covenants mentioned above, at 31 December 2014 the Group had loans with an aggregate principal amount of $341 million, which are subject to financial maintenance covenants.
Under $251 million out of this amount the covenants require Evraz Group S. A. to maintain two key ratios, consolidated net indebtedness to 12-month consolidated EBITDA and 12-month consolidated EBITDA to adjusted 12-month consolidated interest expense, within certain limits, under the remaining $90 million only the first ratio is applicable.
A breach of one or both of the ratios would constitute an event of default under the above mentioned facility agreements, which in its turn may trigger cross default events under other debt instruments of Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries.
During 2014 the Group was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants.
Unamortised Debt Issue Costs Unamortised debt issue costs represent agent commission and transaction costs paid by theGroup in relation to the arrangement and reset of loans and notes.
Unutilised Borrowing Facilities The Group had the following unutilised borrowing facilities as of 31 December: US$million 2014 2013 2012 Committed $439 $437 $421 Uncommitted 1,225 811 725 Total unutilised borrowing facilities $1,664 $1,248 $1,146 23.
Employee Benefits Russian Plans Certain Russian subsidiaries of the Group provide regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at retirement date.
These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective bargaining agreements.
Other post-employment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits.
The Group funds thebenefits when theamounts of benefits fall due for payment.
In addition, some subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to aseparately administered non-state pension fund.
The Group matches 100% of the employees contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary.
TheGroups contributions become payable at the participants retirement dates.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance and medical insurance funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments.
Ukrainian Plans The Ukrainian subsidiaries make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby compensating preferential pensions paid by the fund to employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions.
The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary.
In 2011 and before, these preferential pensions were partially funded by the State Pension Fund.
TheUkrainian subsidiaries gradually increased these contributions and starting from 2012 they pay 100% of preferential pensions.
In addition, employees receive lump-sum payments on retirement and other benefits under collective labour agreements.
These benefits are based on years of service and level of compensation.
All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans.
In 2013, the amended pension legislation introduced annual indexation of pensions, at least up to the level of CPI.
The indexation of pensions in a particular year depends on the availability of financial resources in the State pension fund.
The subsidiaries are obliged to pay preferential pensions indexed according to the governments decision.
The Group determined the amount of defined benefit obligations based on the assumption that pensions will be indexed despite possible insufficiency of money in the State pension fund, which would result in a nonfulfilment of this law by the fund itself and, consequently, would cancel the obligations of Ukrainian enterprises to pay higher pensions.
US and Canadian Plans The Groups subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans that cover specified eligible employees.
Benefits are based on pensionable years of service, pensionable compensation, or a combination of both depending on theindividual plan.
Certain employees that were hired after specified dates are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans.
Those employees are instead enrolled in defined contribution plans and receive a contribution funded by the Groups subsidiaries equal to 27% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses.
The defined contribution plans are funded annually, and participants benefits vest after three years of service.
Thesubsidiaries also offer qualified Thrift 401 k plans to all of their eligible employees.

Employee Benefits continued Other Plans Defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans are maintained by thesubsidiaries located in South Africa, Italy and the Czech Republic.
Defined Contribution Plans The Groups expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows: US$million 2014 2013 2012 Expense under defined contribution plans $398 $488 $412 Defined Benefit Plans The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and theUS and Canadian plans are partially funded.
In 2014, there were no significant plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements.
The Groups defined benefit plans are exposed to the risks of unexpected growth in benefit payments as a result of increases in life expectancy, inflation, and salaries.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted and unquoted equity shares, corporate and government bonds and notes, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk.

Theexchange is exercised on approximately the same dates as thepayments under thebonds.

TheGroup accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was determined using valuation techniques.
The fair value was calculated as the present value of the expected cashflows under the contracts at the reporting dates.
Future roubledenominated cashflows were translated into US dollars using the USD RUB implied yield forward curve.
The discount rates used in the valuation were the non-deliverable forward rate curve and the interest rate swap curve for US dollar at the reporting dates.
In2014, 2013 and 2012, the change in fair value of the derivatives of $ 494 million, $ 106 million and $96million, respectively, together with a realised gain loss on the swap transactions, amounting to $ 94 million, $51million and $81million, respectively, was recognised within gain loss on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations Note 7.
In 2014 and 2013, upon repayment of the 13.5% and 9.25% bonds, the related swap contracts matured.
Contingent Consideration Payable Contingent consideration represents additional payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in2006.
This consideration could be paid each year up to 2019.
The payments depend on thedeviation of the average prices for vanadium pentoxide from certain levels and the amounts payable for each year are limited to maximum amounts.
In 20142012, theGroup was not required to pay this consideration due to the movements in the vanadium pentoxide market relative to the levels set in the agreement.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable.
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in USdollars, in reputable international banks and major Russian banks.
Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
In 2014, themajor customers were Russian Railways and Enbridge Inc. 3.6%and 4.4% of total sales, respectively.
Part of the Groups sales is made on terms of letter of credit.
Inaddition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer applies for credit terms which are longer than normal.
In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other collateral.
The Group has developed standard credit terms and constantly monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers.
Certain of the Groups long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises and governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties.
The significant part of doubtful debts allowance consists of receivables from such customers.
The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.
At 31 December the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets, which is disclosed below.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise.
The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments.
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs.
If necessary, the Group refinances its short-term debt by long-term borrowings.
The Group also uses forecasts to monitor potential and actual financial covenants compliance issues Note 22.
Where compliance is at risk, the Group considers options including debt repayment, refinancing or covenant reset.
TheGroup has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors.

Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest Rate Risk The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and other obligations.
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates.
The Groups treasury function performs analysis of current interest rates.
In case of changes inmarket fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms.
The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups equity.

The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily USdollars, Canadian dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Groups operations.
However, management believes that the Group is partly secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk continued Currency Risk continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts receivable and payable, short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.
At 31 December the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2014 2013 2012 US$million Level 1Level 2Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets Note 13 17 30 21 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 2 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Note 25 713 219 115 Deferred consideration payable for theacquisition of Inprom Note25 10 Contingent consideration payable for theacquisition of Stratcor Note25 2 8 12 During the reporting period, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
The following table shows financial instruments for which carrying amounts differ from fair values at 31December.
The fair value of long-term bank loans was calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at theGroups market rates of interest at the reporting dates Level 3.
The discount rates used for valuation of financial instruments were as follows: Currency in which financial instruments are denominated 2014 2013 2012 USD 8.9 14.7% 4.5 8.2% 7.5 8.6% EUR 1.9% 2.7% 2.9% RUB 10.4% 9.2% EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 187 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 December 2014 28.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Capital Management Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity.
Revaluation surplus which is included in capital is not subject to capital management because of its nature.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise the return to shareholders.
The Board of Directors reviews the Groups performance and establishes key performance indicators.
There were no changes in the objectives, policies and processes during 2014.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it by the issue of new shares, dividend payments to shareholders, and the purchase of treasury shares.
Inaddition, theGroup monitors distributable profits on a regular basis and determines theamounts and timing of dividend payments.
The capital requirements imposed by certain loan agreements included a $2,000million minimum representing consolidated equity of Evraz Group S. A. less goodwill.
In 20122013, the Group was in compliance with this requirement.
In June 2013, this covenant was abolished.
Non-cash Transactions Transactions that did not require the use of cash or cash equivalents were as follows in theyears ended 31 December: US$million 2014 2013 2012 Liabilities for purchases of property, plant and equipment $45 $148 $144 Loan issued to a partner of the Mezhegey coal field project 27 Purchase of a non-controlling interest in theMezhegey coal field project settled by anoffset with a loan due to theGroup Note 4 40 30.
Commitments and Contingencies Operating Environment of the Group The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia.
The Groups major subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, theEuropean Union, theUSA, Canada and the Republic of South Africa.
Russia, Ukraine and the Republic of South Africa are considered to be developing markets with higher economic and political risks.
Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions.
The global economic recession resulted in asignificantly lower demand for steel products and decreased profitability.
In addition, the political crisis over Ukraine led to an additional uncertainty in the global economy.
The unrest in the Southeastern region of Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia caused the depreciation of national currencies, economic slowdown, deterioration of liquidity in the banking sector, and tighter credit conditions within Russia and Ukraine.
In addition, a significant drop in crude oil prices in the latter half of 2014 negatively impacted the Russian economy.
In December 2014, the rouble interest rates have increased significantly after the Central Bank of Russia raised its key rate to 17%.
The combination of the above resulted in reduced access to capital, a higher cost of capital, increased inflation and uncertainty regarding economic growth.
If the Ukrainian crisis broadens and further sanctions are imposed on Russia, this could have an adverse impact on the Groups business.
Management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the Groups business in the current circumstances.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect theGroups results and financial position in amanner not currently determinable.
Taxation Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
Further, the interpretation of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Groups entities may not coincide with that of management.
As a result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Groups entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and interest.
In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect to tax liabilities for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable.
Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on managements best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies continued Social Commitments The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns where the Groups assets are located.
The Group budgeted to spend approximately $70million under these programmes in 2015.
Environmental Protection In the course of the Groups operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings.
The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.
The Group has a number of environmental claims and proceedings which are at an early stage of investigation.
Environmental provisions in relation to these proceedings that were recognised at 31December 2014 amounted to $8million.
Preliminary estimates available of the incremental costs indicate that such costs could be up to $89million.
The Group has insurance agreements, which will provide partial reimbursement of the costs actually incurred.
Management believes that, as of now, an economic outflow of the additional costs is not probable and any pending environmental claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes coveringperiods from 2015 to 2022, under which the Group will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination.
As of 31 December 2014, the costs of implementing these programmes are estimated at $167million.
Legal Proceedings The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect on the Groups operations or financial position.
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities.
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement.
Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the support of outside consultants.
Revisions to the estimates may significantly affect future operating results.
