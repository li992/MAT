In the prior year, shareholders equity decreased primarily as a result of dividend payments which were not covered by the statutory profit for the year, and the repurchase of the perpetual subordinated capital securities.
The proposed final dividend would reduce shareholders equity by $106 million 2013: $95 million subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Details of share capital and capital reserves, revaluation reserves and retained earnings and related movements are included in Note 22.
