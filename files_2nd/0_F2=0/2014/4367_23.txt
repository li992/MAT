NoTes To The fiNaNcial sTaTemeNTs 1 segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses product group profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the Groups results as it reflects the Groups underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is defined as profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets but includes the Group share of post-tax profit of associate.
In April 2013, the Group reorganised from a divisional structure to a functional structure to become One Dairy Crest.
Prior to the reorganisation, the business was structured into divisions according to product types and this was used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments as Cheese, Spreads, MH Foods, Dairies, Share of Associate and Other.
Certain of these operating segments were aggregated and the Group reported on five continuing segments within the business: Cheese, Spreads, Dairies, Share of Associate andOther.
Following the reorganisation, the CODMs primary focus for review and resource allocation is the Group as a whole and no longer any component part of the business.
All revenue streams for the business are managed centrally by functional teams Demand, Supply, Procurement and Finance that have responsibility for the whole of the Groups product portfolio.
Although some discrete financial information is available to provide insight to the management team of the key performance drivers, the product group profit is not part of the CODMs review.
Having considered these factors, management has judged that following the implementation of the new structure, the Group comprises one operating segment under IFRS 8.
As such, disclosure required under IFRS 8 for the financial statements is shown on the face of the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet.
Voluntary disclosure To assist the readers of the financial statements, management considers it appropriate to provide voluntary disclosure on a basis consistent with historic reporting of the product groups.
In disclosing the product group profit for the year, certain assumptions have been made when allocating resources which are now centralised at a group level.
Associate forms a separate product group whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis.
The Other product group comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the other product groups.
Generally, central costs less external other revenue are recharged back into the product groups such that their result reflects the total cost base of the Group.
Other operating profit therefore is nil.
The results under the historic segmentation basis for the year ended 31 March 2014 and for the year ended 31 March 2013 and the reconciliation of product group measures to the respective line items included in the financial information are as follows: Year ended 31 march Restated 2014 2013 Note m m external revenue Cheese 264.6 231.3 Spreads 177.4 194.5 Dairies 944.8 951.6 Other 4.2 4.2 Total product group external revenue 1,391.0 1,381.6 Product group profit Cheese 39.3 33.1 Spreads 16.8 25.5 Dairies 18.8 9.8 Share of associates net profit 14 0.3 Total product group profit 75.2 68.4 Finance costs 5 9.9 18.7 adjusted profit before tax 65.3 49.7 Acquired intangible amortisation 2 0.4 0.4 Exceptional items 4 10.4 56.5 Other finance expense pensions 20 0.3 3.5 Group profit loss before tax 54.2 10.7 Before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and pension interest.

Group treasury has always been centrally managed and external interest income and expense are not allocated to product groups.
Further analysis of the Group interest expense is provided in Note 5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of product group profit.
Product group assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investments in associates using the equity method and deferred consideration but exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets.
Other product group assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the principal groups.
Inter-product group revenue comprises the sale of finished Cheese and Spreads products to the Dairies product group on a cost plus basis and is included in the product group result.
Other inter-product group transactions principally comprise the transfer of cream from the Dairies product group to the Spreads product group for the manufacture of butters.
Cream transferred into Spreads is charged by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reflect the costs that the Spreads product group would incur if it was a stand alone entity.
Revenue from inter-product group cream sales is not reported as revenue within the Dairies product group but as a reduction to the Dairies product groups input costs.
Product group depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 0.4 million 2013: 0.4 million as these costs are not charged in the product group result.
Product group additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

As a result of this consolidation the site at Crudgington, Shropshire is expected to close in the coming financial year.
The exceptional costs incurred in the period ended 31 March 2014 were 3.8 million 2013: 13.8 million, comprising plant and equipment write-down, termination costs and duplicate running costs.
The tax effect of this exceptional charge in the year was 0.8 million 2013: 2.8 million.
In February 2013 the Group announced plans to reorganise the business into a single management and operational structure from 1 April 2013.
This is replacing the divisional structures that previously existed and will lead to a more efficient and simplified organisation.
This reorganisation has resulted in exceptional costs in the year ended 31 March 2014 of 4.4 million 2013: 3.5 million comprising predominantly redundancy costs and the write-down of an intangible asset on the basis that there will be no future benefit from this asset following the reorganisation.
The tax effect in the year of this exceptional charge in the year was 0.8 million 2013: 0.8 million.
This project has now completed.
In December 2013 the Group announced that it was starting consultation with employees regarding the closure of its Proper Welsh Milk dairy in Whitland, Carmarthenshire.
The dairy was subsequently closed in January 2014 resulting in exceptional costs in the year of 0.6 million comprising plant and equipment write-down and redundancy costs.
In March 2014, the Group announced a strategic review of its FoodTec UK ltd subsidiary and an exceptional cost of 1.4 million has been incurred in the period comprising the write-down of its working capital, plant and equipment.
The tax effect of this exceptional charge in the year was 0.3 million.
In March 2013 the Group gave notice to the holders of its 2007 private placement loan notes that it would repay 100 million of principal in April 2013.
The costs of early repayment were accrued at 31 March 2013 as the Group was irrevocably committed to the repayment at that date.
Costs of 8.7 million predominantly comprise make whole penalties which were calculated based on the discounted future coupons between repayment date and original note maturity.
A further 0.2 million of costs have been incurred in the period ended 31 March 2014 comprising bank charges and professional fees relating to the transaction.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 85 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 4 exceptional items continued In the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group closed two processing sites in Aintree and Fenstanton.
Whilst these projects were largely completed within the year, 0.5 million of closure costs have been incurred in the year ended 31 March 2014 that have been offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of 0.5 million.
With effect from 1 April 2015, the corporation tax rate which was enacted on 2 July 2013 has changed from 23% to 20%.
The deferred tax calculations are now based on the lower rate resulting in a deferred tax benefit of 1.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Due to the size and one-off nature of this significant amendment in the enacted rate, it has been classified as an exceptional deferred tax credit in the period.
exceptional items in the year ended 31 march 2013 comprised: 9.2 million of costs associated with the rationalisation of administrative activities and other structural changes in the Dairies depot network.
This restructuring resulted in centralisation of back office activities supporting the depot network.
These costs related to redundancies 7.4 million, incremental operating costs associated with delivery of the project 1.1 million and write downs of property, plant and equipment 0.7 million.
The tax effect of this exceptional charge was 2.2 million.
The project has now completed.
In the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group closed two processing sites at Aintree in liverpool and Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire.
The closure of the sites and resultant changes in the supply chain, volume requirements and customer channels resulted in exceptional costs of 21.3 million.
These costs related to redundancies 9.0 million, duplicate running costs 6.2 million, asset write downs 0.7 million and other costs 5.4 million including stock write offs and duplicate running costs.

The effective pre-exceptional rate of tax on Group profit before tax is 14.6% 2013: 20.1%.
The effective tax rate continues to be below the headline rate of UK corporation tax due to the property profit income stream, on which the tax charges are sheltered by brought forward capital losses or roll over relief.
The higher level of property profits this year have reduced the effective rate of tax but we expect the effective tax rate to increase next year to approximately 18%.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23% from April 2013.
A further 2% reduction has been enacted, taking the rate to 21% from April2014, as has an additional 1% reduction, taking the rate to 20% from April 2015.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit from continuing operations by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price of ordinary shares during the year.
Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per share, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted losses per share.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings and diluted earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share has been calculated.
The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share including adjusted earnings per share is as follows: Year ended 31 march 2014 Year ended 31 March 2013 Restated Weighted Weighted average average no of Per share no of Per share earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m million pence m million pence Basic ePs from continuing operations 48.8 136.5 35.8 7.9 134.7 5.9 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.6 0.5 Diluted ePs from continuing operations 48.8 138.1 35.3 7.9 134.7 5.9 adjusted ePs from continuing operations Profit loss from continuing operations 48.8 136.5 35.8 7.9 134.7 5.9 Exceptional items net of tax 6.4 4.7 44.5 33.0 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets net of tax 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.2 Pension interest expense net of tax 0.2 0.1 2.7 2.1 adjusted basic ePs from continuing operations 55.7 136.5 40.8 39.6 134.7 29.4 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.6 0.5 adjusted diluted ePs from continuing operations 55.7 138.1 40.3 39.6 134.7 29.4 Basic ePs from discontinued operations 1.4 136.5 1.0 54.5 134.7 40.5 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.6 Diluted ePs from discontinued operations 1.4 138.1 1.0 54.5 134.7 40.5 Basic ePs on profit loss for the year 50.2 136.5 36.8 46.6 134.7 34.6 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 1.6 0.4 Diluted ePs on profit loss for the year 50.2 138.1 36.4 46.6 134.7 34.6 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 89 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 8 earnings per share continued There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of signing of these financial statements.

With regard to the Dairies CGU, goodwill was fully impaired in 2011 12 however given the low margins in this business and large movements in milk input costs during 2013 14, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment within this CGU has been reviewed along with its value in use.
The impairment methodology and key inputs for all CGUs are as set out in Note 11.
For the Dairies CGU, the discount rate applied to the value in use calculation was 9.3% 2013: 8.7% and cashflows are forecast to year five with nil growth assumed thereafter.
The key input assumptions in performing the impairment test were the profits expected from property sales, the allocation of corporate costs and the projected profit growth to 3%.
The impairment review has not indicated any required write down of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 March 2014.
However, the headroom was low and therefore sensitive to the discount rate used for each of the key input assumptions in deriving the projected cash flows.
In March 2014, the Group announced a strategic review of the FoodTec UK ltd ingredients subsidiary.
The carrying value of 1.1 million working capital and 0.3 million property, plant and equipment has been fully impaired in the year ended 31 March 2014 see Note 4.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 91 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 10 Property, plant and equipment continued Following the closure of the Proper Welsh Milk dairy in January 2014, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment of 0.5 million has been written down in full see Note 4.
As a result of plans to consolidate spreads production into a single UK location, the carrying value of some property, plant and equipment of 1.0 million has been written down in the year ended 31 March 2014 see Note 4.
2012 13 Following the decision in 2011 to transfer all Clover manufacture from Crudgington, Shropshire to Kirkby, liverpool, in September 2012 the Group announced plans to consolidate all spreads production into a single UK location at its site in Kirkby.
Subject to consultation, this decision will result in the closure of the site at Crudgington in 2014.
As a result of this decision 11.4 million of plant and equipment at the sites has been impaired to nil net book value representing managements best estimate of resale value net of costs of sale.
In addition, the land and buildings at Crudgington were impaired by 0.9 million see Note 4.
The culmination of the centralisation of administrative activity in the Dairies depot network along with the closures of milk processing sites at Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire and Aintree, liverpool resulted in impairments of 0.5 million to land and buildings and 0.9 million to plant and equipment see Note 4.

At March 2012 goodwill in relation to the Dairies CGU was fully impaired and the carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2014 is nil.
All groups of CGUs with goodwill are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 9.8% for Spreads and 9.4% for MH Foods and Cheese 2013: 8.7% for all CGUs.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specific risk factors.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for MH Foods and Cheese is 2.0% per annum being the estimated UK long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks 2013: 2.0% per annum beyond year three.
Thegrowth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Spreads is nil reflecting the minimal growth rates in that market 2013: 2% per annum beyond year three.
92 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 11 Goodwill continued The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2014 is: Dairies Nil 2013: nil MH Foods 6.7 million 2013: 6.7 million Spreads 65.5 million 2013: 65.5 million Cheese 2.1 million 2013: 2.1 million Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, initiatives implemented and associated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame.
For the residential business, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward offset by growth assumptions for milk&more, FRijj and the liquid milk business.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2013 14 and 2012 13 sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those units to exceed their recoverable amount.

Following the sale of 50% of the ordinary shares of WCl in June 2010, the Group equity accounts for a 20% shareholding in that company.
The Group holds a further 10% of the issued share capital of WCl however, due to the existence of fixed-price put and call options in relation to this additional holding, it is assumed that the economic benefit from this 10% has been transferred and therefore accounted for as a sale.
The fixed price under the options of 1.8 million Euros is recorded at its discounted amount of deferred consideration of 1.4 million.

The WCl options comprise call and put options over 20% of the company for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of WCls post-tax profits losses from June 2010 until the date of exercise.
This comprises a level 3 valuation, namely that it is not based on inputs observable directly or indirectly.
Management has valued this option by comparing the current equity accounted carrying value of the 20% holding with the estimated present value of consideration received from the exercise of the option.
The difference between these amounts comprises the option value of 1.6 million at 31 March 2014.
The principal input assumptions in valuing these options are i estimated future profits of WCl which have been based upon best available budgets and forecasts ii an appropriate post-tax discount rate of 6% and iii an option exercise date of 2018.
Over the period until exercise of these options, any movement in the fair value of these instruments is charged credited to the income statement.

This pension scheme is a final salary scheme that had previously been closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date and those members of the defined benefit pension scheme on its closure to future service accrual were invited to join the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
The Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund is administered by a corporate trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees directors are comprised of representatives of both the employer and employees, plus a professional trustee.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2013 by the Funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
This valuation resulted in a deficit of 145.0 million compared to the IAS 19 deficit of 56.3 million reported at that date.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out in 2016 17 on the 31 March 2016 position.
The Company adopted IAS19R revised 2011 for 2013 14.
As a result the interest cost and expected returns on plan assets of defined benefit plans recognised in the profit and loss have been replaced by the net interest on the defined benefit liability, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the net pension obligation.
Administration expenses are now charged as operating costs in the income statement rather than as finance expenses.
The following tables summarise the components recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit pension scheme.

In 2013 14 the Group paid 20.0 million into the fund in line with the agreed schedule of contributions plus an additional 40.0 million from the proceeds of the sale of St Hubert.
In addition to this, the Company granted the trustee of the Groups pension scheme to a floating charge over the maturing cheese inventories with a maximum realisable value of 60.0 million.
From October 2009, the Group has been making additional funding contributions to the scheme of 20.0 million per annum.
Under the latest schedule of contributions agreed with Trustees which was signed in March 2014, the contributions will be 13.0 million per annum for 2014 15 and 2015 16, increasing to 16.0 million per annum in 2016 17 reverting to 20.0 million per annum for 2017 18 through to 2019 20.
These annual contributions include 2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that are subject to a sale and leaseback agreement between the Group and the Fund as part of the schedule of contributions.
The land and buildings included in these arrangements are subject to long term leases and the Group will continue to benefit from substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
On this basis, under IFRS, these land and buildings continue to be recognised in property, plant and equipment and rental payments of 2.8 million per annum are treated as cash contributions, reflecting the substance of the arrangements.
The Group is entitled to any surplus on winding up of the Fund albeit refunds are subject to tax deductions of 35% at source.
Based on the present value of committed cash contributions at 31 March 2014 and the IAS 19 valuation at that date of 47.6 million, 10.1million would be deducted from any notional surplus returned to the Group and this has been recognised as an additional liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
However, it should be noted that cash contributions are determined by reference to the triennial actuarial valuation, not the IAS 19 valuation.
The actuarial deficit is greater than that recognised under IAS 19 since liabilities are discounted by reference to gilt yields rather than high quality corporate bond yields.
In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract.
A further insurance contract for retired members was purchased in June 2009 resulting in coverage for all members who retired up to August 2008.
These contracts are included within scheme assets and their value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
The purchase of the second insurance contract in June 2009 was funded by the sale of equities.
Subsequently, in order to re-establish an appropriate equity weighting of scheme assets, the Fund purchased equity total return swaps synthetic equity.
These instruments comprise an asset leg and a liability leg.
The asset leg generates a return based on UK and overseas equity indices and the liability leg incurs a cost based on lIBOR plus margin.
Credit risk is minimised since collateral is provided by the counterparties to the benefit of the Fund when the instruments are in the money.
At 31 March 2014, the valuation of the above comprises a positive equity exposure of 155.7 million and anegative lIBOR exposure of 152.4 million 2013: equity exposure of 276.8 million and lIBOR exposure of 233.9 million.
The 2013 14 results have been produced under IAS 19R revised 2011.
Administration expenses are now recognised in the income statement rather than as part of the actuarial gains and losses.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 103 The numbers Notes to the fiNANCiAl stAtemeNts CoNtiNueD 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued The effects of the adoption of IAS19R on previously reported results are summarised as follows: Originally Amended Reported IAS 19R Movement 31 Mar 13 31 Mar 13 31 Mar 13 consolidated income statement m m m Operating costs 1,368.2 1,369.1 0.9 Other finance income costs pensions 5.9 3.5 9.4 Profit before tax 0.4 10.7 10.3 Tax 0.4 2.8 2.4 Profit for the period 54.5 46.6 7.9 consolidated statement of comprehensive income Profit for the period 54.5 46.6 7.9 Actuarial gains losses 13.5 3.2 10.3 Tax 7.6 5.2 2.4 consolidated Balance sheet Deferred tax liability Shareholders funds Decrease in reported earnings per share: Basic earnings per share on profit for the year pence 40.5 34.6 5.9 Diluted earnings per share on profit for the year pence 39.9 34.6 5.3 Basic earnings loss per share from continuing operations pence 5.9 5.9 Diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations pence 5.9 5.9 Adjusted basic earnings per share from continuing operations pence 29.9 29.4 0.5 Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations pence 29.5 29.4 0.1 Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations pence 40.5 40.5 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations pence 39.9 40.5 0.6 The average duration of Fund liabilities is approximately 17 years 2013: 18 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indices with maturities matching the Funds expected benefit payments.
The Fund duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the Fund as a whole, the duration is around 18 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation including insured pensioners between deferred members duration of 24 years, current non-insured pensioners duration of 15 years and insured pensioners duration of 11 years.
The following table provides an analysis of the defined benefit obligation by membership category: 2014 2013 m m Deferred members 498.6 442.5 Non-insured pensioner members 215.7 196.9 Insured pensioner members 297.4 286.3 Total defined benefit obligation 1,011.7 925.7 The RPI inflation assumptions are determined by adopting a yield curve approach, based on the break-even rate of inflation implied by fixed interest gilt yields and index-linked yields.
Applying this approach to the Funds projected benefit payments gives an average break-even inflation assumption of 3.6% 2013: 3.5%.
The CPI inflation assumption is determined by reference to adjusted RPI rather than by reference to CPI-linked investments where the market is small and illiquid.
The principal differences between RPI and CPI are i the formula effect due to RPI using arithmetic means and CPI geometric means, and ii the bundles of goods considered CPI excludes mortgage payments and other housing costs.
The assumption used at 31 March 2014 is that CPI inflation will track 1.0% points below RPI inflation in the long term 2013: 1.0% and is therefore set at 2.6% 2013: 2.5%.
Pension increase assumptions are based on RPI with an adjustment to reflect caps within the Fund rules.
104 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued The annuity contracts purchased in 2008 and 2009 provide increases on post-88 GMP in line with RPI inflation up to 3% per annum.
However, since 2011 the post-88 GMP paid to members only need to increase with CPI inflation up to 3% per annum which is expected to be less than RPI.
It is therefore expected that the annuity contracts are expected to pay out slightly more than will be paid out to members so the asset valuation for the annuity contracts are 2.0 million higher than the corresponding liabilities.
Mortality assumptions were updated in the year ended 31 March 2014 based on analysis of the membership data performed as part of the March 2013 full actuarial valuation.
The result was an increase in life expectancy assumptions of approximately 0.9 years.
Details of the changes to mortality assumptions are detailed later in this note.
The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality.
If different assumptions were used, this could have a material effect on the results disclosed.
The sensitivity of the results to these assumptions is as follows: Expected Expense for 14 15 Service Net Total P&l March 2014 Cost Interest Charge Deficit Current Figures 1.0 1.8 2.8 47.6 Effect of a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate 0.6 0.6 15.4 Recalculated value 1.0 2.4 3.4 63.0 Effect of a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption 0.4 0.4 10.0 Recalculated value 1.0 2.2 3.2 57.6 Effect of a 1 year increase in life expectancy 1.1 1.1 25.4 Recalculated value 1.0 2.9 3.9 73.0 The above sensitivities assume that the Funds assets remain unchanged but in practice changes in interest and inflation rates will also affect the value of the Funds assets.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes an asset liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Fund by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the Fund.
In December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were fully hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts.
The Funds other investments include matching assets which protect against changes in bond yields and against inflation risk: the respective interest rate and inflation hedge ratios for these assets as at 31 March 2014 were 25.8% and 23.3% of those obligations not covered by annuity contracts.
The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create an increased deficit.
The Fund holds a significant proportion in a range of return-seeking assets which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to return-seeking assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Funds long term objectives.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Funds liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an expected increase in the value of the Funds bond holdings.
A significant proportion of the Funds benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher expected future inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in expected future inflation will also increase the deficit.
The majority of the Funds obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in higher benefits for some members.
This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the Fund.
At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.

The mortality assumptions are based on analysis of the Fund members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
It has been assumed that members exchange 25% of their pension for a cash lump sum at retirement.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date taking account of experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in the financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the defined obligation and the related current service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

The Group does not use any of the pension fund assets.
i This is debt issued by emerging market countries denominated in the emerging markets domestic currency.
The debt is almost entirely issued by governments and not by corporations.
Investors benefit from higher yields on the bonds due to the additional risks of investing in emerging market countries, compared to developed countries and it is also expected that the emerging market currencies will appreciate over time relative to developed countries.
ii Multi Asset Credit strategies invest globally in a wide range of credit-based asset classes which include bank loans, high yield bonds, securitised debt, emerging market debt and distressed debt of non-investment grade.
The investment strategies will also allocate amounts in investment grade credit, sovereign bonds and cash for defensive reasons.
The strategies are opportunistic and allocate dynamically to the best opportunities within the credit market from an asset allocation and individual security selection perspective.
iii Insurance linked securities are event-linked investments which allow investors outside the insurance industry to access insurance premiums for assuming various forms and degrees of insurance risk.
The underlying risk premium is a type of invent risk where the event is linked to natural or man-made catastrophes.
Thepremium paid to the investor represents compensation for the expected loss due to the uncertainty around the size and timing of the insured event.
iv Absolute Return Bond strategies are designed to deliver a positive return in all market environments and will take advantage of numerous alpha opportunities within the fixed income universe.
The objective of the strategy is to capture returns from active management in a number of areas within fixed income including interest rates, currencies, asset allocation and security selection.
The strategy will have long and short positions and employ a degree of leverage.
The strategies tend to have low sensitivity to the direction of interest rates and credit.
v Insight have been appointed to manage the liability Driven Investment lDI portfolio for the Fund.
The objective is to hedge a proportion of the Funds liabilities against changes in interest rates and inflation expectations by investing in assets that are similarly sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation expectations.
The current hedging target for the lDI portfolio is to hedge approximately 36% of the fixed and inflation linked liabilities of the Fund.
Currently the lDI portfolio hedges c20.7% and c23.3% of the fixed and inflation linked liabilities respectively.
Insight will seek to add interest and inflation exposure to the lDI portfolio over time in line with parameters that have been set by the Trustee.
Insight are permitted to use a range of swaps and gilt based derivative instruments as well as physical bonds to structure the liability hedge for the Fund.
In addition, Insight are responsible for monitoring market yields against a number of pre-set yield triggers and will increase the level of hedging as and when the triggers are met.

110 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 26 share based payment plans Group The Group has four share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy crest long Term incentive share Plan lTisP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder returns TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share.
From 2009, the TSR element was increased from 50% to 60% of the awards granted.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years.
In July 2013, a total of nil options was granted under the lTISP scheme July 2012: 1,094,734.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy crest sharesave scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme, which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
In December 2013, nil options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme December 2012: 2,390,456 options at a grant price of 281 pence.
Deferred Bonus scheme DBs From 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares and from 2011 in share options with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares is charged over four years being the year the bonus was earned and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued or from 2011 over which nil cost options are granted and the share price at the date of issue.
No deferred shares were awarded or issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2014 2013:nil.
The Dairy crest long Term alignment Plan lTaP The lTAP replaced the lTISP in the year ended 31 March 2014.
This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 50% of the award after 4 years and 50% after 5 years.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 111 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 26 share based payment plans continued The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2012 was 20.7% giving a fair value of 0.81 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2012 grant were: Expected share price volatility 22% risk free rate of interest 0.5% and dividend yield 5.22%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of option.
The lTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the lTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award in July 2012 was 65% for the TSR element and 100% for the EPS element giving a fair value of 2.75 per option granted.
The share price on granting 2012 awards was 3.34.
The nonmarket performance element of the lTISP is based on EPS and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the lTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2013 were as follows: Term 3 years Volatility 23% Risk free rate 0.4% Average volatility of comparator TSR 36% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 22% The expected life of the lTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.

29 Business combinations and disposals Year ended 31 march 2014 Disposal of Northern Depots As part of the ongoing rationalisation of the depot network, on 27 July 2013, the Group completed the disposal of seven depots located in the north-west of England for a cash consideration of 1.2 million.
The carrying value of assets sold was 0.8 million including net working capital and fees of 0.1 million resulting in a profit on disposal of 0.3 million.
The gain on disposal of these depots has been included in other income property in the consolidated income statement.
Disposal of Discontinued operation 1.4 million of the original tax provision resulting from the trading of St Hubert SAS St Hubert up to its disposal in August 2012 has now been released back to the income statement as discontinued operations.
The provision for taxes crystallising as a result of the disposal are unchanged see below.
Year ended 31 march 2013 Disposal of Discontinued operation Following a strategic review of the Groups overseas operations in the light of the inability to undertake synergistic acquisitions, on 28 August 2012 the Group completed the disposal of St Hubert SAS St Hubert for a cash consideration of 341.1 million 430.5 million.
St Hubert formed part of the Spreads reportable segment.
Cash held in the disposed business at that date amounted to 4.1 million, resulting in a net cash inflow to the Group of 337.0 million.
This amount has been reduced by fees of 6.2 million.
The disposal resulted in a post-tax profit of 47.7 million which can be analysed as follows: 114 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 29 Business combinations and disposals continued m m Sales proceeds cash consideration 341.1 Book value of assets disposed of: Property, plant and equipment 10.3 Goodwill 176.4 Intangible assets 131.5 Inventories 3.3 Trade and other receivables 14.9 Cash and short-term deposits 4.1 Trade and other payables 18.4 Current tax 5.5 Deferred tax 44.5 272.1 Gain on disposal before fees and recycling of exchange differences 69.0 Fees 6.2 Amounts reclassified to profit and loss 11.4 Pre-tax gain on disposal 51.4 Expected tax charge 3.7 Post-tax gain on disposal of Discontinued Operation 47.7 The expected tax charge principally comprises capital gains taxes resulting from the disposal as well as expected taxation on 74 million of dividends paid in the period up to the date of disposal.
These taxes were crystallised as a result of the divestment and as a consequence the breaking of the St Hubert tax group.
An estimate has been made of the likely tax costs resulting from these transactions however the final assessment has yet to be agreed with the French tax authorities which may result in a change to the level of tax provisioning.
As a result of the disposal the St Hubert business has been classified as discontinued operations.
The post-tax profit of discontinued operations can be analysed as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 march 31 March 2014 2013 m m Revenue 41.7 Operating costs before amortisation of acquired intangibles 27.5 Trading profit 14.2 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 3.0 Profit on operations 11.2 Finance income 0.1 Profit before tax 11.3 Tax credit expense 1.4 4.5 Profit for the year from Discontinued Operation 1.4 6.8 The cash flows of the St Hubert business in the period to the date of disposal can be analysed as follows: Cash flow from operating activities 0.3 Cash used in investing activities 0.6 Cash generated from financing activities 0.1 Net movement in cash and cash equivalents 0.2 acquisitions On 1 March 2013, the Group acquired the business and certain assets of Proper Welsh Milk Company limited from the administrators BDO llP for 0.3 million.

During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group acquired 7% of the share capital of HIECO limited for a consideration of 0.3 million.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 115 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 30 financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2013 and 2014, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: to maintain flexibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg: use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 19.
At 31 March 2014 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 414.0 million 2013: 627.3 million excluding finance leases of 1.8 million 2013: 5.5 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 2.1 million 2013: 17.8 million.
The facilities at 31 March 2014 and 2013 consisted of: march 2014 170 million plus 90 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and loan notes totalling 169.5 million repayable between April 2014 and November 2021. march 2013 170 million plus 150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and loan notes totalling 330.4 million repayable between April 2013 and November 2021.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2014 amounted to 208 million 2013: 297 million.
Effective headroom including cash and short term deposits amounted to 275.7 million 2013: 573.1 million.
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and by monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long-term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its floating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash flow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2014, 83% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2013: 100%.
Following the maturity and repayment of loan notes in April 2013 the amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities have increased in 2013 14 and the fixed rate percentage of borrowings has fallen.
In the medium term we expect the fixed proportion of borrowings to be in the target range.
The Groups borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 31.
116 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 30 financial risk management objectives and policies continued foreign currency risk Following the sale of St Hubert SAS, the Group has no significant operations outside the UK.
However it buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Dollars.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006, 2007 and 2011 the Group issued loan notes denominated either in $US, or.
Cross-currency swaps were implemented as required to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows.
These have the effect of fixing the liability and coupon in Sterling.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US or note debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
The Dairies doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 189.3 million 2013: 395.5 million.
Following the sale of St Hubert the Group had significant cash deposits and until those funds were utilised to repay loan notes and provide one-off funding to the pension scheme in April 2013, no one financial institution had deposits in excess of 60 million and all institutions holding deposits were required to be rated A or above.
All revolving credit facility borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2014 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 1.3 times March 2013: 0.6 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2014 or 2013.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The analysis of net debt is included in Note 33.
The gearing ratio at March 2014 and 2013 can be analysed as follows: Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 117 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 30 financial risk management objectives and policies continued 2014 2013 m m Net debt 142.2 59.7 Shareholders funds 289.4 307.4 Gearing ratio 49% 19% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy following the sale of St Hubert is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 1.5 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend for 2013 14 is 15.4 pence up 0.4 pence from last year 2013: 15.0 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014 amount to 21.3 pence 2013: 20.7 pence.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2014 83% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates of interest 2013: 100% see Note 30.
118 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 31 financial instruments continued The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2014 analysis below reflects lower reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2013 upside lIBOR expectations assumed last year were not realised and the assumption is that base rates will increase less than anticipated at March 2013.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding USD GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2014 was $204.4 million 122.4 million 2013: $308.7 million, 181.9 million.
These cross currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
Any gains losses arising from fair value adjustments deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next one to eight years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2014 was 41.3 million 36.5 million 2013: 75.0 million: 67.0 million.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next year being the life of the swaps.
forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then be reclassified to the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2014 of 208 million 2013: 297 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
In April 2013, 51 million of the facilities were cancelled.
Undrawn facilities expire in October 2016.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2014 121 The numbers Notes to the fi NOTES TO THE FINANCIA financial st l STATEMENTS AtemeNts C CONTINUED oNtiNueD 31 financial instruments continued interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Companys equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
