The key factor determining the identication of reportable segments is the regulatory environment in which the businesses operate.
Severn Trent Water is subject to economic regulation by Ofwat and operates under a licence to provide water and sewerage services within a dened geographical region in England and Wales.
Severn Trent Services is not subject to economic regulation and operates in markets in the USA, Europe and Asia.
The Severn Trent Executive Committee STEC is considered to be the groups chief operating decision maker.
The reports provided to STEC include segmental information prepared on the basis described above.
Details of Severn Trent Waters operations are described on pages 13 to24 of the Strategic report and those of Severn Trent Services on pages 25 to 32.
Transactions between reportable segments are included within segmental results, assets and liabilities in accordance with group accounting policies.
These are eliminated on consolidation.
The group has a large and diverse customer base and there is no significant reliance on any single customer.
The measure of profit or loss that is reported to STEC for the segments is profit before interest, tax and exceptional items underlying PBIT.

This includes a charge of 9.3 million arising from adjustments to prior year tax computations.
In the previous year a current tax credit of 29.2 million arose due primarily to an industry agreement over the treatment of infrastructure income in prior years computations.
105 105 Se Sev vern T ern Tr rent Plc ent Plc Annual R Annual Report and A eport and Accounts 2014 ccounts 2014 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 13 Taxation continued a Analysis of tax charge in the year continued Tax credits arising from unusual items in each year have been disclosed as exceptional.
An exceptional current tax credit of 59.2 million has been recognised, reecting the anticipated refund of overpayment of tax in prior periods as HMRC has now agreed that certain capital expenditure within our water and waste water treatment works is eligible for capital allowances as plant and machinery.
This has also resulted in an exceptional deferred tax credit of 56.2 million.
In the prior year the groups UK subsidiary companies adopted the new accounting standard FRS 101, which changed the basis for those companies corporation tax computations.
The most significant impact of this change is that certain amounts that had been taxed in previous years were recognised as profits and will be taxed in future periods.
Therefore, to prevent such items being taxed twice, the tax already paid on such items was repayable.
The impact of this change was an exceptional credit of 40.5 million to current tax and an exceptional charge of 38.8 million to deferred tax.
The Finance Act 2013 was enacted in the year and implemented a reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and then to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
This has resulted in a deferred tax credit of 114.8 million in the income statement and a deferred tax charge of 12.3 million in reserves.

15 Earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: i Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2013 2014 Restated m m profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 433.8 216.0 ii Number of shares 2014 2013 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 238.2 237.7 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options and LTIPs 1.1 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 239.3 238.8 b Adjusted earnings per share 2013 2014 Restated pence pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 88.4 92.6 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 88.0 92.1 Adjusted earnings per share gures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, gains losses on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2014 and 2013.
The directors consider that the adjusted gures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted gures set out above.

All of the groups goodwill is in the Severn Trent Services segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below: 2014 2013 m m Water Purication US 1.4 27.1 Operating Services US 11.2 12.3 Services Italy 2.2 2.3 14.8 41.7 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2m.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is revenue growth and margin.
Management of each CGU determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash ows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Post tax discount rate Pre-tax discount rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 % % % % % % Water Purication US See below 3.5 6.8 5.6 17.3 6.2 Operating Services US 3.5 3.5 6.8 5.6 9.1 6.5 Services Italy 2.5 2.5 6.5 6.8 8.8 8.2 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports except for Water Purication US where a growth rate of 3.5% has been applied for the first five years beyond the initial five year period which is then reduced by 2% per annum for the next 15 years with an extrapolation at the resulting growth rate at 25 years into perpetuity.
This reects managements best estimate of the prospects for the existing products and the businesss current product development expertise.
Specic discount rates for the CGUs are not available and hence a post tax discount rate reecting risks relating to the CGU has been estimated and used to calculate the value in use of the CGU from its post tax cash ow projections.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is disclosed above.
109 109 Se Sev vern T ern Tr rent Plc ent Plc Annual R Annual Report and A eport and Accounts 2014 ccounts 2014 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements As a result of the impairment review, the group has recorded an impairment loss against the goodwill in its Water Purication US CGU.
The recoverable amount of the business has been determined by calculating the value in use of the CGU using the assumptions described above.
16 Goodwill continued Goodwill impairment tests continued Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash ows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amount of Operating Services US or Services Italy below their carrying value are not reasonably possible and an impairment has been recorded in relation to Water Purication US.

By far the most significant business unit of the group is Severn Trent Water Limited, which represents 83% of group turnover and 76% of net trade receivables.
Severn Trent Water has a statutory obligation to provide water and sewerage services to customers within its region.
Therefore there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to its trade receivables and the credit quality of its customer base reects the wealth and prosperity of all of the commercial businesses and domestic households within its region.
None of the other business units are individually significant to the group.

The dened benefit pension schemes are funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent, professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last 10 years of employment.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension scheme STPS 31 March 2013 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2013 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK dened benefit schemes.
The dened benefit pension schemes will close to future accrual on 31 March 2015.
A new dened contribution pension scheme has been established and members of the dened benefit pension schemes will then become members of the new dened contribution pension scheme.

iv Actuarial risk factors The schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, ination risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the schemes investments.
If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Ination risk The benets payable to members of the schemes are linked to ination measured by the RPI.
The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of ination.
If ination is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Longevity risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of scheme members after retirement.
If scheme members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.

The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling 18 year corporate bonds.
The company has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benets Revised and therefore expected return on assets assumptions are no longer needed.
The discount rate is applied to the net deficit to determine the net finance cost.
The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the triennial valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2013.
The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows: 2014 2013 Mortality table used men SAPS S1NMA L SAPS S1NMA L women S1NFA L S1NFA L Mortality table compared with standard table men 116% 116% women 92% 92% Future improvement per annum 1.0% 1.0% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years men 21.3 21.5 women 24.4 24.6 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years men 22.6 22.7 women 26.0 26.2 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price ination and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 38 million Price ination Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 35 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 55 million In reality, interrelationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price ination.
The above analysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the dened benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the dened benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

The infrastructure reserve arose in the prior year on the groups transition to IFRS from restating Severn Trent Water Limiteds infrastructure assets to fair value as deemed cost.
In the prior year Severn Trent Water Limited adopted the new accounting standard FRS 101, which uses the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRS.
The infrastructure reserve was therefore recognised in Severn Trent Water Limited.
During the prior year Severn Trent Water Limited used its infrastructure reserve to issue bonus shares, which were subsequently cancelled.
These transactions resulted in a transfer from the infrastructure reserve to retained earnings in the financial statements.
The translation reserve arises from exchange differences on translation of the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries.
The hedging reserve arises from gains or losses on interest rate swaps and energy swaps taken directly to equity under the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 and the transition rules of IFRS 1.
35 Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: F to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued availability: F to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and F to maintain a exible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
The group does not have a specic gearing target but seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level, achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating, and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
During the year the group repaid an index-linked 169 million bank loan.
No significant new debt was raised in the year.
At 31 March the groups equity and debt capital comprised the following: 2014 2013 m m Cash and short term deposits 123.2 403.6 Bank overdrafts 0.4 Bank loans 594.9 758.7 Other loans 3,826.0 3,840.9 Obligations under finance leases 201.2 201.6 Cross currency swaps 51.4 100.7 Net debt 4,447.5 4,297.3 Equity attributable to the owners of the company 1,077.6 833.2 Total capital 5,525.1 5,130.5 124 124 Str Strategic r ategic report eport Go Gov vernance ernance Gr Group financial statements oup financial statements C Compan ompany financial statements y financial statements Other inf Other information ormation Se Sev vern T ern Tr rent Plc ent Plc Annual R Annual Report and A eport and Accounts 2014 ccounts 2014 Group financial statements Notes to the group financial statements 36 Fair values of financial instruments a Fair value measurements The valuation techniques that the group applies in determining the fair values of its financial instruments are described below.
The techniques are classied under the hierarchy dened in IFRS 13 which categorises valuation techniques into Levels 1 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The following table describes the valuation technique that the group applies for each class of financial instrument which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair value as at 31 March Fair value 2014 2013 hierarchy m m Valuation techniques and key inputs Cross currency swaps Level 2 Discounted cash ow Assets 73.1 109.1 Future cash ows are estimated based on forward interest rates from observable yield curves at the year end and Liabilities 21.7 8.4 contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reects credit risk.

The methods used and the changes from previous methods are summarised below.
The impact on the fair values disclosed in the previous years financial statements is shown in the table above.
Fixed rate sterling and currency bonds are valued using market prices.
Previously these bonds were valued by discounted cash ow models using discount rates derived from observations of credit spreads on a sample of the groups listed bonds.
Index-linked bonds are rarely traded and therefore quoted prices are not considered to be a reliable indicator of fair value.
Therefore, these bonds are valued using discounted cash ow models with discount rates derived from observed market prices for a sample of bonds.
Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash ow models.

The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the groups exposure to financial risk.
The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.
Interest rate swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in market interest rates.
Further details are set out in sections a i and e ii below.
Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies.
Further details are set out in section a ii below.
Energy swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in electricity prices.
Further details are provided in section e ii below.
Severn Trent Water, the groups most significant business unit, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to ination measured by RPI.
In order to mitigate the risks to cash ow and earnings arising from uctuations in RPI, the group holds debt instruments where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI.
a Market risk The group is exposed to uctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates.
The nature of these risks and the steps that the group has taken to manage them are described below.
i Interest rate risk The groups income and its operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to the risk of adverse cash ow impacts from increases in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease.
The groups policy is to maintain 45% to 90% of its interest bearing liabilities in xed rate instruments.
In measuring this metric, management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reect the amount that interest is calculated on.
Details of the adjustments made are set out below in the reconciliation of interest bearing liabilities to net debt.
At 31 March 2014 75% of the groups interest bearing liabilities was at xed rates 2013: 68%.
The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by borrowing at xed or index-linked rates and by using interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps the group receives variable rate interest and pays xed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
In practice the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount.
These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to xed rates.
The group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments to beyond 2030.
The cost of some of the groups debt is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This index-linked debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value that are also linked to RPI under its regulatory regime.
The following tables show analyses of the groups interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest.
Debt raised in foreign currencies has been included at the sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to changes in interest rates.
Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are excluded from this analysis.

Economically these swaps act to x the interest cost of debt within the group which is denominated as oating rate, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a credit of 66.7 million charge 2013: charge of 30.8 million in the income statement.

Although the group operates internationally and its net investments in foreign operations are subject to exchange risk, substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
In order to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance, the group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally yen and euro.
In order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations, cross currency swaps were entered into at the time that the debt was drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
The groups gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised in the tables below.
These show, in the relevant currency, the amount borrowed and the notional principal of the related swap or forward contract.
The net position shows the groups exposure to exchange rate risk in relation to its currency borrowings.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 23.
Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the board.
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved annually by the board.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

Its operating profits and cash ows are therefore exposed to changes in RPI.
In order to mitigate and partially offset this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt which pays interest at a xed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in RPI during the life of the debt instrument index-linked debt.
The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section a i Interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash ows relating to this debt are shown in section c ii Cash ows from non-derivative financial instruments.
Ination rate sensitivity analysis The finance cost of the groups index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in RPI rather than interest rates.
The sensitivity at 31 March of the groups profit and equity to changes in RPI is set out in the following table.
This analysis relates to financial instruments only and excludes any RPI impact on Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulated Capital Value, or accounting for dened benefit pension schemes.
2014 2013 1.0% -1.0% 1.0% -1.0% m m m m profit or loss 9.5 9.5 10.4 10.4 Equity 9.5 9.5 10.4 10.4 e Hedge accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally yen and euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 4.7 8.7 Euro 11.4 11.4 8.4 9.3 Yen 14.7 71.4 15.9 35.3 Czech krona 71.4 14.7 4.6 7.0 124.5 124.5 33.6 60.3 ii Cash ow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between xed and oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash ow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group also entered into a number of interest rate contracts with future start dates during the AMP5 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP5 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash ow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the yield curve prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps primarily settle net on a biannual basis.
The oating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.

Volatility has been calculated based on historical share price movements.
The risk free rate is derived from yields at the grant date of gilts of similar duration to the awards or share options.
The dividend yield is calculated using the expected dividend for the year divided by the share price at the date of grant.
The comparator group for the Share Matching Plan is the companies ranked 51-150 in the FTSE Index.
For the Share Matching Plan, dividends paid on the shares during the vesting period are accumulated and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition, in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.
39 Acquisitions and disposals In July 2012 the group acquired the trade and assets of Chlorine Engineers CECHLO business CEC for cash consideration of 1.3 million.
This transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
