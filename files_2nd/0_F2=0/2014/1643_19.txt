As set out in the introductory letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman the award opportunity for the CEO will be 150% of base salary increased from 120% of base salary and for the CFO will be 120% of base salary increased from 100% of salary.
As with previous years, the performance conditions for the award will be based on EPS growth over the three-year period from 2014 15 to 2016 17.
To reflect the increased opportunity under the plan, the Committee is proposing to increase the performance range for awards to be granted in 2014 as follows: Average adjusted diluted earnings per share growth per annum Proportion of vesting Current Proposed % of total Performance targets targets award # Threshold 12% 12% 25% Maximum 18% 20% 100% For comparative purposes, current targets have been adjusted down by 2% to eliminate the effect of the share consolidation completed in 2013 and which affected the base year for performance measurement targets.
# If average EPS growth is between threshold and maximum then vesting shall be on a straight-line basis.
