Please refer to note 23 Fair value methodology for further information on the fair value measurement and valuation techniques of investment property.

Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 54 b i.
23 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and for fair value disclosures.
It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows: Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are investment properties, certain private equity investments and private placements.
