Restricted shares issued to management Restricted shares issued to management are subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
All employees to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The performance period is typically up to five years where the employee must remain in employment for the shares to vest.
There are no market based vesting conditions on the share awards.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2014 and 2013 are detailed below and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2014 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The key assumptions used in this model for shares granted during the year ending 31 December 2014 were as follows: Group January August $000 Note 2014 2014 Quantity of shares issued 383 700 113 900 Fair value of shares issued $25.5 million $9.5 million Performance period 3, 4 and 5 years 3, 4 and 5 years Volatility 15.1 37.0%, 34.9% and 37.8% 24.3%, 24.3% and 24.3% Risk-free interest rate 0.78%, 1.65% and 1.65% 0.93%, 1.63% and 1.63% Dividend yield 0.7% 0.6% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 15.2 $68.4 $85.86 Weighted average exercise price - - 15.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares on each grant date.
15.2 Weighted average share price for the valuation is calculated taking into account the market price on all grant dates.
The market price at the award dates was $93.4 and $71.3 respectively and vested over three, four and five years in equal tranches.
The volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield had no significant impact on fair value but were consistent with those above.
The total fair value of the awards was $41.2 million over the vesting periods.

Employment cost continued Restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 The restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 were subject to directors remaining employed, as well as being subject to a market performance condition, being the companys relative TSR performance over three years against the HSBC Global Gold Index since renamed the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
This was assessed and had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares was based on the share price on the grant date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
Details of the awards that vested and lapsed in the year are shown on page 190 of this annual report, together with details of the award dates and market prices at award and vesting dates.
Restricted share awards granted to executive directors in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 The Restricted Share Scheme for 2011, 2012 and 2013 operates with conditional share awards, where the awards will vest in three equal one-third tranches subject to the fulfilment of performance conditions measured on an annual basis.
Shares awarded in 2014 are subject to one three-year performance period of assessment.
If the performance conditions are met, awards vest at the end of each performance period.
The 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards are subject to four performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth, additional reserves and absolute reserves.
The 2014 awards are subject to three performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth and additional reserves.
Grant date fair value was calculated using the market-based measure.
No dividends are attributable during the vesting period.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 168 to 190 of this annual report for more detail.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2014 and 2013 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
