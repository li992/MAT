At the balance sheet date, the group had unused tax losses of 8.4 million 2013: 9.9 million available for offset against future profits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Included in unrecognised tax losses were no losses which will expire in less than three years, and 0.5 million that will expire within four to seven years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these differences is not material at the balance sheet date.
During the period, reductions in the main rate of corporation tax were enacted from 23% to 21%, effective from 1 April 2014, and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
Deferred tax has been calculated using the 20% corporation tax rate.
These future reductions in the main tax rate are expected to have a similar impact as for 2013: however, the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.
