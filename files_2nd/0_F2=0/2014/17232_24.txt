To help achieve this, liability driven investments are used with the aim of matching the liability profile and future cash flows through the use of derivatives such as swaps and other investment instruments.

The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis, although the agreements do not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The profits shared with the Schemes are reflected in the Group financial statements as pension contributions.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 3.3m during the year ending 2 February 2014, and will make annual contributions of 6.6m for a further 19 years.

1 significant actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages : Financial assumptions 2014 2013 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities % p. a.

The mortality tables used at both year ends 2013 and 2014 are the S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy tables males females based on year of birth.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption by adopting 80% 60% males females of the long cohort longevity projections and also incorporating a minimum annual rate of improvement in longevity of 1.25% p. a.

2 Sensitivity analysis on significant actuarial assumptions The following table summarises the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if each of the significant actuarial assumptions listed above were changed, in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.

The Morrison Scheme is entirely funded by the parent Company and the Safeway Scheme is funded by Safeway Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Groups subsidiaries participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The current best estimate of Group contributions to be paid for the accounting period commencing 3 February 2014 is 52m 2013: 33m.
However, the triennial valuations currently being undertaken are not yet finalised: when they are, the amount of future contributions payable may differ from this estimate.
8.6 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION SCHEME The Group operated a stakeholder pension scheme, to which the Group made matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
This was closed to new members and employers contributions with effect from September 2012 following the introduction of the RSP.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Stakeholder pension scheme 5 9 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 9.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the sharebased award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Groups estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of a binomial stochastic model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is subject only to service conditions.
The schemes that launched in May 2011 and subsequently are under the new scheme rules, approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
The fair value of options granted and the inputs used to determine it are as follows: Grant date 13 May 2013 14 May 2012 17 May 2011 18 May 2010 Share price at grant date 2.92 2.79 3.01 2.70 Fair value of options granted 8.13m 9.12m 11.5m 9.7m Exercise price 2.25 2.36 2.28 2.37 Dividend yield 4.17% 3.69% 3.2% 3.04% Annual risk free interest rate 0.45% 0.53% 1.65% 1.63% Expected volatility 16.8% 19.4% 24.2% 26.5% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The discount is determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.
