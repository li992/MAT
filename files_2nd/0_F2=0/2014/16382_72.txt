COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED The Group has sublet part of the leased properties under operating leases.
Future minimum sublease payments of 7 million 2013: 12 million are expected to bereceived.
Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and services.
They do not include commitments for capital expenditure, which are reported in note 10 on page 105.
Contingent liabilities arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2014 was 1,406 million 2013: 719 million of which 1,250 million 2013: 561 million represents the maximum exposure related to assessments in Brazil regarding a local corporate reorganisation in 2001, as explained further below.
The Group does not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will result in a material loss.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
As previously disclosed, along with other consumer products companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities.
These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets.
In the second half of 2013 Unilever recognised provisions of 120 million related to these cases, disclosed within non-core items.
In the second half of 2014 these provisions were increased by a further 30 million.
Ongoing compliance with competition laws is of key importance to Unilever.
It is Unilevers policy to co-operate fully with competition authorities whenever questions or issues arise.
In addition, the Group continues to reinforce and enhance our internal competition law compliance programme on an ongoing basis.
As disclosed above, where specific issues arise provisions are made and contingent liabilities disclosed to the extent appropriate.
During 2004 in Brazil, and in common with many other businesses operating in that country, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service.
The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without valid business purpose.
The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructurings done by many companies in Brazil.
The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Groups favour.
However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter.
Additionally, during the course of 2014 another notice of infringement was issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments.
The Group believes that the likelihood of a successful challenge by the tax authorities is low, however, there can be no guarantee of success in court.
In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes.
In common with other businesses operating in this environment, the Group is required to exercise judgement in the assessment of any potential exposures in these areas.
Where appropriate, the Group will make provisions or disclose contingencies in accordance with the relevant accounting principles.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount which is generally fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed.
Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in net profit.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, other than those incurred in relation to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in net profit.
Changes in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill.
The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.
