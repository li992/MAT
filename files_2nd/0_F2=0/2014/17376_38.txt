If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realised, then no asset is recognised in relation to that portion.
If market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations, our existing recognised deferred tax assets may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits.
Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected, future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realisable.
As a result, all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may need to be reversed.
