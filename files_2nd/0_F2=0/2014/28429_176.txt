European Embedded Value Financial statements EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 295 Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
The table below shows how the VIF generated by the in-force business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over future years.
15 Sensitivity of results to alternative assumptions a Sensitivity analysis economic assumptions The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 and the post-tax new business contribution after the effect of required capital for 2014 and 2013 to: 1 per cent increase in the discount rates: 1 per cent increase and decrease in interest rates, including all consequential changes assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 1 per cent rise in equity and property yields: 10 per cent fall in market value of equity and property assets embedded value only : The statutory minimum capital level by contrast to EEV basis required capital, for embedded value only : 5 basis point increase in UK long-term expected defaults: and 10 basis point increase in the liquidity premium for UK annuities.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.

If the change in assumption shown in the sensitivities were to occur, then the effect shown above would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year.
These are for the effect of economic assumption changes and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition, for Jackson, the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital which are taken directly to shareholders equity would also be affected by changes in interest rates.
b Sensitivity analysis non-economic assumptions The tables opposite show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 and the post-tax new business contribution after the effect of required capital for 2014 and 2013 to: 10 per cent proportionate decrease in maintenance expenses a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of 10 per annum would represent an expense assumption of 9 per annum : 10 per cent proportionate decrease in lapse rates a 10 per cent sensitivity on a base assumption of 5 per cent would represent a lapse rate of 4.5 per cent per annum : and 5 per cent proportionate decrease in base mortality and morbidity rates ie increased longevity.
