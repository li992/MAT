StRAtEGiC REPORt GOVERNANCE financial statements AdditiONAl iNfORmAtiON Financial statements continued Land Securities Annual Report 2014 89 notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 Section 1 General This section contains a description of the Groups significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
A description of accounting policies specific to individual areas e. g. investment properties is included within the relevant note to the financial statements.
This section also includes a summary of new European Union EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have not yet been adopted, and their expected impact on the reported results of the Group.
Basis of preparation and consolidation Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, which is the presentation currency of the Group Land Securities Group PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings, and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Land Securities Group PLC has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income and separate income statement, as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006.
The loss for the year of the Company, dealt with in its financial statements, was 47.7m 2013: a profit of 298.5m.
The merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC.
The merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC.
The merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable profit.
The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of cancelled shares.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 incorporate the financial statements of Land Securities Group PLC the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings the Group.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or to the effective date of disposal.
Accounting practices of subsidiaries and joint ventures which differ from Group accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation.
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill.
Any discount received is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition as a gain on business combination.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date and any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the income statement.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as permitted by IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the period to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
Joint ventures with net liabilities are carried at zero value in the balance sheet where there is no commitment to fund the deficit and any distributions are included in the consolidated income statement for the year.
The Groups share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimations of uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Critical accounting judgements are disclosed in the relevant note to the financial statements.
The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most significant involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may differ from these estimates.
These areas are as follows: Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust REIT taxation regime note 13 Investment property valuations note 15 Trading property valuations note 17 90 Land Securities Annual Report 2014 notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 3.
Amendments to IFRSs not yet applicable The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the year ended 31 March 2013, as amended to reflect the adoption of the new Standards, Amendments to Standards and Interpretations which are mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The following accounting standards or interpretations were adopted for the year ended 31 March 2014 but have not had a material impact on the Group: IAS 1 amendment Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 12 amendment Income Tax IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits IFRS 7 amendment Financial Instruments: Disclosures offsetting requirement and converged disclosure IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Below are details of accounting standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet effective, or have not yet been endorsed by the EU, which may be relevant to the Group.
None of these standards or interpretations have been early adopted by the Group.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these new standards and interpretations on its financial reporting.
None of these standards are expected to have a significant impact on the Groups reporting, although some may require additional disclosures to be included in the notes to the financial statements.

The Group income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to revenue profit and capital and other items.
The total column represents the Groups results presented in accordance with IFRSs.
The year ended 31 March 2014 is the first period for which the Group has presented the income statement in this way.
The change in presentation is intended to reflect the way in which the Groups senior management review the results of the business and to aid reconciliation to the segmental reporting.
A number of the financial measures used by the Group to measure performance include the results of subsidiaries and joint ventures on a proportionate basis.
Measures that are described as being on a proportionate basis include the Groups share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries.
This is in contrast to the Groups statutory financial statements, where the Groups interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a redemption liability.
Measures described as being prepared on a proportionate basis are non-GAAP measures and therefore not presented in accordance with IFRSs.
Revenue profit is the Groups measure of underlying pre-tax profit, which is used by senior management to assess the Groups income performance.
It excludes all items of a capital nature, such as valuation movements and profits and losses on the disposal of investment properties, as well as one-off items.
A full definition of revenue profit is given in the glossary.
Revenue profit is presented on a proportionate basis and is therefore a non-GAAP measure.
Revenue profit is detailed in note 4.
Segmental information The Groups operations are organised into two operating segments, being the Retail Portfolio and the London Portfolio.
The London Portfolio includes all our London offices and central London shops and the Retail Portfolio includes all our shopping centres and shops, hotels and leisure assets, and retail warehouse properties, excluding central London shops.
All of the Groups operations are in the UK.
Management has determined the Groups operating segments based on the information reviewed by senior management to make strategic decisions.
During the year, the chief operating decision maker was the Senior Management Board SMB, which consisted of the Executive Directors with the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary in attendance.
From 1 April 2014, the SMB was renamed the Executive Committee ExecCom.
ExecCom comprises the Executive Directors, the managing directors of the Retail and London business units, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and the Group HR Director.
The information presented to the SMB and the ExecCom includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and group wide policies.
The Groups primary measure of underlying profit before tax is revenue profit.
However, segment profit is the lowest level to which the profit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the two segments.
The Group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and interest charges are not specific to a particular segment.
Unallocated income and expenses are items incurred centrally which are neither directly attributable nor can be reasonably allocated to individual segments.

Revenue Revenue The Group recognises revenue on an accruals basis, when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue comprises rental income, service charge income and other recoveries, proceeds from the sale of trading properties, finance lease interest and income arising on long-term development contracts.
Rental income includes the income from managed operations such as car parks, food courts, serviced offices and flats.
Service charge income includes income in relation to service charges together with any chargeable management fees.
Rental income, including fixed rental uplifts, from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives being offered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to fit-out or similar costs are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis.
Service charge income is recorded as income in the periods in which it is earned.
When property is let under a finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease.
Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and finance income as appropriate.
Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the finance lease.
Contingent rents, being lease payments that are not fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue on long-term development contracts is recognised according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work completed using the percentage of completion method.
An appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to work completed is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
All revenue is classified within the Revenue profit column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds on the sale of trading properties and income arising on long-term development contracts, which are presented in the Capital and other items column.
Also included in the Capital and other items column is the difference between the relevant line item on a proportionate basis and the amount included in the Group income statement.

Costs Costs Property and contract expenditure is expensed as incurred with the exception of expenditure on long-term development contracts see note 5.
Rental payments made under an operating lease in which the Group is a lessee are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are also recognised on a straight-line basis.
Minimum lease payments payable on finance leases, and operating leases accounted for as finance leases under IAS 40, are apportioned between finance expense and reduction of the outstanding liability.
Finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability.
Contingent rents defined above are charged as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred.
All costs are classified within the Revenue profit column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties and costs arising on long-term development contracts, which are presented in the Capital and other items column.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see below.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

The Group has changed the calculation and presentation of pension interest following the adoption of IAS 19R.
In accordance with IAS 19R, pension interest for the current year has been calculated and presented on a net basis.
The corresponding balances in the prior year have been re-presented to align the presentation but have not been adjusted as the impact is not considered to be material.

It will be paid on 22 July 2014 to shareholders who are on the Register of Members on 20 June 2014.
The final dividend is in addition to the third quarterly interim dividend of 7.6p or 59.8m paid on 11 April 2014 2013: 7.4p or 57.8m.
The total dividend paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014 is 30.7p 2013: 29.8p.
During the year the Company operated a scrip dividend scheme which provided shareholders with the opportunity to receive their dividend in shares as opposed to cash.
Shares issued in lieu of dividends during the year, all of which were non-PID distributions, totalled 61.1m 2013: 50.4m.
Following payment of the third interim dividend in April 2014, the Company suspended the scrip dividend and introduced a dividend reinvestment plan.

Income tax Accounting policy Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimations of uncertainty compliance with Real Estate Investment Trust REIT taxation regime On 1 January 2007 the Group converted to a group REIT.
As a result, the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
In order to achieve and retain group REIT status, several entrance tests had to be met and certain ongoing criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the notional taxable profit of the property rental business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a group REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business.

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.
The Groups property portfolio is a combination of wholly owned investment and trading properties, and investment and trading properties held through joint ventures.
Investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Both of these values are determined by the Groups external valuers.
The Groups wholly owned properties are presented as either Investment properties or Trading properties in the Group balance sheet.
The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Groups share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within Investments in joint ventures.
The combined value of the Groups total investment property portfolio including the Groups share of investment properties held through joint ventures is shown as a reconciliation in note 15.
Investment properties Accounting policy Investment properties are those properties, either owned by the Group or where the Group is a lessee under a finance lease, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both.
In addition, properties held under operating leases are accounted for as investment properties when the rest of the definition of an investment property is met.
In such cases, the operating leases concerned are accounted for as if they were finance leases.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition at cost, investment properties are carried at their fair values based on market value determined by professional independent valuers at each reporting date.
The difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or deficit.
Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and returns of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
This generally occurs on unconditional exchange, except where completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and, in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest.
Certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes during the construction phase are also capitalised.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be held as an investment property.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings after adjusting for borrowings associated with specific developments.
Where borrowings are associated with specific developments, the amount capitalised is the gross interest incurred on those borrowings less any investment income arising on their temporary investment.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Interest is also capitalised on the purchase cost of land or property acquired specifically for redevelopment in the short-term but only where activities necessary to prepare the asset for redevelopment are in progress.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimations of uncertainty investment property valuation The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental revenues from that particular property.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the property market.
The investment property valuation contains a number of assumptions upon which Knight Frank and JLL have based their valuation of the Groups properties as at 31 March 2014.
The assumptions on which the valuations have been based include, but are not limited to, matters such as the tenure and tenancy details for the properties, ground conditions at the properties, the structural condition of the properties, prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions.
These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2012.
However, if any assumptions made by the property valuer prove to be inaccurate, this may mean that the value of the Groups properties differs from their valuation, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial condition.

Investment properties continued Valuation process The fair value of the Groups investment properties at 31 March 2014 was determined by the Groups external valuers, Knight Frank and JLL.
The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards.
The valuations performed by the independent valuers are reviewed internally by senior management and relevant people within the London and Retail business units.
This includes discussions of the assumptions used by the external valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations.
Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between senior management, the audit committee and the external valuers on a half-yearly basis.
The valuers opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms length terms and using appropriate valuation techniques.
The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach.
Under this approach, forecast net cash flows, based upon market derived estimated present rental values market rent, together with estimated costs are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers opinion of fair value.
The average discount rate which, if applied to all cash flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.
Prior to their completion, properties in the development programme are valued using a residual valuation method.
Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions.
Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including finance and developers profit, to arrive at the valuation.
The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within Level 3, as defined by IFRS 13.
Accordingly, there has been no transfer of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the financial year.
The Other category contains a range of low value properties of a diverse nature.
As a result it is not meaningful to present assumptions used in valuing these properties.
Definition of terms For definitions of estimated rental value and equivalent yield, see glossary.
Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development excluding finance costs, together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants.

Trading properties and long-term development contracts Accounting policy Trading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue.
The gross amount due from customers for contract work is shown as a receivable.
The gross amount due comprises costs incurred plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings.
Where the sum of recognised losses and progress billings exceeds costs incurred plus recognised profits, the amount is shown as a liability.
Critical accounting judgements and key estimations of uncertainty trading property valuation Trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The latter is assessed by the Group having regard to suitable valuations performed by its external valuer, Knight Frank.
The estimation of the net realisable value of the Groups trading properties, especially the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion.
In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to significant variation.
As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Groups trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.
If the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based the valuation prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the net realisable value of the Groups trading properties, which would in turn have an effect on the Groups financial condition.

Net investment in finance leases Accounting policy Where the Groups leases transfer the significant risks and rewards of owning the asset to the tenant, the lease is accounted for as a finance lease.
At the outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is fide-recognised from investment property and recognised as a finance lease receivable.
Lease income is recognised over the period of the lease, reflecting a constant rate of return.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income within Revenue.

The total capital of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net debt.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
As the Group came out of the last property downturn, its objective was to see rising asset values reduce gearing and LTV ratios.
The table in note 21 details a number of the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.
A key element of the Groups capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets the Security Group.
This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates.
In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost.
In addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside of the Security Group structure in the Non-Restricted Group.
These assets include a number of joint venture interests, our interests in X-Leisure, and other properties where we have asset specific finance.
By having both the Security Group and the Non-Restricted Group, and considerable flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate finance for each specific asset or joint venture.
IFRSs require the Group to state a large part of its net debt at below its nominal value, however, we view our capital structure on a basis which adjusts for this see note 22 for an explanation of the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment.
This represents the 5.0% 2013: 40.6% interest in X-Leisure which we do not own but is consolidated in the Group numbers.

Borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings, other than bank overdrafts, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Where existing borrowings are exchanged for new borrowings and the terms of the existing and new borrowings are not substantially different as defined by IAS 39, the new borrowings are recognised initially at the carrying amount of the existing borrowings.
The difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value of the new borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the period of the new borrowings, using the effective interest method bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment.
Borrowings continued Medium term notes MTNs The MTNs are secured on the fixed and floating pool of assets of the Security Group.
Debt investors benefit from security over a pool of investment properties, development properties and the Groups investment in the Bristol Alliance Limited Partnership, the Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership and Nova, Victoria, valued at 9.7bn at 31 March 2014 2013: 9.3bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage the reduction in gearing see note 27.
The interest rate is fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years is LIBOR plus a step-up margin.
The effective interest rate includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.

Accordingly, the Groups available facilities at 31 March 2014 were 1,045.0m 2013: 913.6m, compared with undrawn facilities of 1,545.0m 2013: 913.6m.
All syndicated and bilateral facilities are committed and secured on the assets of the Security Group.
During the year, a 165m bilateral facility was repaid and the facility cancelled in full.
At the same time a new 250m facility was entered into.
600m of further facilities were also made available to the Group throughout the year.
All facilities acquired in the prior year business combination were repaid in full during the year and cancelled.
Queen Annes Gate Bond On 29 July 2009, the Group issued a 360.3m bond secured on the rental cash flows from the commercial lease with the UK Government over Queen Annes Gate QAG.
The QAG Bond is a fully amortising bond with a final maturity in February 2027 and a fixed interest rate of 5.253% per annum.
At 31 March 2014 the bond had an amortised book value of 317.2m 2013: 329.0m.
Fair values The fair values of any floating rate financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value, but adjusted for the effect of exit fees payable on redemption.
The fair values of the MTNs and the QAG Bond fall within Level 1, the syndicated and bilateral facilities fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable under finance leases fall within Level 3, as defined in IFRS 13.
Bond exchange fide-recognition On 3 November 2004, a debt refinancing was completed resulting in the Group exchanging all of its outstanding bond and debenture debt for new MTNs with higher nominal values.
The new MTNs did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTNs.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expense in the income statement.
Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits Accounting policy Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits represent cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that restrict the use of these monies by the Group and, as such, does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents as defined in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows.
Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit.

Cash and cash equivalents Accounting policy Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or fewer.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are deducted from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

The credit quality of cash and cash equivalents can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings of the counterparty where the account or deposit is placed.
Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy The Group uses interest-rate swaps to help manage its interest-rate risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair value of interest-rate swaps is based on broker or counterparty quotes.
Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for similar instruments at the measurement date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
Cash flow hedges: where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability of a highly probable forecast transaction i. e. an interest payment the element of the gain or loss on the derivative that is an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The associated gains or losses that were recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income are reclassified into the income statement on termination or expiry of the hedge.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting: the gain or loss on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and the non-qualifying element of derivatives that do qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates.
This valuation technique falls within level 2, as defined by IFRS 13.

Obligations under finance leases Accounting policy Where the Group is a lessee and enters into a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the lease is accounted for as a finance lease.
Finance leases are capitalised within investment properties at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current borrowings.
The finance charges are charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The investment properties acquired under finance leases are subsequently carried at their fair value.
2014 2013 Group m m The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: Not later than one year 2.2 2.1 Later than one year but not more than five years 8.6 8.4 More than five years 239.1 234.2 249.9 244.7 Future finance charges on finance leases 219.8 216.0 Present value of finance lease liabilities 30.1 28.7 The present value of finance lease liabilities fall due as follows: Not later than one year Later than one year but not more than five years More than five years 30.1 28.7 30.1 28.7 The fair value of the Groups lease obligations, using a discount rate of 5.0% 2013: 4.9%, is 43.0m 2013: 42.0m.

Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Financial review pages 24 to 27 and Our principal risks and how we manage them pages 32 to 35.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Groups financial performance and includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following table summarises the Groups financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, Disclosure: 2014 2013 Group m m Loans and receivables 447.3 405.4 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 3,705.3 4,133.1 Net financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss 3.7 19.8 Other 32.6 118.1 3,294.3 3,865.6 Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures, loans to third parties and commercial property backed loan notes.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of Aare accepted.
Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of the Groups tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a significant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in government infrastructure projects.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2019 and 2036, and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Management monitors the Groups available funds as follows: 2014 2013 Group m m Cash and cash equivalents 20.9 41.7 Available facilities 1,045.0 913.6 Cash and available facilities 1,065.9 955.3 As a proportion of drawn debt 28.4% 23.0% The Groups core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
StRAtEGiC REPORt GOVERNANCE financial statements AdditiONAl iNfORmAtiON Financial statements continued Land Securities Annual Report 2014 119 27.
Financial risk management continued Security Group The Groups principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most flexible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.
As at 31 March 2014, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 35.5% 2013: 37.7%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.
Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
2014 Less than Between 1 Between 2 Over 1 year and 2 years and 5 years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 683.1 183.0 950.7 3,863.6 Finance lease liabilities 2.2 2.2 6.5 239.1 Derivative financial instruments 5.5 3.5 Trade payables 12.9 Capital accruals 48.5 Redemption liabilities 2.6 30.0 754.8 185.2 957.2 4,136.2 2013 Less than Between 1 Between 2 Over 1 year and 2 years and 5 years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 625.4 264.8 981.8 4,429.2 Finance lease liabilities 2.2 2.2 6.7 259.1 Derivative financial instruments 9.1 7.9 2.8 Trade payables 6.6 Capital accruals 32.5 Redemption liabilities 118.1 675.8 393.0 991.3 4,688.3 iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates and availability of credit.
For financial instruments other than borrowings disclosed in note 22, the carrying value in the balance sheet approximates their fair values.
Interest rates The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest rate exposure, and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 80% of its existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming five years.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Specific interest rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt.
Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2014, the Group including joint ventures had 1.4bn 2013: 1.2bn of interest-rate swaps in place, and its net debt was 94.5% fixed 2013: 90.7%.
Based on the Groups debt balances at 31 March 2014, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the net interest payable in the income statement and reduce equity by 2.8m 2013: 5.0m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign-exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign-currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where significant committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identified, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to fix the Sterling value.
Therefore the Groups foreign-exchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign-currency exposure at 31 March 2014 or at 31 March 2013.

Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time value of money.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
If collection is expected in more than one year, they are classified as non-current assets.

Provisions Accounting policy A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a constructive or legal obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where relevant, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The relationship with the counterparty has been in place for more than six months, and there is no history of defaults.
The loan investment is not past due and is therefore not impaired.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Accounting policy Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Companys balance sheet, less any provision for impairment in value.
In accordance with IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions the equity settled share-based payment charge for the employees of the Companys subsidiaries is treated as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase in the Companys equity.

The fair value of each component of the redemption liability is determined as the present value of the amount the Group would be required to pay to settle the liabilities an exit price.
The terms of each arrangement are different, but generally the fair value is calculated by reference to a metric within the underlying subsidiarys financial statements, typically net assets or investment property valuation.
These inputs are not based on observable market data and therefore the redemption liabilities are considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as determined by IFRS 13.
In September 2013, the Group acquired an additional 35.6% holding in the X-Leisure Unit Trust X-Leisure for 104.1m, increasing the Groups holding from 59.4% to 95.0%.
This has resulted in a partial utilisation of the redemption liability.
The remaining redemption liability in respect of X-Leisure reflects the put option that remains in connection with the 5.0% of units in X-Leisure not held by the Group.
Net pension surplus Accounting policy Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, pension obligations are measured at discounted present value, while pension scheme assets are measured at their fair value, except annuities, which are valued to match the liability or benefit value.
The operating and financing costs of such schemes are recognised separately in the income statement.
Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method.
Net financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise and are included in interest income or expense.
Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2014 2013 Group m m Charge to operating profit 2.2 2.1 Defined benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a registered defined benefit final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Specific Funding requirements.
The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme, and UK legislation including Trust law.
The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.
126 Land Securities Annual Report 2014 notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 34.
Net pension surplus continued In setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost is expected to increase as a percentage of salary of the Scheme members, under the projected unit credit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2012 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2014 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2015.
As a result of the 30 June 2012 valuation, the Trustees and the Group agreed that, in order to address the deficit at that time, a combined employee and employer contribution rate of 44% of pensionable salary would be paid, together with additional employer contributions of 4m per annum, for a period of six years commencing on 1 July 2013.
Subsequent to March 2014, the Group and the Trustees have agreed a new schedule of contributions with the effect that employer deficit reduction contributions will cease from June 2014.
In addition, the Group has increased the monthly contributory salary payments to 37.8% of pensionable salary although this will decrease to 36.3% after 30 September 2014.
Since December 2013, employee contributions have been paid by salary sacrifice, and therefore now appear as Group contributions.
In the year ended 31 March 2014 employee contributions were 6.5% of monthly pensionable salary.
Employee contributions will increase to 8.0% of monthly pensionable salary after 30 September 2014.
The Group expects to make employer contributions of around 1.9m to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2015.
All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.

Net pension surplus continued The defined benefit scheme liabilities are split 13% in respect of active scheme participants, 31% in respect of deferred scheme participants, and 56% in respect of retirees.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at 31 March 2014 is 16.9 years.
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation at 30 June 2012 have been restated to the assumptions described by IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The major assumptions used in the valuation were in nominal terms : 2014 2013 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.60 3.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60 3.50 Discount rate 4.25 4.30 Inflation Retail Price Index 3.60 3.50 Consumer Price Index 2.80 2.70 The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2014 2013 Group Years Years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 31.1 30.9 Women 32.3 32.2 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 33.9 33.7 Women 34.2 34.0 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below.
These were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Schemes liabilities.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 1.6% or 3.1m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 3.0% or 5.8m In order to reduce risk within the Scheme, 10% of the Schemes assets are invested in annuities that match the liabilities of some pensioners.
The bonds that the Group holds are designed to match a significant proportion of the Schemes liabilities.
Since the year end, the Group has agreed with the Trustees to move half of the remaining equities into government bonds and liability-driven investment funds that match the liabilities more closely.
The Company did not operate any defined contribution schemes or defined benefit schemes during the financial year ended 31 March 2014 or in the previous financial year.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through the income statement.
These are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date.
Where the share awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
Where the share awards have a Total Shareholder Return TSR market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the options and other grants.
For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance criteria will not be met.
128 Land Securities Annual Report 2014 notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 35.
Share-based payments continued The total cost recognised in the income statement was 5.5m in the year ended 31 March 2014 2013: 2.9m.

The schemes have been split into two categories: Executive schemes and other schemes.
For further details on Executive schemes, see the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 76.
Executive schemes: Long-term incentive plan LTIP The LTIP is open to Executive Directors and senior executives, and awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, an award of Matching Shares can be made where the individual acquires Land Securities Group PLC shares and pledges to hold them for a period of three years.
Awards of LTIP Performance Shares and Matching Shares are subject to the same performance criteria and vest over three years.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, the transfer of treasury shares or the transfer of shares other than treasury shares.
The shares will be issued at nil consideration, subject to vesting conditions being met.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 938p 2013: 761p.
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 4.1m 2013: 3.7m.
Deferred bonus shares scheme The Executive Directors annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares.
The shares are deferred for one to three years and are not subject to additional performance criteria.
Awards made under the plan are satisfied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, which are issued at nil consideration.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 960p.
No deferred shares vested during the prior year.
The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was 1.4m 2013: 0.4m.
Conditional shares 23,641 shares were granted to an employee on their appointment in July 2010.
The awards vested in July 2013 leaving no conditional shares outstanding at 31 March 2014.
In the prior year, the 160,000 final conditional shares granted to R Noel on his appointment on 1 January 2010 vested.
The share price at the date of vesting during the year was 944p 2013: 744p.
Other schemes: Executive share option schemes ESOS The 2005 ESOS is open to executives and management staff not eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Awards are discretionary and are granted in the ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions.
Options are satisfied by the transfer of shares from the ESOT.
Options lapse 10 years after the date of grant.

The estimated fair value of options granted during the year under the scheme was 0.5m 2013: 0.5m.
Savings related share option schemes Under the Savings related share option schemes, Executive Directors and eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave scheme administered by Equiniti.
On completion of the three, five or seven year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the current market price at date of invitation less 20% discount.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for shares exercised during the year was 951p 2013: 800p.

The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, vesting exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.
Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions Fair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.
Awards made under the 2005 LTIP which were granted after 31 March 2009 include a TSR condition, which is a market-based condition.

Ordinary share capital Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The consideration paid by any Group entity to acquire the Companys equity share capital, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where own shares are sold or reissued, the net consideration received is included in equity.
Shares purchased by the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT are presented on the Group balance sheet as Own shares.
Purchases of treasury shares are deducted from retained earnings.

Remuneration of key management personnel The remuneration of the Directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the applicable categories specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Further information about the remuneration of individual directors is provided in the audited part of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 76.
Operating lease arrangements Accounting policy The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment and operating properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases.
Leases in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the lessor, are classified as operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants to receive the following future minimum lease payments: 2014 2013 m m Not later than one year 485.0 486.5 Later than one year but not more than five years 1,867.7 1,918.9 More than five years 3,261.5 3,371.1 5,614.2 5,776.5 The total of contingent rents recognised as income during the year was 38.9m 2013: 39.5m.
132 Land Securities Annual Report 2014 notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 continued 41. Business combinations On 16 January 2013, the Group acquired 322m units in the X-Leisure Unit Trust X-Leisure from Capital & Regional Units Limited and AREA X-L Limited, representing a 41.8% holding.
Prior to the acquisition, the Group held 92.5m units in X-Leisure a 12.0% holding, which was recorded within Other investments.
As a result of this transaction, the Groups holding in X-Leisure increased to 53.8%.
The acquisition increased the proportion of leisure assets in the Groups business in line with the Groups strategic objectives for the Retail Portfolio.
X-Leisure owns 99.9% of the X-Leisure Limited Partnership, with the remaining 0.1% ownership being with X-Leisure GP Limited.
On the same day, the Group acquired 100% of both X-Leisure GP Limited and X-Leisure Limited previously owned 50% by Capital & Regional Property Management Limited and 50% by AREA X-L Management Limited.
The acquisition of additional units in X-Leisure, together with the acquisition of X-Leisure GP Limited and X-Leisure Limited resulted in the Group obtaining control of X-Leisure from 16 January 2013.
The transaction was therefore accounted for as a business combination in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the 41.8% holding was 112.0m, being the cash consideration.
The previously held interest was re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date.
As a result of this, a gain of 2.3m was recognised in other comprehensive income and recycled to the income statement in the prior year.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition is set out in the table below: Fair value Group m Assets Investment property 545.0 Investment in joint venture 29.0 Finance lease receivable 18.4 Cash 25.2 Trade and other receivables 6.0 Total assets 623.6 Liabilities Borrowings 305.8 Trade and other payables 7.1 Accruals and deferred income 22.0 Derivative financial instruments 11.7 Total liabilities 346.6 Net assets 277.0 Fair value of previously held interest 32.9 Redemption liability 129.7 Fair value of consideration paid 112.0 Gain on acquisition of subsidiary recognised in year ended 31 March 2013 2.4 The fair value of the consideration, the redemption liability and the previously held interest were less than the value of the identifiable assets and, as a result, a gain of 2.4m was recognised in the income statement on acquisition within net gain on business combination.
Also included within this line were transaction related costs of 3.3m and the gain on the revaluation of the previously held investment of 2.3m.
The gain on bargain purchase of 2.4m reflects the discount achieved on the purchase of the units, together with the impact of the net fair value adjustments recorded on acquisition.
The fair value of trade and other receivables was 6.0m and included trade receivables with a fair value of 2.7m.
The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due was 3.9m, of which 1.2m was expected to be uncollectable.
In September 2013, the Group acquired an additional 35.6% holding in X-Leisure for 104.1m, increasing the Groups holding from 59.4% to 95.0%.
Additionally, in the year the Group has reassessed the fair value of certain assets recognised as part of the business combination resulting in the recognition of an increase to the net gain on business combination of 5.0m in the current year.
Pro-forma information During the year ended 31 March 2013 the acquired companies contributed 10.7m to the revenue of the Group and 4.9m to the profit for the year.
The pro-forma consolidated results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2013, as if the acquisitions had been made on 1 April 2012, would show an increase to revenue of 39.2m and an increase to profit after taxation of 14.7m.
In calculating the pro-forma information, the results of the acquired companies for the period before acquisition have been adjusted to reflect Land Securities accounting policies and the fair value adjustments made on acquisition.
The information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchases actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of future results of the combined Group.
