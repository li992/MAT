164 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY 3 Accounting policies: Anglo American plc the Company The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UKGAAP and in accordance with UK company law.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis asmodified by the revaluation ofcertain financial instruments.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Actual results may differ from those estimated.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
Theprofit after tax for the year of the Company amounted to $2,019 million 2013: $700 million.
Significant accounting policies Investments Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
For those share schemes with market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo model at the grant date.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using a Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the grant date.
For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings.
Equity settled share-based payments that are made to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Companys investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 28 to the Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014.
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted Anglo American plc intends to apply FRS 101 in its separate financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2015.
Any objections should be notified to the Company Secretary by 31 May 2015.
