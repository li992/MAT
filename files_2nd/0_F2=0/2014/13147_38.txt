Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information RELX Group Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2014 109 6 Share based remuneration The Group provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to Directors and employees.
The principal share based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Reed Elsevier Growth Plan REGP discontinued ater 2014, the Retention Share Plan RSP and the Bonus Investment Plan BIP.
Share options granted under ESOS and LTIP are exercisable after three years and up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
Conditional shares granted under ESOS, LTIP, RSP and BIP are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met.
Conditional shares granted under REGP are exercisable for nil consideration if conditions are met after three and five years.
Other awards principally relate to all employee share based saving schemes in the UK and the Netherlands.
Share based remuneration awards are, other than upon retirement or in exceptional circumstances, subject to the condition that the employee remains in employment at the time of exercise.
Conditional shares granted under LTIP, REGP, RSP and BIP between 2011 and 2014 are subject to the achievement of growth targets of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV adjusted earnings per share measured at constant exchange rates as well as the achievement of a targeted percentage return on invested capital of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV.
LTIP grants between 2011 and 2014 and REGP grants in 2013 are also variable subject to the achievement of a total shareholder return performance target.
The weighted average fair value per award is based on full vesting on achievement of non-market-related performance conditions and stochastic models for market-related components.
The conditional shares and option awards are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, being between three and five years, on the basis of expected performance against the non-market-related conditions, with the fair value related to market-related components unchanging.
Further details of performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 88.
