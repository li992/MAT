60 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2014 1 General information Synthomer plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on page 24.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and have a material impact on the Group: IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The adoption of this standard will have no impact on the primary statements.
The only significant impact will be an increase in the disclosure relating to the investment in joint ventures.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below: IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is a converged standard from the IASB and FASB on revenue recognition.
The standard will improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally.
This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting of revenue in the Group, however increased disclosure requirements are expected.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments, this standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39.
It includes requirements on the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities: it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the current incurred loss impairment model.
This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting, however an increase in disclosure is expected.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 48, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination see below and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cash generating unit level.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a Bargain Purchase, the excess is credited to the income statement immediately on acquisition.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 61 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstance that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held investment is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date: any gains or losses from such re-measurment are recognised in the income statement.
Acquired intangible assets Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases: Customer relationships between 5 and 8 years Technology 10 years Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent valuation reports.
Other intangible assets Software development resulting in development of a long-term intangible asset are measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Software between 3 and 5 years 62 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions in IAS 38 are met: an asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : it is technically feasible to complete the asset: management intends to complete the development: there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for required capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Except for freehold land and land grants in Malaysia, which are not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Operating leases Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease.
Any benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 63 Loans and receivables Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis.
At the point of factoring, the Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised.
The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised costs Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 22.
Impairment of financial assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
64 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the other gains and losses line of the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, restricted cash balances which become fully liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 65 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Retirement benefit costs The costs of defined benefit contributions to the Groups pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees service.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-administered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws.
The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed, where delivery is defined in accordance with Incoterms 2010.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.
Definitions Total sales Total sales represent the total of revenue from the Company, its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue of joint ventures.
Operating profit Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.
EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and special items as defined overleaf.
66 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Special items The following are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer indication of the Groups underlying performance: amortisation of acquired intangible assets: impairment of non-current assets: costs of business combinations: re-structuring and site closure costs: fair value adjustment mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied: amounts advanced in respect of invoices sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements: other non-recurring and non-operating items: tax impact of the above items: and settlement of prior period tax issues.
Underlying performance Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding special items.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements, and the inclusion of Financial Assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations see below, that the Group has made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Recognition of deferred tax assets The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, tax losses and accelerated capital allowances.
Determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high degree of management judgement and is dependent on managements ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss positions carried forward against future income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking the current and expected future market conditions into consideration.
Impairment reversal of impairment The Group has significant investments in property, plant and equipment, acquired intangibles and goodwill.
Changes in the circumstances or expectations of future performance of an individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired requiring the book value to be written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairments, excluding goodwill, are reversed if the conditions for impairment are no longer present.
Evaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may depend to a large extent on the selection of key assumptions about the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The growth rates used within the forecast future cash flows are developed with reference to external sources but are subject to estimation uncertainty.
See note 13 for more details.
Post retirement benefit obligations Included in the actuaries calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations.
These are shown in detail in note 25.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 67 Current tax liability and deferred tax The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on managements interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions.
The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon managements ability to properly apply what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% 2013 11% and 12% 2013 12% have been used in the above calculations for Europe and North America and Asia and Rest of World respectively.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts: for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of 2% 2013 2% and 5% 2013 5% have been used for Europe and North America and Asia and Rest of World respectively, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets concerned.
There is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2014, 70.5 million 2013 70.5 million is located in the UK.

The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk The Groups main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2013 none.
Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 0.8 million have been debited to the income statement in the year 2013 debit of 1.2 million.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign operations, which have a Euro functional currency.
These contracts, together with 160.0 million drawn on the multicurrency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 85 Interest rate risk profile Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2014 was: 2014 2013 Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings m m m m m m Sterling 2.3 10.0 12.3 19.9 30.0 49.9 Euro 124.7 124.7 148.5 148.5 US dollar Other 127.0 10.0 137.0 168.4 30.0 198.4 Cash and cash equivalents 24.9 59.0 Financial asset see note 17 5.8 Add: special item non-recourse factoring Net borrowings underlying performance 112.1 133.6 The effective interest rate for the year was 2.5% 2013 4.7%.
Sensitivity analysis The following table illustrates the effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in UK and US interest rates and in Euro and US dollar to sterling exchange rates, before the effect of tax.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities: A new five year, 210 million committed revolving credit facility.
This facility replaced the Groups main debt facility which comprised of a 178 million term loan combined with the undrawn 60 million revolving credit line maturing March 2015.
Both the introduction and cancellation of the respective facilities took place at the end of July 2014.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 14.1 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004 with a maturity date of September 2016.
$70.0 million of private placements was repaid in September 2014.

All pension benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2014 by a qualified actuary.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan deficit over the next seven years.
The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members widow and orphan benefits is re-insured by an external insurance company.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 89 The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2014 2013 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00% 3.30% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.30% Discount rate 3.65% 4.55% Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.30% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows: 2014 2013 Retiring today: Males 87.5 87.5 Females 90.0 89.9 Retiring in 20 years: Males 89.3 89.2 Females 92.0 91.9 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 1% Decrease increase by 54 million Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 12 million The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
The movements in the net liability arising from defined benefit obligation over the year is as follows: 2014 2013 Present Present value of Net liability value of Net liability funded arising from funded arising from defined Fair value defined defined Fair value defined benefit of scheme benefit benefit of scheme benefit obligation assets obligation obligation assets obligation m m m m m m At 1 January 315.9 255.6 60.3 301.5 232.0 69.5 Current service cost 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Interest expense income 14.4 11.6 2.8 13.9 10.7 3.2 Amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit schemes 14.9 11.6 3.3 14.4 10.7 3.7 Remeasurement: Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in interest expense income 13.0 13.0 16.4 16.4 Losses from changes in financial assumptions 42.4 42.4 12.0 12.0 Amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 42.4 13.0 29.4 12.0 16.4 4.4 Contributions: Employers 0.5 8.7 9.2 0.5 8.0 8.5 Payments from plans Benefit payments 11.7 11.7 11.5 11.5 At 31 December 361.0 277.2 83.8 315.9 255.6 60.3 90 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Post retirement benefit obligations continued Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2014 2013 m m Equities 124.4 120.5 Bonds 123.4 104.6 Property 24.4 22.2 Cash 5.0 8.3 Total fair value of assets 277.2 255.6 All investments in Equities, Bonds and Property are quoted.
The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 16.3 years 2013 15.5 years.
Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be 10.3 million in 2015.
Overseas pension schemes The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes net liability 66.2 million, 2013 51.3 million, where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Defined benefit schemes The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas defined benefit schemes has been compiled from a number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2014.
The largest of these schemes accounts for 45.4 million 2013 38.3 million of the deficit at 31 December 2014.
The major assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are: 2014 2013 Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00% Discount rate 2.20% 3.80% Mortality assumptions Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Groups defined benefit scheme.
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2014 2013 Retiring today: Males 83.9 83.7 Females 87.9 87.8 Retiring in 20 years: Males 86.5 86.4 Females 90.5 90.3 The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

In the Directors opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of these claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2014.
Fundamental restructuring The Group underwent a significant restructuring following the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011.
The cost of these restructuring programs is charged to special items in the income statement when permitted by IAS 37.
The provision reflects the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.
Liability arising on a business combination As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty property.
The provision reflects this onerous contract.
The provisions are expected to be fully utilised over the next five years.

On 22 October 2014, the Group acquired the other 50% of the share capital thereby obtaining control.
As required by IFRS 3, this transaction is accounted for as the deemed disposal of the 50% joint venture followed by the immediate acquisition of a 100% subsidiary.
Eka Synthomer Oy is a Finnish company with a plant in Oulu, Finland, where it manufactures styrene butadiene latex for sale to the paper and board industries with customers mainly in the Nordic region.

Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust The Company established a trust, the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met.
The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees Guernsey Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.
At 31 December 2014, the Trust held 82,425 2013 331,502 ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of 0.2 million 2013 0.8 million.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
All of the shares are under option.
Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 2.62 2013 2.07.
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the period was 0.32 2013 0.47.
The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions: 2014 2013 Weighted average share price 2.65 1.87 Option price Value of optionality nil nil Vesting assumption 12% 25% Given the option price is nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price is nil.
