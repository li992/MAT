The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 5.6m 2013: 5.8m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

Retirement benefit schemes continued UK scheme The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme the Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation.
The Scheme is funded by the Group and current employee members.
The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group.
The Scheme is governed by a board of trustees, composed of two member representatives, one employer representative and one independent trustee.
The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, funding together with the Company.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above.
Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group.
The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2014 is being carried out by a qualified independent actuary and the preliminary results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2014.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1.5m, comprising 0.4m in respect of benefit accrual and 1.1m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
