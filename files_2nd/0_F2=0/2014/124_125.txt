Notes to the Accounts Continued 8 Taxation continued The 2013 Finance Act enacted in July 2013 announced that the U. K. corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% by 2015.
A reduction in the rate from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2013 and substantive enactment of the rate of 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 also took place on 3 July 2013.
The deferred tax liability at 26 January 2014 has therefore been calculated having regard to the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 1% rate reduction in the corporation tax rate from 21% to 20%, although this will further reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.

The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
