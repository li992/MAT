Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 13 September 2014 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 762m 2013 585m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 790 million 2013 790 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and the sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles and any associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 790 million 2013 790 million.

Intangible assets continued A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs.
These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the board and reflects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, generally to between three and five years, using specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks.
105 The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country, industry and market risk.
The growth rates to perpetuity beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% and 5%, consistent with the inflation factors included in the discount rates applied 2013 between 0% and 3.5%.
Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Each of the groups CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of AB Mauri and the North China sugar business.
Notwithstanding a substantial improvement in profit in the current year, AB Mauri has continued to experience competitive pressure in a number of markets around the world.
Management has reviewed detailed forecasts for this business for a period of ten years to reflect the time required for completion of the dry yeast production strategy, and has concluded that the assets are not impaired.
Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance include improved reach and competitiveness in the global dry yeast market from the new yeast factory in Mexico, implementation of a number of margin improvement initiatives, particularly in cost reduction, and continuing growth in the global bakery ingredients business.
Headroom was $306m on a CGU carrying value of $1,078m 2013 headroom of $103m on a CGU carrying value of $1,195m.
The discount rate used was 12.7% 2013 11.5% and would have to increase to more than 15.0% 2013 12.1% before value in use fell below the CGU carrying value.
Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2.5%3% 2013 2.5%3% per annum dependent on location.
In North China Sugar, profitability has suffered as a result of low sugar prices and lower volume due to flooding.
Current forecasts for the North China Sugar business continue to support the carrying value of the assets, but the achievement of these forecasts depends on the continuation of significant improvements already underway in a variety of operational parameters, including agricultural yields, factory volumes and sugar prices.
Management has reviewed detailed forecasts for this business taking those issues into account for a period of ten years due to the nature and complexity of agricultural improvements and has concluded that no impairment is required.
Headroom was 43m on a CGU carrying value of 185m 2013 2m headroom on a CGU carrying value of 221m.
The estimate of long-term growth beyond the forecast period was 2% per annum 2013 2% per annum.
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri and North China Sugar, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to materially exceed value in use.

See note 8 for further details.
An impairment of A$150m 98m was recorded in 2012 in the Australian meat business.
Although good progress was made in the current year to reduce the factory cost base and improve efficiency, continuing retailer price competition and slower than forecast recovery in production volumes held back the rate of improvement.
Following a detailed assessment, management has concluded that the carrying value of the assets in the meat business is not further impaired.
Headroom was A$26m on a CGU carrying value of A$286m.
Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2.0% 2013 2.0% per annum.

Employee entitlements The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the UK and overseas.
The defined benefit schemes expose the group to a variety of actuarial risks including demographic assumptions such as mortality and financial assumptions such as discount rate, inflation risk and market investment risk.
The group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme specific risks.
All schemes comply with local legislative requirements.
The impact of applying the revised version of IAS 19 Employee Benefits for the first time is set out in New Accounting Policies on page 95.
UK defined benefit scheme The groups principal UK defined benefit scheme is the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members.
Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees.
The UK defined benefit schemes represent 91% 2013 91% of the groups defined benefit plan assets and 89% 2013 89% of the defined benefit scheme liabilities.
The Scheme is governed by a trustee board which is independent of the group and which agrees a schedule of contributions with the Company each time a formal funding valuation is performed.
The previous triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2011, using the current unit method.
The market value of plan assets was 2,559m, representing 101% of members accrued benefits after allowing for expected future salary increases.
By agreement with the trustees, the Company agreed to eliminate the deficit identified at the time of the 2008 triennial funding valuation with five annual payments of 30m totalling 150m.
Although the Scheme was in surplus at the time of the 2011 valuation, the Company made the final two payments in March 2012 and March 2013.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2014, was agreed by the trustees after the groups year end and revealed a surplus of 78m.
There will be no material increase in funding requirements.
The Schemes assets are managed using a risk controlled investment strategy, which includes a liability-driven investment policy which seeks to match, where appropriate, the profile of the liabilities.
This includes the use of derivative instruments to hedge inflation, interest and foreign exchange risks.
The Scheme utilises both market and solvency triggers to develop the level of hedges in place.
To date, the Scheme is fully hedged for 30% of inflation sensitivity and 24% of interest rate risk.
It is intended to hedge 80% of total exposure.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2014 F inancial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 12.
Employee entitlements continued The Scheme is forbidden by the trust deed from holding direct investments in the equity of the Company, although it is possible that the Scheme may hold indirect interests through investments in some equity funds.
The Scheme owns the freehold of an office building in London which is leased to the group at an open market rent.
The fair value of this building is 6m 2013 5m.
Overseas defined benefit schemes The group also operates defined benefit retirement schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded final salary schemes, as well as a small number of unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes, which are accounted for in the same way as defined benefit retirement schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the charge was 38m in the UK and 38m overseas, totalling 76m 2013 UK 27m, overseas 39m, total 66m.
109 Actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions for the groups defined benefit schemes at the year end were: 2014 2014 2013 2013 UK Overseas UK Overseas % % % % Discount rate 4.1 1.5 15.7 4.7 2.3 14.0 Inflation 3.4 0.8 9.2 3.5 0.0 10.0 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 0.5 10.7 4.5 0.5 11.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.2 1.2 6.3 3.3 1.6 8.8 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.9 1.2 6.3 3.0 0.5 8.8 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK defined benefit schemes are derived from the S2 2013 S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the 2013 2013 2009 projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males 2013 no rating and a 0.7 year rating down for females 2013 0.2 year rating up, both with a long-term trend of 1.5% 2013 1.5%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies in the UK defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2014 2013 Life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2014 2013 22.7 25.2 22.7 24.8 Member aged 65 in 2034 2033 24.8 27.6 25.0 27.2 Other demographic assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes are set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic funding valuation of the schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions for mortality, financial and demographic factors have been used.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure UK defined benefit scheme liabilities at 13 September 2014 is: Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate decrease increase by 0.5% increase decrease by 9.5% Inflation increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 8.7% Rate of increase in salaries increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 1.5% Rate of mortality reduce by one year increase by 2.8% A sensitivity to the rate of increase in pensions in payment and pensions in deferment is represented by the inflation sensitivity, as all pensions increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the specific assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivities, the same method used to calculate scheme liabilities recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The method and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis have not changed since the prior year.

Corporate and other bonds relating to UK schemes of 628m includes 46m 2013 4m of assets whose valuation is not derived from quoted market prices.
The valuation for all other equity assets, government bonds, corporate and other bonds is derived from quoted market prices.
The carrying value of UK property assets is based on a 31 March market valuation, adjusted for purchases, disposals and price indexation between the valuation and the balance sheet dates.
For financial reporting in the groups accounts, liabilities are assessed by actuaries using the projected unit method.
The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis, mainly due to different assumptions used to project scheme liabilities.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities comprise 33% 2013 31% in respect of active participants, 20% 2013 19% for deferred participants and 47% 2013 50% for pensioners.

Other deferred tax assets totalling 88m 2013 82m have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of 2,122m 2013 2,514m relating to investments in subsidiaries.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Acquisitions and disposals 2014 During 2014, the group acquired a bakery ingredients business in western Europe and a small animal feed specialist in the UK, which had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: Recognised values on acquisition Note m Net assets Non-operating intangibles 8 4 Property, plant and equipment 9 2 Inventories 4 Trade and other receivables 11 116 Cash and cash equivalents 5 Trade and other payables 8 Loans 23 4 Provisions 19 4 Employee benefits liabilities 12 1 Taxation 1 Net assets and liabilities and total consideration 8 Satisfied by Cash consideration 7 Deferred consideration 1 Net cash Cash consideration 7 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 5 2 Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from a 4m non-operating intangible recognised in respect of customer relationships.
The acquisitions in aggregate contributed revenue of 27m and adjusted profit before tax of 1m for the period between the dates of acquisition and 13 September 2014.
Aggregate contributions to revenue and adjusted profit before tax had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period have not been disclosed, as appropriate financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS is not available.
The net cash of 2m in the acquisition table above differs by 6m from the cash outflow of 8m on the purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement.
This difference relates to a 5m investment in an existing joint venture and 1m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions.
During the year, the group disposed of its interest in a US associate in the Ingredients segment for a profit of 7m.
Cash consideration was 12m, deferred consideration was 1m, share of net assets disposed was 2m and provisions made were 4m.
In addition, a charge of 9m was made in the Ingredients segment in China and India for restructuring costs associated with business closures, including a 4m impairment of goodwill.
2013 During 2013, the group completed no new business combinations.
Cash flow on purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of 75m comprised 71m of deferred consideration in respect of previous business combinations, a 2m investment in a joint venture and a 2m adjustment to goodwill for a previous acquisition.
Goodwill and deferred consideration were both reduced by 7m in respect of deferred consideration for previous acquisitions no longer payable.
Loss on sale and closure of businesses of 128m comprised 113m for disposals and closures in the Ingredients segment and 15m for the loss on disposal of the sugar business in Chifeng, north China.

Share-based payments The group had the following principal equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over a three-year performance period.
The Share Incentive Plan expired in December 2013.
The last grant of allocations under the Share Incentive Plan was made in November 2013.
Conditional shares allocated under the Share Incentive Plan will vest under the terms of the Share Incentive Plan.
Associated British Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP The LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 6 December 2013.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which will be released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over 117 a three-year performance period.
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 64 to 79.
Total conditional allocations under the groups equity-settled share-based payment plans are as follows: Balance Balance outstanding at outstanding the beginning Granted Expired at the end of the year awarded Vested lapsed of the year 2014 5,013,465 1,177,056 932,626 892,554 4,365,341 2013 5,175,939 2,067,195 1,273,950 955,719 5,013,465 Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust Ordinary shares subject to allocation under the groups equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust.
The Trust is funded by the Company.
Voting rights attached to shares held by the Trust are exercisable by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company.
At 13 September 2014 the Trust held 3,062,447 2013 1,995,073 ordinary shares of the Company.
The market value of these shares at the year end was 80m 2013 36m.
The Trust has waived its right to dividends.
Movements in the year were releases of 932,626 and purchases of 2,000,000 2013 releases of 1,273,950 and purchases of 500,000.
Fair values The weighted average fair value of conditional grants made was determined by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of the conditional shares allocated during the year was 2,226 pence 2013 1,345 pence and the weighted average share price was 2,393 pence 2013 1,446 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.

Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2014 F inancial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 24.
Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Financial asset liability Fair value determination Cash and cash equivalents Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities or Trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Trade payables, other payables and accruals Other non-current investments recorded within other These comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, non-current receivables unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price 119 is used to estimate fair value.
Other non-current receivables Fair values for these level 2 financial instruments have been estimated Loans and overdrafts by discounting expected future cashflows see below.
Finance leases Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable marketprices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is almost always available to assist with the valuation ofderivatives.
Provisions These are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Consequently, fair value is equivalent to book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives.
The group classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.
An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. market prices and rates or indirectly i. e. derived from market prices and rates.
An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where forward exchange rates and yield curve data, which are observable in the market, are used to derive fair value.
Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.
b Derivatives All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet.
The table below analyses the carrying amount of derivatives and their contractual notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which their fair value measurement method is categorised.

d Financial risk identification and management The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executivemanagement.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Financial instruments continued Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not in sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings.
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of the 121 designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within other comprehensive income.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars.
The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2014 2013 m m Euro 17 US dollar 174 532 174 549 A net foreign exchange gain of 29m 2013 loss of 26m on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders 2013 19m loss attributable to equity shareholders and 7m loss to non-controlling interests.
The group also held currency forwards and cross currency swaps that have been designated as hedges of its net investments in Australian dollars and euros, whose change in fair value of 4m has been debited to the translation reserve 2013 6m credited to the translation reserve.
f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but some are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting can be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure.
These instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates.
Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
Financial instruments continued The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk.
At 13 September 2014, 593m 61% 2013 730m and 63% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
Following the redemption in July 2013 of the 150m secured redeemable debenture stock, the majority of the groups fixed rate debt is the US private placement loans of 579m 2013 710m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates e. g. LIBOR.
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of interest rates on floating rate borrowings.
122 iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e on page 120.
Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12-month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial assetacquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar to movements in the sterling euro exchange rate: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.
Financial instruments continued The analysis of the groups foreign currency exposure to financial assets and liabilities by currency of denomination is as follows: 2014 Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 8 12 1 14 35 Trade and other receivables 23 52 9 84 8 35 53 23 119 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 25 186 31 12 254 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 9 420 1 1 431 123 34 606 32 13 685 Currency derivatives Gross amounts receivable 63 1,377 35 168 1,643 Gross amounts payable 1 126 660 110 897 62 1,251 625 58 746 36 680 604 68 180 2013 Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 7 13 4 6 30 Trade and other receivables 25 46 12 83 7 38 50 18 113 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 5 209 27 10 251 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 11 533 17 2 563 16 742 44 12 814 Currency derivatives Gross amounts receivable 41 1,122 134 131 1,428 Gross amounts payable 47 127 537 103 814 6 995 403 28 614 15 291 397 34 87 The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2014 2013 2014 2013 US dollar 1.66 1.56 1.62 1.59 Euro 1.22 1.19 1.25 1.19 Rand 17.43 14.37 17.86 15.76 Renminbi 10.18 9.68 9.96 9.71 Australian dollar 1.80 1.56 1.80 1.72 Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the groups operating currencies against local functional currencies would have had on profit and equity.
The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.
This sensitivity is presented before taxation and non-controlling interests.

The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 13 September 2014.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2014 2013 m m Cash and cash equivalents 519 362 Loans and receivables see note 24a 1,290 1,331 Derivative assets at fair value through profit and loss 8 1 Derivative assets in designated net investment hedging relationships 2 6 Derivative assets in designated cash flow hedging relationships 64 20 1,883 1,720 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has an established credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.
Financial instruments continued The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was: 2014 2013 m m UK 415 460 Europe & Africa 239 234 The Americas 154 149 Asia Pacific 318 340 1,126 1,183 Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2014 2013 m m 125 Not overdue 826 894 Up to 1 month past due 125 126 Between 1 and 2 months past due 21 15 Between 2 and 3 months past due 8 6 More than 3 months past due 29 27 Provision for doubtful debts 36 35 973 1,033 Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are not pastdue.
Trade and other receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts: 2014 2013 m m Opening balance 35 37 Amounts provided for during the year 5 7 Amounts released during the year 4 5 Amounts utilised during the year 3 3 Acquisitions 4 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 1 Closing balance 36 35 No trade and other receivables 2013 none were written off directly to the income statement in the year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging or net investment hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.
h Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i on page 126.
Financial instruments continued The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and compares them to carrying amounts: 2014 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 18 1,784 9 1,793 1,793 Secured loans 17 2 2 12 16 16 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 17 360 29 103 280 333 1,105 937 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 38 42 12 126 Provisions 19 51 20 15 1 14 101 101 Derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 5 1 6 6 Commodity derivatives net payments 32 8 1 41 9 Total financial liabilities 2,235 67 122 295 385 3,104 2,874 2013 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 18 1,649 7 1,656 1,656 Secured loans 17 39 12 37 7 95 95 Unsecured loans and overdrafts 17 345 28 157 165 557 1,252 1,059 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 38 42 12 Provisions 19 42 5 6 24 77 77 Derivative financial liabilities Currency derivatives net payments 20 18 38 37 Commodity derivatives net payments 10 4 3 17 1 Total financial liabilities 2,106 74 204 198 595 3,177 2,937 The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 13September 2014.
