Acquisitions and disposals We made a number of acquisitions during the year including the acquisition of a controlling interest in KabelDeutschland Holding AG and the remaining interest in our business in Italy, Vodafone Omnitel B. V. thus obtaining control.
The note below provides details of these transactions as well as those in the prior year.
For further details see Critical accounting judgements in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an  basis.
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.
Acquisitions The aggregate cash consideration in respect of purchases of interests in subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, is as follows: m Cash consideration paid: Kabel Deutschland Holding AG including fees of 17 million 4,872 Other acquisitions completed during the year 6 4,878 Net cash acquired 599 4,279 In addition, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Vodafone Omnitel B. V. as part of the disposal of the Groups interest in Verizon Wireless for consideration of 7,121 million.
The purchase consideration has been determined based on the acquisition-date fair value of the equity in Vodafone Omnitel B. V. being considered to be a more reliable method of determining fair value than estimating the attributable proportion of the fair value of the investment in Verizon Wireless.
The equity value has been determined on a value in use basis using discounted estimated cash flows using the methodology and assumptions detailed in note 4 Impairment losses.
Total goodwill acquired was 6,859 million and included 3,848 million in relation to Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, 3,007 million in relation to Vodafone Omnitel B. V. and 4 million in relation to other acquisitions completed during the year.

The results of the acquired entity have been consolidated in the Groups income statement from 27 July 2012 and contributed 1,234 million of revenue and a loss of 151 million to the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group during the year ended 31 March 2013.
The purchase price allocation is set out in the table below: Fair value m Net assets acquired: 1 Identifiable intangible assets 325 Property, plant and equipment 1,207 Inventory 34 Trade and other receivables 452 Cash and cash equivalents 78 Current and deferred taxation 788 Short and long-term borrowings 306 Trade and other payables 754 Provisions 249 Post employment benefits 47 Net identifiable assets acquired 1,528 Non-controlling interests 5 2 Negative goodwill 473 Total consideration 1,050 Notes: 1 Identifiable intangible assets of 325 million consisted of customer relationships of 225 million, CWW brand of 54 million and software of 46 million and are amortised in line with Group accounting policies.
2 Transaction costs of 11 million were charged in the Groups consolidated income statement in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The negative goodwill primarily arose from an upward fair value adjustment in relation to acquired property, plant and equipment, the recognition of acquired identifiable intangible assets not previously recognised by CWW together with the recognition of a deferred tax asset resulting from previously unclaimed UK capital allowances.
The change in the purchase price allocation from that previously disclosed relates to further deferred tax asset recognition following the completion of new long-term business plans.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of the losses of CWW see Factors affecting the tax charge in future years on page 122.
