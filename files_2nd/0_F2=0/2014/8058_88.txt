Deferred tax Accounting policy Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at that time.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the investor is able to control the timing of temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where there is an intention to settle these balances on a net basis.
