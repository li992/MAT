At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2014 2013 m m Within one year 69.6 74.1 Between one and five years 160.3 172.1 After five years 57.5 68.6 287.4 314.8 Principal lease commitments are within the Serco Global Services segment, with future minimum lease payments totalling 95.8m 2013: 114.0m.
These leases relate primarily to administrative and operational buildings.
Of the above, 97.9m 2013: nil is associated with assets which have been reclassified as held for sale.
Of this, 14.2m is due within one year, 44.3m is due between one and five years and the remaining 39.4m is due after five years.
Contingent Liabilities The Company has guaranteed overdrafts, finance leases, and bonding facilities of its joint ventures up to a maximum value of 26.2m 2013: 26.0m.
The actual commitment outstanding at 31 December 2014 was 21.4m 2013: 22.6m.
The Company and its subsidiaries have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance and other bonds, issued by its banks on its behalf in the ordinary course of business.
The total commitment outstanding as at 31 December 2014 was 192.1m 2013: 119.9m.
The Group is aware of other claims and potential claims which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received and the Groups insurance arrangements, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
On 31st May 2011, we filed a claim with the Authority for Advance Rulings to seek to confirm that Serco was not required to withhold Indian income tax from the purchase price on the acquisition of Intelenet.
The AAR declined to rule on the matter, so Serco filed a claim with the High Court to decide on the matter or direct the AAR to rule on the matter.
The High Court has currently reserved judgment.
Should the matter be decided against Serco, it would be liable for unprovided tax of 27m together with accrued interest to 31 December 2014 of 11m.
Having taken appropriate professional advice, Serco considers it likely that it will ultimately be successful in this matter.
In December 2013, following a review of billing arrangements on the EM contract by the Ministry of Justice, a settlement of 64.3m was reached in respect of contractual claims.
In addition, a 2.0m settlement was reached on the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services PECS contract which was also subject to Government review to reflect repayment of past profits earned on this contract.
The settlement was full and final in respect of contractual claims with the proviso that additional payments might be sought in limited circumstances, such as if criminality was to be established.
Serco continues to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations by the Serious Fraud Office.
Financial Risk Management 33. a Fair Value of Financial Instruments i Hierarchy of fair value The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are as follows: Level 1: inputs derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly : and Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2014 and the comparison fair values for loans and finance leases, are all considered to fall into Level 2.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.

The fair values of loans and finance lease obligations are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate associated with the liability.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach applying discount factors derived from observable market data to actual and estimated future cash flows.
Credit risk is considered in the calculation of these fair values.

The fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss is 17.3m 2013: 40.4m restated and relates to derivatives that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships.
The fair value of the derivatives and their credit risk adjusted fair value are not materially different, and are approximately equal to the amount contractually payable at maturity due to the short tenor of the instruments.
33 b Financial Risk The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that financial and non-financial risks are monitored and managed within acceptable and known parameters.
The Board delegates authority to the executive team to manage financial risks.
The Groups treasury function acts as a service centre and operates within clearly defined guidelines and policies that are approved by the Board.
The guidelines and policies define the financial risks to be managed, specify the objectives in managing these risks, delegate responsibilities to those managing the risks and establish a control framework to regulate treasury activities to minimise operational risk.
33 c Liquidity risk i Credit facilities The Group maintains committed credit facilities to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to maintain its ongoing operations.
As at 31 December, the Groups committed bank credit facilities and corresponding borrowings were as follows: Amount Drawn Undrawn Total facility 2014 2014 2014 2014 Currency millions m m m Syndicated revolving credit facility GBP 730.0 185.0 545.0 730.0 Amount Drawn Undrawn Total facility 2013 2013 2013 2014 Currency millions m m m Syndicated revolving credit facility GBP 730.0 175.0 555.0 730.0 The 730.0m syndicated revolving credit facility was signed in March 2012 and matures in March 2017.
It is unsecured and contains financial and non-financial covenants and obligations typical of these arrangements.
185 Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33.
Financial Risk Management continued 33 c Liquidity risk continued In addition to the banking facility the Group has outstanding US private placements of 584.8m which will be repaid as bullet repayments between 2015 and 2024.
In addition to the bank and private placement facilities the Group has a 60.0m receivables financing facility 2013: 60.0m of which 32.8m 2013: 27.1m was drawn at year end.
ii Maturity of financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities will be settled on both a net and a gross basis over the remaining period between the balance sheet date and the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
On demand or within one Between one Between two After five year and two years and five years years Total At 31 December 2014 m m m m m Trade payables note 27 99.8 99.8 Obligations under finance leases note 28 10.4 10.1 7.4 0.1 28.0 1 Loans 43.9 32.1 304.6 420.1 800.7 Future loan interest 25.4 22.4 61.2 48.0 157.0 Derivative financial liabilities settled on net basis 15.6 15.6 Derivatives settled on gross basis Outflow 457.5 35.1 111.3 603.9 Inflow 461.0 37.2 116.6 614.8 191.6 62.5 367.9 468.2 1,090.2 1 Loans are stated gross of capitalised finance costs.

Gross cash flows in the table above relating to forward foreign exchange contracts total 447.9m inflows and 444.2m outflows all on demand or within one year 2013: 521.8m inflow and 520.4 outflow, on demand or within 1 year, and 3.2m inflow and 3.3m outflow between one to two years.
Total loans on demand or within one year for the Group amount to 44.7m at December 2014 of which 43.9m is included above and 0.8m is classified as held for sale.
Financial Risk Management continued 33 d Foreign Exchange Risk i Transactional It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows.
At 31 December 2014, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions.
ii Translational Where possible the Group will raise external funding to match the currency profile of its foreign operations in order to mitigate translation exposure.
If matched funding is not possible, currency derivatives may be used to protect against movements in foreign exchange.
iii Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Page 208 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS39.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges against $231.0m of the US Dollar private placements.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these cross currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: 2014 2013 Receivable Payable Receivable Payable Notional USD GBP Notional USD GBP amount interest rate interest rate amount interest rate interest rate Maturity USD m % % USD m % % August 2015 11.0 5.7 5.7 22.0 5.7 5.7 May 2016 50.0 3.6 4.3 May 2018 100.0 4.4 4.9 October 2019 70.0 3.8 4.1 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
These derivatives are hedging highly probable forecast foreign currency trade payments in the UK businesses and highly probable forecast foreign currency trade receipts in the Indian business.
The net notional amounts are summarised by currency below: 2013 2014 restated m m Sterling 8.5 14.7 US Dollar 2.9 10.0 Euro 4.4 4.5 Indian Rupee 7.0 As a result of a prior year adjustment see note 4, the 2013 numbers have been adjusted to exclude the derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting.
All derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and as at 31 December 2014 a net fair value loss of 4.9m 2013: 2.2m restated has been deferred in hedging reserve.
During the course of the year to 31 December 2014, 2.7m 2013: 0.9m restated of fair value losses were transferred to the hedging reserve, and nil 2013: nil restated reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
iv Currency sensitivity The Groups currency exposures in respect of monetary items at 31 December 2014 that result in net currency gains and losses in the income statement and equity arise principally from movement in US Dollar and Indian Rupee exchange rates.
At 31 December 2014, if both had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have increased by 13.0m 2013: 17.1m increase restated, comprising USD 19.7m increase and INR 6.7m decrease and equity would have decreased by 0.4m 2013: 0.9m decrease restated, comprising USD 0.4m.
The underlying currency exposures are 217.0m 2013: 364.0m for USD, and a 53.3m 2013: 110.5m for INR.
These exposures are principally the result of prior year adjustments, which resulted in exposures previously treated as being hedged becoming unhedged at 31 December 2014 see note 4.
187 Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33.
Financial Risk Management continued 33 e Interest Rate Risk The Groups policy is to minimise the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings to provide an appropriate level of certainty to cost of funds.
Exposure to interest rate risk arises principally on changes to US Dollar and Sterling interest rates.
i Interest rate management An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below: Weighted Weighted average average Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 Financial assets m m % m m % Cash and cash equivalents 180.1 125.1 Other loan receivables 1.0 1.1 4.7 3.30 181.1 126.2 4.7 Weighted Weighted average average Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate 2014 2014 2014 2013 2013 2013 Financial liabilities m m % m m % Non-recourse Sterling loans 20.3 3.62 Sterling loans 205.3 16.6 2.72 200.1 33.2 2.30 US Dollar loans 568.2 4.12 1.5 541.6 4.09 Other loans 10.6 11.6 215.9 584.8 213.2 595.1 Total cash and cash equivalents held by the Group at 31 December 2014 amount to 202.5m 2013: 125.1m and include 180.1m 2013: 125.1m shown above and 22.4m 2013: nil included within amounts held for sale on the balance sheet.
Total floating rate and fixed rate loans held by the Group at 31 December 2014 amount to 216.7m 2013: 213.2m and 608.8m 2013: 595.1m respectively and include 215.9m 2013: 213.2m and 584.8m 2013: 595.1m shown above and 0.8m 2013: nil and 24.0m 2013: nil included within amounts held for sale on the balance sheet.
Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated through the issuance of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate derivatives.
Excluded from the above analysis is 26.5m 2013: 68.0m of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
ii Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2014 relate to interest rate risk management on debt held locally within the Group.
Notional Payable USD Receivable USD Receivable JPY Value interest rate interest rate interest rate 2014 2014 2014 2014 Maturity USD m % % % January 2015 1.3 6.30 3 month USD LIBOR 2.0 Notional Payable USD Receivable USD Receivable JPY Value interest rate interest rate interest rate 2013 2013 2013 2013 Maturity USD m % % % March 2014 0.5 6.89 3 month JPY LIBOR 1.0 January 2015 2.5 6.30 3 month USD LIBOR 2.0 iii Interest rate sensitivity The effect of a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR rates on the net financial liability position at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a reduction in post-tax profit for the year to 31 December 2014 of 0.1m 2013: 0.7m.
Financial Risk Management continued 33 f Credit Risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty could default on its contractual obligations.
In this regard, the Groups principle exposure is to cash and cash equivalents, derivative transactions and trade receivables.
The Groups trade receivables credit risk is relatively low given that a high proportion of our customer base are Government bodies with strong sovereign, or sovereign like, credit ratings.
However, where the assessed credit worthiness of a customer, Government or non-government, falls below that considered acceptable, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate against the risk of contractual default using instruments such as credit guarantees.
The Groups Treasury function only transacts with counterparties that comply with Board policy.
The credit risk is measured by way of a counterparty credit rating and as a minimum any counterparty must have a long term public rating of Single A from any two recognised rating agencies.
Pre-approved limits are set based on a rating matrix and exposures monitored accordingly.
The Group also employs the use of set-off rights in some agreements.
33 g Capital Risk The Boards objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives, including but not limited to reshaping the portfolio through mergers, acquisitions and disposals.
In doing so the Board seeks to manage funding and liquidity risk, optimise shareholder return and maintain an implied investment grade credit position.
This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
The Board reviews and approves at least annually a treasury policy document which covers, inter alia, funding and liquidity risk, capital structure and risk management.
This policy details targets for committed funding headroom, diversification of committed funding and debt maturity profile.
The Group plans to maintain sufficient funds and distributable reserves to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders.
