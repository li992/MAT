72 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements General information PZ Cussons Plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London stock exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page109.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union EU, including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting under IFRS.
Further standards may be issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and standards currently in issue and endorsed bythe EU may be subject to interpretations issued by theIFRIC.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from thoseestimates.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fairvalue.
The financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies except as statedbelow.
Standards and interpretations The following new and amended standards are relevant to the Group and have been adopted for the first time in these financialstatements: IAS 19 Employee benefits Revised changes a number of disclosure requirements and restricts the accounting options available for defined benefit pension plans.
The expected return on pension plan assets and finance charges have been replaced by a net interest expense, calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability.
Administration costs by pension funds will now be recognised as an expense when the administrative services are performed.
The revised standard requires retrospective application, however the impact on the years ended 31 May 2012 and 31 May 2013 was not material and therefore the prior year comparatives have not beenrestated.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures introduces new disclosures of information about the significance of financial instruments to anentity.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement explains how to measure fair value and enhances fair value disclosures.
The standard does not significantly change the measurement of fair value but codifies it in oneplace.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires items of Other Comprehensive Income that may be reclassified toprofit or loss being presented separately from items that will never bereclassified.
Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes on deferredtax.

All of the following new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective from 1 January 2014 unless otherwise stated.
Standards have not yet been endorsed by the EU unless otherwisestated.

73 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts 1.
Accounting policies continued On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement inthe period ofacquisition.
The total profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement and the interest of non-controlling interests is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interests interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The interest of non-controlling interests in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where non-controlling interests are acquired, the excess of cost over the value of the non-controlling interest acquired is recorded inequity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained or up to the date control islost.
Where necessary, the accounts of overseas subsidiaries are adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated onconsolidation.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit of the Group before finance income, finance costs andtaxation.
Exceptional items The Group adopts a columnar income statement format to highlight significant items within the Group results for the period.
Such items are considered by the Directors to be exceptional in nature rather than being representative of the underlying trading of the Group, and may include such items as restructuring costs, acquisition related costs, material impairments of non-current assets, material profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, brands, profit or loss on disposal or termination of operations and material pension settlements and amendments.
The Directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature should be disclosed in a separate column of the income statement and notes to the financial statements as Exceptional items.
The Directorsbelieve that the separate disclosure of these items is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financialperformance.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The fair value of consideration of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred as exceptionalitems.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under IAS 28 Investments in associates and IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures, a single figure for post-tax results is presented as a separate item on the face of the income statement as part of profit before tax within operating profit.
Investments and long-term loans which are considered to be permanent as equity are combined with the Groups share of net assets liabilities and shown on a single line within non-currentassets.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.
Goodwill also includes amounts to reflect deferred tax liabilities established in relation to acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at leastannually.
74 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss ondisposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss ondisposal.
Other intangible assets An acquired brand is only recognised on the balance sheet where it is supported by a registered trademark, where brand earnings are separately identifiable and the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business.
Brands acquired as part of a business combination are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Trademarks, patents and purchased brands are recorded at purchase cost.
Brands currently held are not amortised as the Directors believe they have indefinite lives due to their market leading nature.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, the brands are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is anindication that the asset may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.
Applying indefinite lives to certain acquired brands is appropriate due to the stable long-term nature of the business and the enduring nature of the brands.
A core element of the Groups strategy is to invest in building its brands through an ongoing programme of product innovation and renovation and sustained and rising marketing particularly media investment.
Indefinite life brands are allocated to the cash generating units to which they relate and are tested annually forimpairment.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income.
Profitorlosses on disposal of brands are included within operating profit within exceptionalitems.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates and sales related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Sales of goods are recognised when title has passed and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred which is generally on receipt or collection by customers.
Should management consider that the criteria for recognition are not met, revenue is deferred until such time as the consideration has been fullyearned.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operatingleases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the leaseterm.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financialstatements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the actual rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheetdate.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the incomestatement.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forwardcontracts.
75 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts 1.
Accounting policies continued On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising on the translation and consolidation of foreign operations income statements and balance sheets denominated in foreign currencies are recorded as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences will be transferred to the income statement in the period of the disposal as part of the gain or loss ondisposal.
Finance income and costs Finance income and costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they areincurred.
Government grants Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are reflected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
Government grants relating to income are reflected in the balance sheet asdeferred income and credited to the income statement over the period to which the grantrelates.
Employee benefits Share-based payments The Group operates a Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and an Executive Share Option Scheme for senior executives, all of which involve equity-settled share-basedpayments.
Equity-settled share-based payments under the Executive Share Option Scheme are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and .
The awards under the Performance Share Plan are measured at the fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting periodbased on the expected outcome of the vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the numberof options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment toequity.
The awards under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the vestingperiod.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and are provided for or charged to Income .
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferredtax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheetdate.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accountingprofit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with inequity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a netbasis.
76 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administration purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All other assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of theitem.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straightline method, on the followingbasis: Freehold buildings at rates not less than 2% Leasehold buildings at rates which will reduce the book value to nil on or before the termination of the leases with a minimum of 2% Plant and machinery not less than 8% Fixtures, fittings and vehicles not less than 20% In the case of major projects depreciation is provided from the date the project in question is brought into use.
Land and assets in the course of construction are notdepreciated.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for theperiod.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheetdate.
Property, plant and equipment that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reportingdate.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling anddistribution.
Where net realisable value is lower than cost, provision for impairment is made which is charged to cost of sales in the incomestatement.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables and is measured as the difference between carrying value and present value of estimated future cash flows.
Subsequent recoveries of previously impaired trade receivables are recognised as a credit to profit asrecorded.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38 Intangibleassets.
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash at bank and in hand plus short-term deposits less overdrafts.
Short-term deposits have a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cashmanagement.
Where the Group has the legally enforceable right and intends to settle balances on a net basis bank overdrafts and cash balances are offset and presented on a net basis within the financial statements.
Disclosure of the gross values has been included in note 18 of the financialstatements.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of theinstrument.
77 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of the exposure to floating interest ratefluctuations.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedgeditems.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculativepurposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which theyarise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortisedcost.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of itsliabilities.
Investments Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transactioncosts.
Investments are classified as either held-to-maturity, held-for-trading, loans and receivables or available-for-sale.
Held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Held-for-trading and available-for-sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for theperiod.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified asequity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new Ordinary Shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from theproceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such Ordinary Shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equityholders.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision-maker CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the ExecutiveBoard.
78 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Review Report of the Directors Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for therestructuring that has been communicated to affectedparties.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised oncepaid.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events.
Estimates and accounting judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under thecircumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, bydefinition, differ from the actual results.
The assumptions and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment tothecarrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are asfollows: Accounting for intangible assets The Group records all intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination at fair value.
Intangible assets are deemed to have indefinite lives and as such are not amortised but are subject, as a minimum, to annual tests for impairment.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount through calculating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of key estimate andsensitivities or key assumptions are discussed in note10.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates retirement benefit schemes in the United Kingdom and for most overseas countries in which it carries on business.
Those in the United Kingdom are defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes: overseas schemes vary in detail depending onlocal practice.
The UK defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May2008.
The Group accounts for the defined benefit-scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The deficit surplus of the defined benefit pension schemes is recognised in full on the balance sheet and represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation is carried out at least every three years and the defined benefit obligation surplus is updated on an annual basis, by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method which utilises key judgemental assumptions.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits willbepaid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
In countries where there isnodeep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds areused.
Pension charges income recognised in the income statement consists of administration charges of the scheme and a cost based on the interest income on net pension scheme liabilities surpluses calculated in accordance with IAS19.
Differences between the actual return on assets and interest income, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are included directly in the Groups statement of comprehensiveincome.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they falldue.
Current tax provisions The current tax provision directly relates to the actual tax payable on the Groups profits and is determined based on tax laws and regulations that differ across the numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Assumptions and judgements are made in applying these laws to the taxable profits in any given period in order to calculate the tax charge for that period.
Where the eventual tax paid or reclaimed is different to the amounts originally estimated, the difference will be charged or credited to the income statement in the period in which it isdetermined.
Segmental analysis The Chief Operating Decision-Maker CODM has been identified as the Executive Board which comprises the three ExecutiveDirectors.
The CODM reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports which include an allocation of central revenue and costs asappropriate.
The CODM considers the business from a geographic perspective, with Africa, Asia and Europe being the reporting segments.
The CODM assesses the performance based on operating profit before any exceptional items.
Other information provided, except as noted below, tothe CODM is measured in a manner consistent with that of the financialstatements.
Sales between segments are carried out on an arms lengthbasis.

Other intangible assets include the Groups acquired brands which are deemed to have indefinitelives.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, which all have indefinite useful lives, are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indicators ofimpairment.
The methods used is asfollows: Intangible assets including goodwill are allocated to the appropriate cash-generating units CGUs based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows independently in relation to the specific intangible goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations that use cash flow projections from approved budgets and plans over a period of five years.
Key assumptions in the budgets and plans include future revenue volume price growth rates, associated future levels of marketing support, cost-base of manufacture and supply and directly associated overheads and tax.
These assumptions are based on historical trends and future market expectations.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of 2.5% 2013: 3%.
Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual CGU, using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group as the base discount rate, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.
Due to the similar geographic and product diversification of their respective markets and risks associated with each CGU, a pre-tax discount rate of 8.8% was deemed appropriate for all reviewedCGUs.
The net book value of goodwill and other intangible assets by CGUs is asfollows: Other Other intangible intangible Goodwill Goodwill assets assets 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m Original Source 9.8 9.8 Beauty Division brands 40.4 40.4 188.2 188.2 Raffertys Garden 39.2 Other 5.4 5.4 4.7 4.9 Total 45.8 45.8 241.9 202.9 A sensitivity analysis has been performed around the base assumptions with the conclusion that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets to be less than the carryingvalue.

Financial liabilities and assets, derivative financial instruments and financial risk management a Financial instrument fair value estimation The Group holds a number of financial instruments that are either held at fair value or historic cost within the annual report andaccounts.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial instruments utilised by the Group during the years ended 31 May 2014 and 31 May 2013, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised asfollows: Current and non-current investments In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Groups balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted marketprices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their bookvalues.
Borrowings and cash The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately inthe incomestatement.
In deriving the fair value the derivative instruments are classified as level 1, 2 or 3 depending on the valuation method applied in determining their fairvalue.
The different levels have been defined asfollows: LEVEL 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs The only financial instruments held at fair value by the Group relate to foreign currency forward contracts used as derivatives for hedging and interest rate swaps on a portion of the Groups long term borrowings.
These financial instruments are level 2 financial instruments forallperiods and there have been no transfers between either level 1 and 2 or level 2 and 3 in anyperiod.

These are fair valued as level 2 derivative financial instruments.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have been fair valued using exchange rates that are quoted in an active market.
The effects of discounting are generally insignificant for Level 2 derivatives.
The Group holds a cancellable interest rate swap over the amortising term loan and the fair value is immaterial at year-end.

The net notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 May 2014 were 49.9 million 2013:26.7million.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next12 months.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 May 2014 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
This is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain or loss is included in the initial amount recognised for the purchase of fixed assets, in which case recognition is over the lifetime of theasset.

Financial liabilities and assets, financial instruments and financial risk management continued d Financial risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity and interest rates.
The Groups treasury function reports to the Board at least annually with reference to the application of the Group treasury policy.
The policy addresses issues of liquidity, funding and investment as well as interest rate, currency and commodityrisks.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date systems.
The Group modifies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets and products.
The Group Risk Committee, under authority delegated by the Board, formulates the high level Group risk management policy, monitors risk and receives reports that allow it to review the effectiveness oftheGroups risk managementpolicies.
i Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
TheGroup has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks.
Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating and equity price reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
As an example the Groups borrowings are arranged with a syndicate of major banks and are committed until 2016.
An analysis of the international long-term credit ratings of counterparties where cash and cash equivalents are held is asfollows: 2014 2013 m m AA 16.0 14.1 A 22.5 23.9 B 26.5 55.0 C 5.0 Total 70.0 93.0 The short-term deposit with joint ventures which does not form part of cash and cash equivalents of 18.8 million 2013: 10.1 million isarepayable on-demand balance, split between Nutricima Limited 5.2 million 2013: 4.8 million and PZ Wilmar Limited 13.6 million 2013: 5.3 million, both joint venture companies.
The balance earns interest at a rate of 13% 2013:13%.
ii Liquidity management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains a strong liquidity position and manages the liquidity profile of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cash flows are appropriately balanced and all funding obligations are met when due.
iii Market risk management Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, cashflow, interest rates and commodity prices will reduce the Groups income.
The management of market risk is undertaken by the operating unit Finance Directors under delegated authority using risk limits approved by the Board.
iv Foreign exchange risk management The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Subsidiary undertakings must ensure that all transactional exposures arising from commitments in a currency other than their functional currency are identified and monitored.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts where possible to manage theseexposures.

Financial liabilities and assets, financial instruments and financial risk management continued The below sensitivity analysis was conducted by modelling a 10% weakening based on average annual fluctuations of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 May which would have increased equity and increased decreased profit loss by the following amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remainconstant.

v Price risk management Due to the nature of the business, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group does take measures to protect against shortterm impacts of these fluctuations, however, failure to recover higher costs could have a negative impact on profits.
vi Cash flow and interest rate risk The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
The Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps.
vii Contractual undiscounted cashflows The Groups only contracted financial liabilities are the amortising term loan of 26 million as at 31 May 2014.
The contracted undiscounted cashflows of the amortising term loan total 26.75 m as at 31 May 2014 2013: 47.25million.
