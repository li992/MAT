Therefore the expected duration for settlement of the UDS is not defined.
This note shows the movements in the UDS during the year.

These have mainly been caused by the significant appreciation of assets due to the fall in Eurozone government and corporate bond yields during the year.
Negative UDS balances result from an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
Any negative balances are tested for recoverability using embedded value methodology and in line with local accounting practice.
Testing is conducted at a participating fund-level within each life entity.
Following the reversal of previous losses, all Italian participating funds at 31 December 2014 had positive UDS balances with the exception of one very small fund.
The method for estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance uses a real-world embedded value method, with a risk-discount rate of 5.00% 2013: 6.60%.
The embedded value method includes an implicit allowance for the time value of options and guarantees.
The negative UDS balance in Italy was tested for recoverability and 0.1 million of negative UDS was considered irrecoverable 2013: 42 million, of which 39 million was for Eurovita.
Following this there are no longer any negative UDS balances in Italy at 31 December 2014.
The total UDS balance in Italy was 953 million positive at 31 December 2014 2013: 205 million positive.
In Spain, all participating funds had positive UDS balances at 31 December 2014, and consequently testing of negative UDS was not required.
The carrying value of UDS was 248 million positive 2013: 132 million positive.
