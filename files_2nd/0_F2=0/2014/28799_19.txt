Changes in Accounting Policies i IFRS 10 Investment Entities From 1 January 2014 entities that meet the denition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment related activities continue to be consolidated.
The criteria which define an investment entity are as follows: an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services: an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
The Groups annual and interim Report and Accounts clearly state its corporate objective of investing for the purpose of generating long-term capital growth.

Its principal effect is to increase the line item Investments held at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A further consequence is that intercompany balances between the parent and these subsidiaries, and also between these subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that remain consolidated, are no longer eliminated which means there is a corresponding increase in the line item Other payables.
There are also minor changes to other balance sheet items.
However there is no change to the net asset value.
This change in accounting treatment has been applied retrospectively with effect from 1 January 2013 as to go back further is impracticable.
The changes are shown below: Consolidated Balance Sheet Extracts 1 January 2013 As previously IFRS 10 1 January 2013 disclosed adjustments Restated million million million Investments held at fair value 1,801.4 142.5 1,943.9 Other payables 5.9 140.9 146.8 Cash at bank 66.4 1.3 65.1 Other receivables 25.6 0.4 25.2 Tax payable 0.2 0.2 Deferred tax asset 2.7 0.1 2.6 Other assets & liabilities 42.8 42.8 Net assets 1,847.2 1,847.2 Net asset value per ordinary share 1,192p 1,192p 31 December 2013 31 December As previously IFRS 10 2013 disclosed adjustments Restated million million million Investments held at fair value 2,112.5 112.4 2,224.9 Other payables 6.2 111.2 117.4 Cash at bank 51.6 0.6 51.0 Other receivables 111.4 0.5 110.9 Tax payable 0.2 0.2 Property, plant and equipment 0.4 0.1 0.3 Deferred tax asset 1.2 0.2 1.0 Other assets & liabilities 124.7 124.7 Net assets 2,146.0 2,146.0 Net asset value per ordinary share 1,385p 1,385p 64 Report and Accounts December 2014 RIT Capital Partners plc | Company Highlights | Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information | 234436 RIT R&A pp058-pp067 26 02 2015 08:41 Page 65 Group and Parent Company Accounting Policies Consolidated Income Statement By holding certain subsidiaries at fair value, as opposed to consolidating them, the line by line contribution they previously made to the Consolidated Income Statement is removed and replaced by a corresponding amendment to Gains losses on portfolio investments held at fair value.
As mentioned previously, intercompany transactions with these subsidiaries are also no longer eliminated.
This line by line restatement is shown below.

For the year ended 31 December 2013 Cash inflow outflow before taxation and interest decreases by 0.1m, Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year decreases by 0.5m and Cash and cash equivalents at the year end decreases by 0.6m.
These changes all reflect the exclusion of cash movements in, and year-end cash balances of the previously consolidated subsidiaries.
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity For the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity only two line items changed following restatement.
The movement on the Capital Reserve for the year ended 31 December 2013 is increased by 0.7m resulting in a balance at 31 December 2013 of 1,915.2m.
A corresponding reduction of 0.7m in the movement in the Revenue Reserve also occurs resulting in a Revenue Reserve balance of 22.1m at 31 December 2013. ii International Accounting Standard 16 Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 16 Prior to 31 December 2014 the Group treated Spencer House as an investment property.
Following discussion at the Audit and Risk Committee it was decided that the most appropriate treatment is to continue to treat a portion of the property as investment property consistent with IAS 40 and the occupied remainder as property, plant and equipment consistent with IAS 16.
The resulting restatement has no effect on NAV but reduces earnings per share EPS.
The Group restatement for those line items that are affected is shown below.
In order to aid referencing with the previous IFRS 10 restatement, the figures follow on from the restated figures above i. e. they already reflect the IFRS 10 changes.
The quantum of restatement for the Company as a solo entity is identical to that of the Group.

The movement on the Revenue Reserve for the year ended 31 December 2013 is reduced by 1.0 million resulting in a Revenue Reserve balance of 21.1 million.
