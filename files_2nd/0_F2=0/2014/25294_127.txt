SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
Impairment On a quarterly basis the Investment Committee reviews each asset in the Groups portfolio.
Assets which are underperforming or which the Committee wishes to receive regular updates on are added to the watch list.
During the quarterly review the Committee will identify any impairment events and subsequently determine the level of impairment required.
Typical impairment events include, but are not limited to, non payment of cash interest, deterioration in trading or a restructuring.
Impairment losses are recognised as the difference between the carrying value of the investment and the discounted value of managements best estimates of future cash flow.
These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those initially recognised in the financial statements.
Effective interest rate The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows, including agency and arranging fees, over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The expected life of an asset is estimated by the relevant Investment Executive using knowledge gained from close monitoring of the investment and, where applicable, their presence on the Board.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle a current legal or constructive obligation, which has arisen as a result of a past event, and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The Groups onerous contract provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the ongoing cost of the contract and its expected termination cost.
The Groups contingent liabilities include potential amounts, if any, for legal claims arising in the course of business.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
There are systems of controls in place to create an acceptable balance between the potential costs, should such a risk occur, and the cost of managing those risks.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: market risk liquidity risk credit risk This section provides details of the Groups approach to financial risks and describes the methods used by the Board to mitigate and control such risk.
