Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of fixed assets and in accordance with applicable UK Law and Accounting Standards UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts.
They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted, and on a going concern basis.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to their circumstances.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the Income Statement.
Expenses are charged against revenue except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to the capital account in the Income Statement: expenses are treated as a capital item in the Income Statement and ultimately recognised in the capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to the capital reserve to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
The performance fee has been charged 100% to the capital reserve, as the fee will have arisen wholly or predominantly by virtue of the capital performance of the investments.
d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Income Statement on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.
e Investments All investments have been designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.
This is done because all investments are considered to form part of a group of financial assets which is evaluated on a fair Murray International Trust PLC 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued value basis, in accordance with the Companys documented investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are treated in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 30% to revenue and 70% to capital in the Income Statement to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as a gain or loss to capital or revenue within the Income Statement depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
h Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value based on an appropriate model.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement under Losses gains on investments.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

Risk management The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
i Market risk The fair value and future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rate movements will affect: the fair value of the investments in fixed interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the values of the fixed interest rate securities.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving, and uncommitted facilities.
The fixed rate facilities are used to finance opportunities at low rates and, the revolving and uncommitted facilities to provide flexibility in the short-term.
Current bank covenant guidelines state that the total borrowings will not exceed 40% of the adjusted net tangible assets of the Company.

Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above tables.
Forward currency contracts are measured at fair value.
Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
There is no interest rate risk exposure from derivative instruments.
58 Murray International Trust PLC If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower based on current parameter used by the Managers Investment Risk Department on risk assessment and all other variables were held constant, the Companys: revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2014 would increase decrease by 177,000 2013 increase decrease by 45,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
These figures have been calculated based on cash positions at each year end.
equity reserves would increase decrease by 1,632,000 2013 increase decrease by 4,381,000.
This is also mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on cash balances and its fixed interest portfolio.
These figures have been calculated based on cash and fixed interest portfolio positions at each year end.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the interest rate risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
The risk parameters used will also fluctuate depending on the current market perception.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Management of the risk It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A significant proportion of the Companys borrowings, as detailed in note 13, is in foreign currency as at 31 December 2014.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign currency movements.
At 31 December 2014 the Company had a foreign currency contract, details of which are disclosed on page 61.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% decrease in the context of a 10% increase the figures below should all be read as negative in sterling against the major foreign currencies in which the Company has exposure based on exposure 5% of total exposure and excludes foreign exchange contracts due to the reason their being entered into is to mitigate foreign currency risk.
The sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

Price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
The Companys stated objective is to achieve a total return greater than its benchmark by investing predominantly in equities worldwide.
Management of the risk It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 65, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Balance Sheet date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2014 would have increased decreased by 140,833,000 2013 increase decrease of 142,128,000 and equity reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities as they fall due in line with the maturity profile analysed below.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 13. iii Credit risk This is failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk where the Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit ratings of the issuer are taken into account so as to manage the risk to the Company of default: investments in quoted bonds are made across a variety of industry sectors and geographic markets so as to avoid concentrations of credit risk: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the daily review of failed trade reports.
In addition, both stock and cash reconciliations to the custodians records are performed daily to ensure discrepancies are investigated in a timely manner.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee: cash is held only with reputable banks with acceptable credit quality.
It is the Managers policy to trade only with Aand above Long Term rated and A-1 P-1 Short Term rated counterparties.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Balance Sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2014 was as follows: 62 Murray International Trust PLC 2014 2013 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Non-current assets Securities at fair value through profit or loss 1,408,332 1,408,332 1,421,277 1,421,277 Current assets Current taxation 1,265 1,265 1,121 1,121 Other debtors 96 96 53 53 Accrued income 6,654 6,654 5,653 5,653 Cash and short term deposits 17,766 17,766 4,535 4,535 1,434,113 1,434,113 1,432,639 1,432,639 None of the Companys financial assets is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at 190,821,000 as at 31 December 2014 2013 195,401,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 188,642,000 2013 190,807,000 note 13.
The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrowers margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency.
The carrying value of all other assets and liabilities is an approximation of fair value.
Fair value hierarchy FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31 December 2014 Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 1,225,696 1,225,696 Quoted preference shares a 6,566 6,566 Quoted bonds b 144,106 31,964 176,070 Total 1,376,368 31,964 1,408,332 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Foreign exchange forward contracts c 370 370 Net fair value 1,376,368 31,594 1,407,962 Murray International Trust PLC 63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31 December 2013 Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 1,318,859 1,318,859 Quoted preference shares a 5,900 5,900 Quoted bonds b 96,518 96,518 Total 1,421,277 1,421,277 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Foreign exchange forward contracts c 2,413 2,413 Net fair value 1,421,277 2,413 1,418,864 a Quoted equities and preference shares The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted equities and preference shares has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.

b Quoted bonds The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted bonds has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
Bonds included in Fair Value Levels 1 and 2 include Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds.
Of the investments categorised as Level 2, one with a fair value of 10,800,000 2013 10,133,000 has been recategorised from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year due to concern over its liquidity.
