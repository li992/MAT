In the event that AllBlue changes its investment policy without Shareholder approval, the Directors will consider removing the Companys assets from AllBlue or taking other appropriate action so that the Company is not in breach of any applicable regulation.
83 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Company Information AllBlue Limited AllBlue is a fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands with an investment objective to provide consistent long-term appreciation of its assets through investment in a diversified portfolio of underlying funds.
Investors in the Company are therefore offered an opportunity to participate indirectly in the same investment portfolio as that of AllBlue.
AllBlue seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in underlying funds, each of which on its own has a distinct investment objective and approach and which, as part of a portfolio of assets, form a diversified basket of hedge fund investments.
As at 31 December 2014, AllBlue was invested in seven underlying funds comprising BlueCrest Capital International Limited, BlueCrest Emerging Markets Fund Limited, BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit Fund Limited, BlueCrest Mercantile Fund Limited, BlueCrest Equity Strategies Fund Limited, BlueTrend Fund Limited and BlueCrest Quantitative Equity Fund Limited together, including the master funds into which such funds invest, the Underlying Funds, all of which were managed by BlueCrest Capital Management Limited BCML acting in its capacity as general partner of BlueCrest Capital Management LP.
AllBlue may in the future exclude any or all of these funds or from time to time include any other investment fund established by BCML or by managers with close links to BCML.
BCML is the appointed investment manager of AllBlue.
BCML has appointed on behalf of AllBlue, acting as its agent, certain members of the BlueCrest group AllBlue Sub-Investment Managers as subinvestment managers to manage the assets of AllBlue, as agents of AllBlue.
The AllBlue SubInvestment Managers seek to construct a portfolio of investments for AllBlue, comprising the Underlying Funds, by utilising proprietary optimisation techniques as well as an in-depth understanding of underlying positions, correlations and risks.
Both allocations and risks are closely monitored on a monthly basis by the AllBlue Sub-Investment Managers AllBlue committee, comprising a team of senior investment professionals of the AllBlue Sub-Investment Managers.
On a monthly basis the AllBlue Sub-Investment Managers AllBlue Committee also reviews the allocation of AllBlues assets amongst the Underlying Funds and makes such adjustments as it deems appropriate.
It is the policy of the AllBlue Sub-Investment Managers that the assets of AllBlue will be predominantly fully invested.
However, AllBlue may from time to time hold certain assets in cash or cash equivalents, should it consider that this is required for efficient portfolio management or otherwise in the best interests of AllBlue.
84 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Company Information AllBlue Leveraged Feeder Limited The Company holds a cash reserve the Cash Reserve for the purposes of managing day-to-day cash flows, for meeting expenses of the Company and for funding any repurchases of Shares.
In order to maintain a substantially similar economic exposure to that of AllBlue, the Company invests an appropriate amount into shares in AllBlue Leveraged.
AllBlue Leveraged invests all of its assets in the ordinary shares of AllBlue but with the addition of leverage of approximately 100 per cent.
of its net asset value 50 per cent prior to 1 January 2015, giving investment exposure which is approximately twice 1.5 times prior to 1 January 2015 that of AllBlue excluding all fees and expenses attributable to such investments.
The effect of these arrangements is that the Company's aggregate investment exposure to AllBlue is broadly 100% whilst providing access to more immediate liquidity.
The Cash Reserve and AllBlue Leveraged investment are held solely within the Sterling class, but so that the Cash Reserve remains available for use by the US Dollar class as well, if needed.
The Board reviews the Cash Reserve on a quarterly basis to ensure it is adequate for the Companys anticipated needs and that a broadly 100% exposure to AllBlue is maintained.
Borrowing and Leverage Although the Company has power under its Articles of Incorporation to borrow up to an amount equal to 10 per cent of its net assets at the time of the drawing, the Directors do not intend that the Company should engage directly in any structural borrowing and any such borrowing would only be for the purpose of managing day-to-day cash flow, for meeting expenses of the Company or for funding repurchases of Shares.
AllBlue does not employ any leverage but may be exposed to it in the Underlying Funds and may engage in short term borrowing, as is deemed necessary from time to time, pending the availability of subscription monies, to fund new allocations to the Underlying Funds, or in order to fund redemptions ahead of redemption proceeds from the Underlying Funds being made available.
AllBlue Leveraged employs leverage for the purpose of making investments.
Whilst there is no limit on the extent of borrowings or leverage that AllBlue Leveraged may employ it is expected to be in an amount equal to approximately 100 per cent.
of the AllBlue Leveraged net asset value, but may vary from time to time.
Prior to 1 January 2014 this was 50 per cent.
85 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Company Information None of the Underlying Funds are subject to any limits on the extent to which borrowings or leverage may be employed and they may leverage through the use of borrowings, options, futures, options on futures, swaps and other synthetic or derivative financial instruments.
