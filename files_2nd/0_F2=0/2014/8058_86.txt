Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment.
Payments made in respect of acquired distribution rights are capitalized when it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company.
The useful life of the acquired distribution rights is determined based on legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other relevant factors.
Acquired rights with finite lives are subsequently amortized using the straight-line method over their defined useful economic lives.
Amortization expense related to acquired distribution rights is included in selling, distribution and administrative expenses.
Payments related to the acquisition of rights to a product or technology are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits from the asset will flow to the Company.
Amortization of the asset starts when it becomes available for use, at which point the asset is amortized over its useful economic life.
Prior to that date, the intangible asset is tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether any indication of impairment exists.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment either annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired depending on the intangible asset type.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.
