Profit and loss As permitted by the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, principally as follows: Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The expected return on the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the year and the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes are included within other finance charges income.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses in the year together with differences from changes in assumptions.
The deficit on defined benefit pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as the pension liability.
The accounts include pension schemes where the parent company is the principal employer.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more tax subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised.
b Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Laird PLC 156 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the financial statements of parent company continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference tomarket values for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss account.
Share based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss account relates to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP and Restricted Share Plan RSP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For grants that ultimately do not vest, charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date ofcancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.

Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report Laird PLC 160 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the financial statements of parent company continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 10 Pension schemes continued Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates of return from the main asset classes.
For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in the markets for these assets has been assumed.
For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the 2014 year end and 2013 year end is based on the SAPS all lives tables with a 90% multiplier for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each members year of birth.
Allowance is made for improvements in line with CMI 2011 projections with a 1.5% pa long term trend from2002.
The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 2013 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime ofaparticipant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables: Executive and director Other members members Age Males Females Males Females 65 22.1 24.4 23.9 26.1 65 in 15 years 23.7 26.2 25.5 27.9 For FRS 17 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 3.2% per annum 2013, 3.6%, salary increases of 4.2% 5.2% per annum 2013, 4.6% 5.6% and a discount rate for liabilities of 3.6% per annum 2013, 4.4%.

Laird PLC 163 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 14 Share based payments The Directors remuneration report on pages 64 to 95, sets out the general terms and conditions for long term incentives and the vesting requirements for the 2014 awards.
Performance Conditions for awards made in 2012 under the LTIP and Option Plan Performance conditions are measured over a single three year period and there is no provision for re-testing therefore the awards lapse if the performance targets are not met.
Two measures were used to determine the extent to which awards made in 2012 would vest: achievement of a Total Shareholder Return TSR target and an underlying Earnings Per Share EPS target.
For LTIP awards made in 2012, 75% is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25% is based on achievement of the EPS target.
For awards under the Option Plan, 75% is based on EPS and 25% on TSR.
The EPS and TSR conditions are set out below.
TSR condition For 2012 a list of 20 companies was selected as the comparator group to be used for these purposes: Ampenol Invensys Sanmina TT Electronics AVX Meggitt Senior TTM Technologies Bodycote Molex Smiths Group Ultra Electronics CSR Morgan Crucible Spectris Vishay Intertechnology E2V Technologies Oxford Instruments Spirent Communications Wolfson Microelectronics The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the LTIP: 25% of the award under the Option Plan is dependent on Lairds relative TSR performance over three years against this group of companies, as follows: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting for Performance Level TSR Measure % Upper Quartile Full Vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro-rata between 30% and full Vesting Below Median Nil EPS condition The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the Option Plan: 25% of the award under the LTIP is dependent on Lairds EPS performance for the 2014 financial year, as follows: Level of vesting in 2015 for EPS Measure Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual Growth in Continuing Earnings per share Threshold 30% vesting RPI 5% p. a Full vesting RPI 10% p. a There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between the above two targets.

Market Value Options will vest based on the average annual growth in the Companys Earnings Per Share over a three year period in line with the following performance schedule: Average Annual Growth in Continuing Level of market value option vesting Earnings per share 13% p. a.
Full vesting Between 8% p. a. and 13% p. a.
Pro-rata between 25% and full vesting 8% p. a.

Shares awarded under the Medium Term Incentive Plan MTIP, vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, provided the employee is still employed by the Group.
There are vesting conditions attached to the MTIP awards which specify profit and EPS targets for the years to December 2012 and 2013.
Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan RSP vest three years after they have been awarded to the employee at nil cost, provided the employee is still employed by the Group.
All share based payments are equity settled.
An expense of 1.8m was recognised in the year 2013, 1.4m before employers national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards in issue at the beginning of the year, end of the year and those granted during the year.

The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this istaken into account in calculating the fair value.
