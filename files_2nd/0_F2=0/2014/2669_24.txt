104 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Groups full year financial statements.
The consolidated and Company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies accounts Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 as amended.
The financial statements are presented in Euros and rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Adoption of new and revised Standards and Interpretations The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no effect on its consolidated results or financial position: IAS 27 Amended Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Amended Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IAS 36 Amended Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January2014 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB or the IFRIC before the period end but are as yet not effective for the 2014 year end: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 Not yet endorsed by the EU Original standards have been endorsed, further amendments to the standards are yet to be endorsed The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of, and recognition in its consolidated results in future periods.
Basis of accounting The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments which are held at their fair value.

Accounting policies continued Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows: Revenue recognition note 1 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 10 Regulatory compliance, litigation, provisions and contingent liabilities note 24 Acquisition accounting and value of acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration payable note 27 Tax including deferred tax notes 8 and 22 Contingent consideration receivable and payable notes 15 and 18 Basis of consolidation Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in bwin.
party holdings Limited formerly PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, bwin.
party Holdings Limited formerly PartyGaming Holdings Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Accounting for subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company.
The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholders share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost, less any impairment in value.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an  basis.
106 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued Investments Investments include investments in associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments.
Available-for-sale investments Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
In accordance with IAS39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for postacquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Investments in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control: that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in that investment are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Intangible assets Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired in the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
Identifiable assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 107 1.
Accounting policies continued Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete their development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Licence costs Expenditure incurred in order to obtain gaming licences is capitalised and amortised over the life of the licence.
Amortisation of intangible assets Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, over the periods the Group expects to benefit from their use, and varies between: Brand and domain names 5% to 20% per annum Capitalised development expenditure 20% to 33% per annum Contractual relationships over the length of the contract Customer lists and contracts 5% to 50% per annum Intellectual property and gaming licences over the length of the licence Software 20% to 33% per annum Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment At the end of each reporting year, an impairment review of goodwill is completed.
In addition, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land which is stated at cost and not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
108 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold land, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Segment information An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses.
Each segments operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
During 2014 the Group reviewed financial statements presented by product type which were supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment during the current and the prior year.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising sports betting, casino & games, poker, bingo, and network services third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees.
Sports betting, casino & games and bingo net gaming revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions, certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Poker net gaming revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament less certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, third-party payment services, sale of domain names, financial markets, software services and fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions.
Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of betting and gaming taxes and broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable lifecycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current years revenue to the estimated remaining total revenues.
Clean EBITDA Clean EBITDA is the Groups measure of reporting performance and is EBITDA adjusted for exchange differences, reorganisation expenses, income or expenses that relate to exceptional items and non-cash charges relating to impairments and share-based payments.
Exceptional items are those items the Group considers to be non-recurring or material in nature that may distort an understanding of financial performance or impair comparability.
Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 109 1.
Accounting policies continued On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Euros at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity the currency reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of Group entities separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items, forming part of the Groups net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The financial statements were translated into Euros at the following rates: 31-Dec-14 Average 2014 31-Dec-13 Average 2013 Argentinean Pesos ARS 0.0975 0.0940 0.1113 0.1367 British Pound GBP 1.2870 1.2437 1.2031 1.1766 Bulgarian Lev BGN 0.5109 0.5111 0.5113 0.5113 Indian Rupees INR 0.0131 0.0124 0.0117 0.0128 Israeli Shekel ILS 0.2116 0.2108 0.2094 0.2087 Swedish Kronas SEK 0.1058 0.1100 0.1129 0.1155 Ukraine Hryvnia UAH 0.0522 0.0656 0.0881 0.0934 US Dollar USD 0.8257 0.7582 0.7259 0.7516 Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
110 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a sharebased payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Own shares Own shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company.
The cash cost of own shares creates an own share reserve.
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based on proceeds less weighted-average cost of shares initially purchased now exercised.
The cost of own shares repurchased in cash as part of the share buy-back programme is debited to reserves.
The shares are cancelled at nominal value with a corresponding entry taken to the capital redemption reserve.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 111 1.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and those measured at fair value through profit & loss.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered to be restricted cash.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments is included in respect of foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group.
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, which are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months orless.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
112 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, during 2014 the Groups operations were segmented into the following reporting segments which reflect the Groups reporting of results to the Chief Operating Decision Makers CODMs : sports betting, casino & games, poker, bingo and other The segment other includes a number of businesses that in aggregate are not large enough to account for more than 10% of the Groups revenues, Clean EBITDA or assets.
Included within this segment are: World Poker Tour: the third-party payment processing business, Kalixa: the financial spreadbetting business, InterTrader: software services, social gaming, profit on domain sales and the Winners retail business.
Under the Groups basis of segmental reporting, a high proportion of costs are allocated directly to each segment, and the remaining central costs are allocated pro rata to gross profit.
Certain product verticals are dependent on the cross-sell of players from other product verticals and thus includes a reallocation of marketing costs between these verticals in order to more accurately reflect the true profitability of that segment on a standalone basis.
Unallocated corporate expenses are allocated to each of these operating segments.
The measure of reporting segment performance is Clean EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this was the same as for the Group accounts.
This measure will continue to be the case in future periods.
These segments were the basis upon which the Group reported its segments in 2014.
As from 1 January 2015 the Group will change its basis of internal and external segmental reporting to a label-led structure.

In 2014 the effect of non-taxable income primarily represents IFRS required adjustments to deferred consideration see note 27 whilst in 2013 it represented the release of the fair value provision see note 20.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The Groups policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered.
At the year end there were Group companies registered in 23 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial information.
Factors that may affect future tax charges As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles.

The fair value of customer lists from existing customers takes into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
Licences are amortised over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.

A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 2014 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets.
The recoverable amounts of all the above CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets and long-range forecasts.
These budgets and forecasts assume the underlying business models will continue to operate on a comparable basis under the current regulatory and taxation regimes, adjusted for any known changes.
Sports The recoverable amount of the Sports CGU of 350.0m has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following ten year period.
The Group believes that going beyond five years cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established business and is a market leader in a growth industry.
Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in the light of anticipated economic and market conditions.
Discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The table below shows what the effect of changes in the key assumptions would have on the recoverable amount.

Assets and liabilities held for sale In accordance with the Groups focus on disposing of non-core activities, the Group has classified certain of its non-core assets as held-for-sale.
Following the decision to classify as held-for-sale, the Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the business groups included within this category and an impairment charge of 5.3m has been made against certain business groups.
The Directors now believe that the carrying value of the holdings represents the lower of cost and the current fair value of each of the business groups held for sale.
The Group is exploring various options with respect to the various non-core assets but believes that external sales represent the most likely option for the disposal groups included and the Group anticipates that these sales will likely complete by the end of 2015.

The Group had a joint venture agreement with Nordeus LLC to develop, market, distribute and publish a social betting platform and loaned the joint venture company 1m to develop the software platform.
In 2014, in line with the Groups policy to concentrate on its core business, the Group exited from its future commitments with respect to Nordeus WIN Gibraltar Limited and impaired the loan investment accordingly.
Circulo Payment Limited is a new venture launched in 2014 with Millicom International Cellular S. A. to develop a payment service provider to operate in Latin America and Africa.
This entity was set up in 2014 and the Group has contributed 0.4m of investment into this business.
Other joint ventures included Conspo Sportcontent GmbH which repaid the final 2m of the loan which the Group had advanced.
This investment was then transferred into assets held-for-sale as part of the review of non-core investments see note 13.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments primarily relate to the Groups interests in several early stage digital entertainment investment funds.
Investments are held in Wave Crest Holdings Limited, a payment processing company, and various gaming and non-gaming investment funds including New Game Capital LP and Axon Capital ICT Funds and Aldorino Trust, an investment trust.
The value of overall investments fell by 1.8m 2013: loss of 4.8m, principally as a result of an impairment charge of 2.2m against the full carrying value of Wave Crest Holdings Limited partially offset by an additional investment of 0.4m in a further investment fund.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the investments approximates to their fair values or estimates of the present value of expected future cashflows.
Company The Company holds the Groups investment in the Aldorino Trust which was revalued during the period and acquired a 0.4m investment in the Axon Capital ICT Funds.

Provisions Following the successful settlement of an outstanding dispute, 83.8m of a fair value provision created at the time of the Merger was written-back during 2013.
The settlement agreed was for 1.9m resulting in a write-back of 83.8m to the statement of comprehensive income and a transfer tocreditors of 1.9m.
During 2013 there was also an agreement reached to settle claims from the state of Kentucky for 11.9m which was paid in thatyear.
Onerous contracts related to provisions made against the future costs of contracts where subsequent changes in legislation in certain countries meant that the future economic benefits received by the Group were less than the costs involved with fulfilling the remaining terms and conditions of the contracts and were recognised at the Directors best estimate based on their knowledge of the markets of the countries involved.
4.2m in respect of this provision was brought forward from 1 January 2013 and was fully utilised in that year.
The amounts due for provisions are recognised at fair value based on the above and carried at the best estimate of the provision discounted for the time value of money.

If such taxes are levied, either on the basis of current law or the current practice of any tax authority, or by reason of a change in the law or practice, then this may have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group or on its financial position.
Where it is considered probable that a previously identified contingent liability will give rise to an actual outflow of funds, then a provision is made in respect of the relevant jurisdiction and period impacted.
Where the likelihood of a liability arising is considered remote, or the possible contingency is not material to the financial position of the Group, the contingency is not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Litigation Given the lack of a harmonised regulatory environment for online gaming in Europe, a number of civil and administrative proceedings are pending against the Group and or its board members in several countries including but not limited to Germany, Portugal and Spain aimed at preventing bwin.
party from offering its services in these countries.
Further, there are criminal proceedings pending against a current and former board member for the alleged violation of local gaming laws in France.
On 16 October 2014, the Portuguese Supreme Court confirmed a ruling of the Oporto Court of First Instance of September 2011 against Liga Portuguesa fide Futebol Profissional Liga, bwin.
party digital entertainment plc and bwin.
party services Gibraltar Ltd bwin.
In this ruling the First Instance Court had i declared the already terminated sponsorship agreement between bwin.

Following the first instance ruling, the Liga and bwin.
party already took measures in order to comply with the decision.
However, it cannot be ruled out that certain activities may still be considered as being in violation of the ruling.
party are of the view that the courts have interpreted Portuguese rules on advertising in breach of the Portuguese Constitution, the Liga and bwin.
party filed an appeal to the Portuguese Constitutional Court on 3 November 2014, which is currently pending.
In June 2012, APC initiated enforcement proceedings against the Liga and bwin.
party, requesting the payment of pecuniary sanctions in the total amount of 6.35 million for the alleged violation of the First Instance Court judgment during the period between 24 September 2011 and 31 January 2012.
party remain firmly of the view that such enforcement action is formally incorrect and without merit.
In June 2012, the Oporto Enforcement Court dismissed APCs enforcement claim for lack of enforceability.
APC filed an appeal against this decision, which the Second Instance Enforcement Court granted on 25 November 2014 and decided that pecuniary sanctions were enforceable at the time APC initiated the enforcement proceeding without assessing the enforcement case on its merits.
party submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court on 12 January 2015, which is currently pending.
Despite the appeal pending at the Supreme Court merely on the formal question of enforceability, the enforcement proceedings will continue before the Oporto Enforcement Court, where the Liga and bwin.
party will be requested to submit their comprehensive defence arguments.

Contingent liabilities continued In July 2012, the Spanish gaming operator, Codere, filed an unfair competition complaint against various bwin.
Prior to this complaint, the Spanish Court rejected Coderes request for a preliminary injunction.
The complaint filed by Codere seeks damages and prejudicial consequences in the amount of approximately 25m.
On 10 July 2014, the Court issued the ruling dismissing Coderes claim and all of its petitions.
On 16 October 2014, Codere filed an appeal against the ruling of first instance.

No provision has been made for contingent liabilities relating to the above detailed claims.
In 2007, bwin Argentina S. A. bwin Argentina filed an amparo complaint protective order requesting extraordinary constitutional protection to operate its licence granted by the gaming regulatory authority of the Province of Misiones in case of any threat or act from any specific third parties.
On 26 June 2012, the court rejected the amparo complaint.
Following a final decision against bwin Argentina with regard to requesting constitutional protection to operate its licence granted in the Province of Misiones, bwin Argentina must bear all costs of the proceedings including fees of the counsels to the prevailing parties.
As a result of various freezing orders, BBVA Banco Francs has frozen ARS 5,000,000 approximately 0.5m and Banco Hipotecario has frozen ARS5,000,000.
bwin Argentina has challenged the freezing orders on the grounds that the sums frozen are not proportionate to the debts.
On 14November 2013, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed a decision pursuant to which the basis for calculating the legal fees is the amount of bwin Argentinas profits from February 2008 to December 2012. bwin Argentina appealed this decision.
Full provision for the frozen funds was charged in the 2013 financial year.
In August and December 2014 respectively, bwin.
party was notified of the Supreme Courts decisions rejecting bwin Argentinas appeal and subsequent extraordinary appeal.
party has therefore exhausted local remedies.
The fees amount to ARS 18,852,489.64 plus 21% VAT approximately 1.9m plus VAT, calculated as 25% of the net wins of bwin Argentina S. A.

Acquisitions during the year On 26 May 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of Servebase Group Limited.
The Group of companies acquired included PXP Solutions Limited, a global multi-channel payment gateway whose in-store payments technology is used by 8,000 merchants and retailers in 27countries worldwide.
Servebase Group Limiteds principal activity is software design with technical support and computer consultancy services.
The principal reasons for the acquisition was to add in-store payment processing to Kalixas product suite as well as provide access to cross-sell Kalixas products to PXPs customer base.
Details of the provisional fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value million million million Property, plant & equipment 0.2 0.2 Developed software 1.5 7.1 8.6 Customer relationships 9.4 9.4 Trade and other receivables 1.0 1.0 Cash and cash equivalents 0.2 0.2 Trade and other payables 1.6 1.6 Deferred tax liability 3.5 3.5 Net assets acquired 1.3 13.0 14.3 Goodwill 22.0 Consideration 36.3 Cash paid on completion 22.7 Cash paid on finalisation of completion accounts 2.5 Contingent consideration 11.1 Consideration 36.3 The intangible assets other than goodwill are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to three years for developed software and up to five years for customer relationships.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill none of which is deductible for tax purposes are the expertise of the workforce, synergies of the deal, the opportunity to cross-sell Kalixas products to PXPs customer base and other non-recognisable benefits.
The amount included above for contingent consideration represents the Directors current best estimate of the amount payable which they consider is likely to be paid, after the effects of discounting.
Initial cash consideration of 20.1m 25.2m was paid with contingent consideration payable of up to 20m 24.6m dependent on which of two options the Group selects before the first anniversary of the acquisition.
Under Option A a further 10m 12.3m would be payable on the first anniversary of the acquisition.
Under Option B up to 20m 24.6m would be payable based on the value of existing PXP Solutions merchant volumes transferred to Kalixa for provision of card acquiring services, as measured on each of the first three anniversaries of the acquisition.
The Group has determined the fair value of contingent consideration taking into account the probability of expected outcomes and appropriate discount rates.
130 NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27.
Acquisitions during the year continued Subsequent to the acquisition, various technical development issues, in particular the deferral of work relating to the integration of a third party suppliers platform as they go through a major upgrade, has meant that the value of the merchant volumes which could be transferred to Kalixa for card acquiring will be significantly lower than anticipated over the performance period for which deferred consideration is measured.
However, the anticipated annual synergies are still expected to be realised, albeit later than planned.
As a result, the expectations relating to the deferred consideration which would be payable were revisited and the balance expected to be paid was reduced significantly.
After the unwinding of some of the interest relating to the deferred consideration, this has led to a credit to other operating income of 11.3m as required by IFRS with the resulting deferred consideration balance of 0.4m remaining within other payables.
In the period since acquisition, The Servebase Group has contributed 3.3m in revenue and 0.3m Clean EBITDA to the Group.
Had the acquisition been made on 1 January 2014, Group revenue would have been 613.9m with an increase in loss after tax of less than 0.1m.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported to management on a monthly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the Internal Audit function.
The last internal control review was undertaken during 2013 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
A review will take place during 2015 as part of an ongoing two year review cycle.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of 200m that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration of refinancing risk.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
In December 2012 the Group entered into a 30m three year amortising term loan of which 5m was repaid in December 2013.
As at 31 December 2014 the drawn balance on this term loan was 25m 2013: 25m.
In December 2013 the Group also entered into a 50m revolving credit facility for managing liquidity risk.
This facility is available for the Group to draw upon until December 2016.
As at 31 December 2014 the drawn balance on the facility was 20m 2013: 15m.

The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that net debt should not exceed 300 million and that the leverage ratio of net debt Clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
For the purposes of these limits net debt is defined as borrowings plus client liability less cash.
2014 2013 As at 31 December million million Loans and borrowings 56.9 46.1 Client liabilities 116.1 124.8 Gross debt 173.0 170.9 Cash and cash equivalents 162.9 173.3 Net debt surplus 10.1 2.4 A review of net debt is as follows: 2014 2013 As at 31 December 2013 million million Net debt million 10.1 2.4 Clean EBITDA million 101.2 108.0 Headroom million 44.3 115.9 Ratio 0.1 n a Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis, including aged debtor analysis, and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their statement of financial position, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.

Financial instruments and risk management continued These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five is assessed as weak.
2014 2013 As at 31 December 2013 million million 1 Very Strong 15.4 24.2 2 Strong 12.6 18.6 3 Good 3.1 4.7 4 Satisfactory 1.3 2.5 PSPs amounts due 32.4 50.0 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts or any impairment expense for the period.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs.
Note 15 details the movement and level of provisions for PSPs.
Cash investments: The Group only invest cash with a small number of very strong European financial institutions.
The Group also invests cash in instant access pooled money market funds with a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moodys rating agency.
The Group can also purchase commercial paper provided the issuer is not a financial institution and has a one year credit default swap, as quoted by Bloomberg, of no more than 1%.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with strong local banks in Gibraltar, UK, France, Malta, Italy, Israel, Bulgaria, Austria, US and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
In Italy, Spain and France the Group maintains domestic segregated player funds accounts as required by the respective regulatory authorities.
Cash is also held as security in Austria, Italy and the UK primarily to support bank guarantees and as reserves for credit and debit card chargebacks.
Other than this, non-central cash balances are kept to a minimum.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 all cash and short-term investment balances were held at banks.
The treasury department may only make the following cash investments, without prior written authority by the Board: cash deposits: pooled money market funds: certificates of deposit: and commercial paper.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk, foreign exchange rates currency risk or other market factors other price risk.
Currency and interest rate risk The Groups current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating rate basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast Sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cash flows are hedged.
The Group may also economically hedge material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a monthly basis.
A 5m currency tolerance limit between Euros and US dollar, Sterling and Canadian dollar reduced to 3m between Euro and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
party Annual report & accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial performance 139 29.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than Euros in order to hedge non-Euro investments up to 50% of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of on-going debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments arising from a 10% strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the Euro, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-Euro currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Whilst the Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents and other assets to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing and LIBOR based loans see note 21, the exposure is actually not significant as the Groups interest bearing assets and liabilities are naturally hedged.
Therefore, interest rate sensitivity analysis has been omitted from the table below.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates so that they vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as a projection of likely future events and losses.

The Group also retains certain insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.

party digital entertainment plc 2014 Incentive Plan BIP The BIP was approved by the Companys shareholders on 24 February 2014 and succeeds two previous plans the Bonus Banking Plan BBP and Value Creation Plan VCP.
The BIP is split into two separate elements.
Element A replaces the BBP and covers a three year period with annual performance targets set at the beginning of each year.
Depending on the extent to which these targets are met, an amount may be credited or debited to the participants bonus account on the measurement date.
50% will be credited in the form of nil-cost share options with the other 50%awarded in cash.
Shortly after the measurement date, 50% of the cash balance will be paid to the participant.
After the initial three years, half of the nil-cost options will vest with the other half plus the balance of any cash award vesting in year four.
If the performance targets in any one year are not met the bonus account will be debited by 50% of its current value.
The maximum annual contribution to the bonus account is 250% of salary.
