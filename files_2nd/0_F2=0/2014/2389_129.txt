Proved reserves replacement Total hydrocarbon proved reserves at 31 December 2014, on an oil equivalent basis including equity-accounted entities, decreased by 3% decrease of 5% for subsidiaries and increase of 1% for equityaccounted entities compared with 31 December 2013.
Natural gas represented about 44% 58% for subsidiaries and 27% for equityaccounted entities of these reserves.
The change includes a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 39mmboe all within our subsidiaries.
Acquisition activity in our subsidiaries occurred in Azerbaijan, the US and the UK, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in the US and Brazil.
The proved reserves replacement ratio is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions.
This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries.
For 2014, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 63% 129% in 2013 and 77% in 2012 for subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, 29% for subsidiaries alone and 116% for equity-accounted entities alone.
The decreased ratio reflected lower reserves bookings as a result of fewer final investment decisions in 2014 and revisions of previous estimates.
In 2014 net additions to the groups proved reserves excluding production and sales and purchases of reserves-in-place amounted to 743mmboe 208mmboe for subsidiaries and 535mmboe for equityaccounted entities, through revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields.
The subsidiary additions through improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields were in existing developments where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves.
Volumes added in 2014 principally resulted from the application of conventional technologies.
The principal proved reserves additions in our subsidiaries were in Angola, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Oman, Trinidad and the US.
We had material reductions in our proved reserves in Norway, the UK, Indonesia and Australia, principally due to activity reduction and reservoir performance.
The principal reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in Argentina and Russia.
Sixteen per cent of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs.
The countries in which we operated under PSAs in 2014 were Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Oman and a non-material volume of our proved reserves in Trinidad.
In addition, the technical service contract TSC governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq functions as a PSA.
