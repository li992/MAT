GENERAL INFORMATION Hargreaves Lansdown plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol BS1 5HL, United Kingdom.
The Company is the parent company of the Hargreaves Lansdown plc Group, and the nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review.
The Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors believe that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 12 months from the date the financial statements are adopted.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, except that it has no policy in respect of consolidation and investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment.
During the year there has been a change in the policy relating to how cash balances are recognised within the Company and subsidiary companies in pooled treasury situations.
Previous policy was to recognise cash balances which form part of a group treasury arrangement within the originating legal entity.
During the year it was decided that recognition of these group treasury balances should follow the legal form of the treasury arrangement with the cash recognised within the company that is externally contractually entitled to the cash balance, and with group treasury balances recognised as intercompany balances between the Company and its subsidiary companies.
This accounting policy change results in the following balance sheet reclassifications but has no impact on retained profits or earnings per share.
