The services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.

The costs are determined in accordance with FRS 20 share based payments.
Any payments made by the subsidiary undertaking in respect of these arrangements are treated as a return of this investment.
