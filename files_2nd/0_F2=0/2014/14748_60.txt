Acquisitions On 12 April 2013, the Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SSE E&P UK Limited, completed the acquisition from BP of a 50% working interest in the Sean gas field in the Southern North Sea.
Following completion settlement including working capital items, the final cash consideration paid for the business was 127.6m, which included 18.0m paid on deposit on 28 January 2013.
The acquisition enhances the Groups presence in the upstream gas sector and provides an additional source of primary fuel to meet the energy demands of the Group.
m Assets acquired: Property, Plant and Equipment 72.9 Other working capital items 6.2 Provisions 27.3 Deferred tax 88.2 Net Assets 127.6 The acquired business contributed 110.0m to revenue and 65.1m to operating profit in the period to 31 March 2014.
Profit after tax was 1.8m for the period to 31 March 2014.
As the business was purchased on 12 April 2013, the notional impact on the Group of a full years operation would not have been significantly greater than that reported.
b. Disposals During the year, the group disposed of businesses for combined cash consideration of 3.2m, and deferred consideration of 1.3m.
These resulted in a gain on disposal of 1.1m.
