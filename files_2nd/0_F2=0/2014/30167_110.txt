Market risk Definition and exposure Market risk is the risk of areduction in earnings, value or reserves caused by changes in the prices of financial instruments.
Inaddition, market risk can arise as aresult of changes in customer behaviour, which may affect the maturity profiles of the Groups assets and liabilities.
The Groups market risk consists almost entirely of exposure to changes in interest rates, includingthe margin between customer and market rates.
This is the potential impact on earnings and value that could occur when, if rates fall, liabilities cannot be re-priced as quickly or by as much as assets: or when, if rates rise, assets cannot be re-priced as quickly or by as much as liabilities.
Management and measurement Risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily, net interest income and earnings sensitivity.
This methodology considers allre-pricing mismatches in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in net interest income that would result from asetof defined interest rate shocks.
Alimit structure exists to ensure that risks stemming from residual and temporary positions orfrom changes in assumptions about customer behaviour remain within the Groups risk appetite.

Market risk continued A 12 month view of the sensitivity of net interest income is calculated on the basis of the Groups current balance sheet with re-pricing dates adjusted according to behavioural assumptions.
At 31 December 2014, the projected change in 12 month net interest income in response to an immediate parallel shift in all relevant interest rates, market and administered, would be an increase of 0.7 million 2013: 0.7 million from a25bps increase in rates, and adecrease of 8.2 million 2013: 10.5 million from a25bps decrease.
The measure, however, is relatively simplistic in that it assumes all interest rates move at the same time and by the same amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group holds derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its banking business for interest rate risk management and margin stabilisation purposes.
Derivatives are held at fair value on the Groups balance sheet.
