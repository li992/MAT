The Companys loss after taxation for the 52 week period 27 April 2014 was 417,000 2013: 3,249,000 loss.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Cost represents cash consideration or the amount of ordinary shares issued by the Company at nominal value after taking account of merger relief available under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 plus related acquisition costs capitalised at fair value.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
No timing differences are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
A deferred tax asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit in future is more unlikely than not.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies Items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At the balance sheet date all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate or at the rate of exchange at which the transaction is contracted to be settled in the future.
All exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Dividends Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements, and as a deduction from equity, in the period in which the dividends are declared.
Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of the Companys shareholders, the dividends are only declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company, with the exception of those accounted for via merger relief available under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Income from Group undertakings Income from Group undertakings is recognised when qualifying consideration is received from the Group undertaking.
