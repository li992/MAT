Taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using UK and foreign tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Groups assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Taxation continued Factors affecting the tax charge in future years Factors that may affect the Groups future tax charge include the impact of corporate restructurings, the resolution of open issues, future planning, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought forward tax losses and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and, specifically, in India these are usually resolved through the Indian legal system.
The Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Groups overall profitability and cash flows in future periods.
See note 30 Contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements.
At 31 March 2014, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 274 461 79,115 79,850 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 1,281 519 26,318 28,118 1,555 980 105,433 107,968 At 31 March 2013, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 343 8,423 8,766 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 1,845 691 94,135 96,671 2,188 691 102,558 105,437 The losses arising on the write down of investments in Germany are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities.
Losses of 15,290 million 2013: 3,236 million are included in the above table on which we have recognised a deferred tax asset as we expect the German business to continue to generate future taxable profits against which we can utilise these losses.
In 2013 the Group did not recognise a deferred tax asset on 12,346 million of the losses as it was uncertain that these losses would be utilised.
Included above are losses amounting to 6,651 million 2013: 7,104 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
We have recognised a deferred tax asset against 442 million of these losses in the current year.
The losses above also include 73,734 million 2013: 70,644 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
A deferred tax asset of 18,150 million 2013: 1,325 million has been recognised in respect of 62,980 million 2013: 4,535 million of these losses which relate to tax groups in Luxembourg where we expect the members of these tax groups to generate future taxable profits against which these losses will be used.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the remaining 10,754 million of these losses as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.
In addition to the above, we hold 7,642 million of losses in overseas holding companies from a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.
The recognition of the additional deferred tax assets, which arose from losses in earlier years, was triggered by the agreement to dispose of the US Group whose principal asset was its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless, which removes significant uncertainty around both the availability of the losses in Germany and the future income streams in Luxembourg.
The Group expects to use the losses over a significant number of years: the actual use of the losses is dependent on many factors which may change, including the level of profitability in both Germany and Luxembourg, changes in tax law and changes to the structure of the Group.
The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group.
There are also 339 million 2013: 5,918 million of unrecognised other temporary differences.
The Group holds no deferred tax liability 2013: 1,812 million in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements were to be realised after the balance sheet date see table above following the Groups disposal of its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 22,985 million 2013: 47,978 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.
