SEGMENT REPORTING Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8.
Further details of these segments are given in the Strategic Report on pages 17 to 19.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year.
All assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment, except for items of a financing nature, taxation balances, employee benefit liabilities and current and non-current asset investments.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the segments.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill The CGU groups below represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and are not larger than the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The carrying values of goodwill are split between the CGU groups as follows: 2014 2013 m m UK 147 147 Western Europe 148 152 DACH and Northern Europe 216 221 Central Europe and Italy 47 53 Plastics 46 51 Total goodwill 604 624 Goodwill impairment tests key assumptions and methodology The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the groups of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
No impairment arose in the year ended 30 April 2014 as the recoverable amount of the groups of CGUs, based on value-in-use calculations, exceeded the carrying amounts.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are: x the cash flow forecasts have been derived from the most recent Board approved budget for the year ending 30 April 2015 and are based upon past performance, known changes and expectations of current market conditions, taking into account the cyclical nature of the business: x the sales volume and price assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are the Directors estimates of likely future changes based upon historic performance and the current economic outlooks for the economies in which the Group operates.
These are viewed as the key operating assumptions as they determine the Directors approach to margin and cost maintenance: x the cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based upon past experience and include the replacement capital expenditure required to generate the terminal cash flows: x cash flows beyond the budgeted period 2016 and beyond have been determined using a long-term growth rate specific to each of the CGU groups based upon external sources such as the International Monetary Funds World Economic Outlook Database.
These resulted in an average growth rate for the total Group of 1.96%: and x the pre-tax adjusted discount rate is derived from the weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group of 9.5% 2012 13: 9.5%.
The WACC is a function of the cost of debt and equity.
The cost of equity is largely based upon the risk free rate for 30 year German Bund yields 70% and 30 year UK gilts 30%, adjusted for the relevant country market risk premium, which reflects the increased risk of investing in country specific equities and the relative volatilities of the equity of the Group compared to the market as a whole.
This Group rate has been adjusted for the risks inherent in the countries in which the CGU group operates that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
Goodwill impairment tests sensitivities The value-in-use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows and results in significant headroom across all CGU groups.
Whilst the Directors believe the assumptions used are realistic, it is possible that a reduction in the headroom would occur if any of the above key assumptions were significantly changed.
Factors which could cause an impairment are: x significant underperformance relative to the forecast: and x further deteriorations in the economies in which the Group operates.
To support their assertions, the Directors have conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the impact that would result from the above situations.
Key sensitivities tested included future growth and discount rates.
In these cases, if estimates of future growth were reduced to 0% per annum, or if the estimated discount rates applied to the cash flows were increased by 1%, there would still be significant headroom to support the carrying value of the assets.
Based on this analysis the Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions detailed above would cause the carrying value of CGU groups to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Therefore at 30 April 2014 no impairment charge is required against the carrying value of goodwill.

As such, the Groups 50% interest in Italmaceri S. r. l. has changed from proportionate consolidation to equity accounting in the current period, as it is classified as a joint venture.
The comparative period has not been restated for the change described above because the change is immaterial to the Groups results.

Borrowings are measured at amortised cost, except for 77m of note purchase agreements in a fair value hedge relationship 30 April 2013: 87m.
The Groups bank loan consisted of a 610m syndicated revolving credit facility with an expiry date of 23 September 2016.
Advances drawn down under the facility bore interest at a margin over the applicable LIBOR or EURIBOR rate.
The Group also had a 380m 313m syndicated term loan with an expiry date of 30 June 2016.
This facility bore interest at a margin over EURIBOR.
The Group has entered into interest rate swap derivatives with bank counterparties to fix a proportion of the interest on this facility in compliance with Group hedging policy on interest rate risk management.
Since the year end, the Group has refinanced its committed bank borrowing facilities.
The syndicated term loan facility, under which 380m was outstanding at 30 April 2014, was repaid on 23 May 2014, and replaced with a 300m syndicated bank term loan facility maturing in May 2017.
In addition, on the same date, the 610m syndicated revolving credit facility was repaid and replaced with a 800m syndicated bank revolving credit facility maturing in 2019, but with options to extend this facility to 2021.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups activities expose the Group to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
A summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Principal Risk sections of the Strategic Report.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into in line with the Groups risk management objectives.
The Groups treasury policy prohibits entering into speculative transactions.
a Carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is the accounting classification of the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: 2014 2013 Carrying Carrying Fair value Fair value amount amount m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 98 98 116 116 Other investments restricted cash 66 22 22 Available for sale other investments 33 11 Loans and receivables 653 653 647 647 Other financial assets in designated hedge accounting relationships 66 10 10 Total financial assets 766 766 796 796 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 934 934 966 966 Bank and other loans 423 423 428 428 Note purchase agreements 455 514 490 583 Finance lease liabilities 4 4 6 6 Bank overdrafts 34 34 38 38 Other financial liabilities in designated hedge accounting relationships 60 60 23 23 Total financial liabilities 1,910 1,969 1,951 2,044 The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms-length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, only the portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The majority of the Group's note purchase agreements are in effective cash flow and net investment hedges and are therefore held at amortised cost.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities which bear floating rates of interest are estimated to be equivalent to their book values.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires the classification of fair value measurements using the fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the assessments.
All of the Groups financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments, where inputs are observable for the asset and liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements 107 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED b Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity contracts, to manage the risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the financing of these activities.
All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.
The assets and liabilities of the Group at 30 April in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 m m m m m m Derivatives held to: Manage the interest rate and currency exposures on borrowings and net investments 4 9 44 20 40 11 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 4 9 44 20 40 11 Derivatives held to hedge future transactions Energy costs 2 1 16 3 14 2 Total derivative financial instruments 6 10 60 23 54 13 Current 2 1 20 2 18 1 Non-current 4 9 40 21 36 12 6 10 60 23 54 13 c Cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges i Cash flow hedging reserve movements The following table identifies the movements in the cash flow hedging reserve during the year.

The receive leg of the swap contracts is identical in all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and therefore the hedging is treated as highly effective.
The pre-tax loss on hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement during the year was 11m 2012 13: gain of 17m offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of 12m 2012 13: loss of 16m.
iii Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group holds cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax gain on the hedges recognised in equity during the year was 7m 2012 13: loss of 9m.
This gain is matched by a similar loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiarys net assets resulting in a net gain of nil 2012 13: net gain of 1m treated as hedge ineffectiveness in the income statement.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Risk identification and risk management i Capital management The Group defines its managed capital as equity as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position and net debt see note 18.
2014 2013 m m Net debt 827 817 Total equity 1,131 1,085 Managed capital 1,958 1,902 There have been no changes to the components of managed capital during the year.
Managed capital is different from capital employed defined as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, working capital, capital debtors creditors, provisions and assets liabilities held for sale.
Managed capital relates to our sources of funding, whereas return on average capital employed is our measure of the level of return being generated by the asset base.
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of capital: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders equity and, where appropriate, disposals of non-core businesses.
The Groups objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing flexibility in short and medium-term funding so as to accommodate significant investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowing from a variety of sources.
The Groups overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed, as described elsewhere in this note.
The Groups treasury strategy is controlled through the Balance Sheet Committee which meets regularly and includes the Group Finance Director, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Group Financial Controller, the Group Treasurer and the Group Tax Manager.
The Group Treasury function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer.
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for financial risk management.
ii Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices.
The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as borrowings are arranged at fixed interest rates exposing it to fair value risk and floating interest rates exposing it to future cash flow risk.
The risk is managed by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating-rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts which modify the interest payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
At 30 April 2014, 71% of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings were at fixed rates of interest 30 April 2013: 72%.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group had variable-rate borrowings at 30 April 2014.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all variable-rate external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Groups interest rate derivatives.
Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments only affect the Groups income statement.
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

At 30 April 2014, losses of 20m 30 April 2013: losses of 17m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
These will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will be during the period to 2022.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements 109 21.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Groups presentational currency, sterling.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swap contracts.
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in equity.
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange risk on transactions Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales or purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 30 April 2014, losses net of tax deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges were nil 30 April 2013: nil.
These amounts will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur within one year.
The Groups main currency exposure is to the euro and the following significant exchange rates applied during the year: 2014 2013 Average Closing Average Closing euro 1.191 1.215 1.222 1.180 The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Groups results of a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling exchange rate against all other currencies representing managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The analysis is restricted to financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Loans that are treated as net investment hedges are not included within the impact on the Groups profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these is offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge.

The majority of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
At 30 April 2014, losses of 11m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 30 April 2013: losses of 1m.
These will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur within three years.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is managements assessment of the reasonably possible change, on average, over any given year.
A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity.
As all of the Groups commodity financial instruments achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either year.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED d Risk identification and risk management continued iii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the Group.
In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets at 30 April 2014 was 766m and is analysed in note 21 a.
This represents the maximum credit risk exposure.
Credit risk on financial instruments held with financial institutions is assessed and managed by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned to that counterparty by Standard & Poors and Moodys credit rating agencies.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
See note 15 for information on credit risk with respect to trade receivables.
iv Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 30 April 2014, the Group had 496m of undrawn committed facilities available 30 April 2013: 517m.
The Group mitigates its refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a number of different sources with a range of maturities.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The following table is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual maturities of derivative financial instruments excluding interest payments and receipts.
Where the payable and receivable legs of these derivatives are denominated in foreign currencies, the contractual payments or receipts have been calculated based on exchange rates prevailing at the respective year-ends.

These losses include 10m 30 April 2013: 13m which do not expire and 3m which expire between 2017 and 2019 under current tax legislation 30 April 2013: 6m expire between 2017 and 2019.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise these benefits.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 206m 30 April 2013: 195m relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 30 April 2014 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdiction in which these subsidiaries operate.

Own shares The reserve for the Companys own shares comprises the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group.
The Group operates a General Employee Benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Performance Share Plan and the Share Matching Plan.
At 30 April 2014, the Trust held 0.5m shares 30 April 2013: 2.1m shares.
The market value of the shares at 30 April 2014 was 2m 30 April 2013: 5m.
Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Non-controlling interests The Group has various put options in relation to subsidiaries with non-controlling interests.
The Group records a liability at the net present value of the expected future payments, with a corresponding entry against non-controlling interests in respect of the non-controlling shareholders put option, measured at fair value.
At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recorded within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into non-controlling interests.

The plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements and their legal status and control vary depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Representatives of the Group work with those managing the employee benefit arrangements to monitor the effects of volatility in financial markets and the impact of uncertainty in assumptions, to develop strategies that could mitigate the risks to which these employee benefit schemes expose the Group.
UK schemes The Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme, the DS Smith Group Pension Scheme the Group Scheme is a UK funded final salary defined benefit scheme providing pensions and lump sum benefits to members and dependants.
The Group Scheme closed to future accrual from 30 April 2011 with pensions calculated based on salaries up to the point of closure or earlier date of leaving the Group Scheme.
The Group Scheme has a normal retirement age of 65 although some members are able to take some of their benefits earlier than this.
Changes in inflation impact increases to pensions for the majority of members.
The Group Scheme is governed by a Trustee Company DS Smith Pension Trustees Limited, which is comprised of a Board of Trustee Directors the Trustee Board and is independent of the Group.
The Trustee Board has control over the operation, funding and investment strategy of the Group Scheme.
UK legislation requires the Trustee Board to carry out valuations at least every three years and to target full funding against a basis that prudently reflects the Group Schemes risk exposure.
The most recent valuation is being carried out as at 30 April 2013.
In the event of underfunding the Group is required to agree a deficit recovery plan with the Trustee Board within statutory deadlines.
The most recent deficit recovery plan made based on the valuation as at 30 April 2010 agreed that the Group would remove the shortfall by paying annual contributions, starting at 15m in the year ended 30 April 2012 and increasing by 2% per annum, such that the final contribution is 18m in the year ending 30 April 2021.
As part of the 30 April 2010 valuation the Trustee Board and the Group also agreed to put in place a secondary Long-Term Funding Target the LTFT, in addition to the statutory funding requirements, the purpose of which is to achieve material additional security for the Group Schemes members.
The objective of the LTFT is for the Group Scheme to reach self-sufficiency by 30 April 2035. dssmith.
com 114 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 25.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED UK schemes continued The Group Schemes assets are invested in a diversified range of assets, details of which are set out above.
A portion of the assets are invested in inflationindexed bonds to provide a partial hedge against inflation and the Group Scheme has adopted a trigger based process that moves assets from corporate bonds to index-linked gilts when specific real triggers are met.
If inflation increases the Group Scheme obligation will likely increase more significantly than any change in the fair value of the assets: this would result in an increase in the net liability.
Approximately 50% of the Group Schemes overseas equity currency exposure is hedged back to sterling.
To help the Trustee Board to monitor, review and assess investment matters, the Investment SubCommittee the ISC, which consists of representatives from the Trustee Board and the Group, meets on a quarterly basis throughout the financial year.
The Group Scheme exposes the Group to risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and investment risk.
As the Group Schemes obligation is to provide lifetime pension benefits to members upon retirement, increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Group Schemes liabilities.
Other assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation are also uncertain.
The largest defined contribution arrangement operated by the Group is in the UK.
The UK defined contribution scheme is a trust-based arrangement offering members a range of investments.
Friends Life is the preferred provider.
All assets are held independently from the Group.
The Group also operates a small unfunded scheme in the UK.
Overseas schemes The countries where the Group operates the most significant defined benefit post-retirement arrangements are: x France various mandatory retirement indemnities, post-retirement medical plans and jubilee arrangements, in the majority determined by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement: x Italy mandatory end-of-service lump sum benefits in respect of pre-2007 service: x Switzerland funded scheme, affiliated to a fully insured joint foundation similar to a multi-employer scheme : and x Germany jubilee benefits and non-contributory defined benefit pension schemes.
In general, local trustees or similar bodies manage the post-retirement and medical plans in accordance with local regulations.
Jubilee benefits are paid to employees after completion of a certain number of years of service.
Other employee benefits relate to pre-retirement benefits in Germany.
Overseas schemes expose the Group to risks such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, investment risk, life expectancy risk and healthcare cost risk.
Actions taken by the local regulator, or changes to European legislation, could result in stronger local funding standards, which could affect the Groups future cash flow.

The Group made agreed contributions of 15m to the Group Scheme in 2013 14 2012 13: 18m.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The Groups current best estimate of contributions expected to the Group Scheme in the year ending 30 April 2015 is approximately 16m.
However, the triennial valuations currently being undertaken are not yet finalised.
When they are, the amount of future contributions may differ from this estimate.
Significant actuarial assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions for the Group Scheme are as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.4% 3.9% Inflation 2.3% 2.2% Pre-retirement pension increases 2.3% 2.2% Future pension increases for pre 30 April 2005 service 2.3% 2.2% Future pension increases for post 30 April 2005 service 2.1% 2.0% For other overseas arrangements, the weighted average actuarial assumptions are a discount rate of 2.7% 30 April 2013: 2.9% and an inflation rate of 2.4% 30 April 2013: 1.8%.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with the relevant standard mortality tables in each country.
For the Group Scheme at 30 April 2014, the mortality base table used is S1NMA S1NFA year of birth with a 1 year age rating, with CMI 2013 projections with a 1.25% per annum long-term rate of improvement used for future longevity improvement.
At 30 April 2013, whilst the mortality base table used was the same, CMI 2009 projections with a 1.0% long-term rate of improvement were used for future longevity improvement.
As part of the Group Scheme actuarial valuation exercise the projected life expectancies were as follows: 2014 2013 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy at age 65 Pensioner currently aged 65 21.4 23.8 21.2 23.4 Member currently aged 45 23.2 25.7 22.6 24.9 dssmith.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the liabilities in the Group Scheme to each significant actuarial assumption is summarised in the following table, showing the impact on the defined benefit obligation if each assumption is altered by the amount specified in isolation, whilst assuming that all other variables remain the same.
In practice, this approach is not necessarily realistic since some assumptions are related.
This sensitivity analysis applies to the defined benefit obligation only and not to the net defined benefit pension liability, the measurement of which depends on a number of factors including the fair value of plan assets.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: i A Performance Share Plan PSP.
Awards under the PSP normally become exercisable after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
Awards have been made under the PSP annually since 2008, based on the following performance measures, in the proportions shown below: i. the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250: ii.
average adjusted earnings per share EPS : and iii.
average adjusted return on average capital employed ROACE.
x The 2008 award was subject to three equally-weighted performance measures TSR, average adjusted EPS, and average adjusted ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the Business Segments, the three equally-weighted measures were TSR, average adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
Of these awards, 55.1% of the TSR element have vested, and have been fully exercised.
x The 2009 award was subject to two performance measures 80% based on a TSR component and 20% based on average adjusted ROACE.
For those senior executives working in one of the Business Segments, the two measures were TSR and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment.
The 2009 awards have vested in full, and have been fully exercised.
x The 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards are subject to three performance measures: i.
50% of each award based on a TSR component: ii.

The Substitute Share Bonus Award vested in full on the vesting date but has not yet been exercised.
Mr Roberts was entitled to a cash payment on vesting, representing a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid on his vested shares while they were subject to his awards.
There were no performance conditions governing the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award because the awards they replicated had no performance conditions attaching to them.
iv The Recruitment Award for Mr M W Roberts is subject to substantially the same terms as the awards made under the Companys PSP in 2009.
The award vested in full on 19 October 2012 and has been fully exercised.

In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan.
The first award under this Plan has now vested but is not yet fully exercised.
An international Sharesave Plan was introduced in January 2014.
The main provisions of this are the same as for the January 2011 Plan, subject to minor country specific variances.

The fair value of awards granted in the period relates to the PSP, DSBP and SMP schemes.
The fair value of the PSP award granted during the year, determined using the stochastic valuation model, was 3.7m.
The significant inputs into the model were: a share price of 250.9p for the PSP at the grant date: the exercise prices shown above: an expected initial volatility of the share price of 29.1% and long-term volatility of 28.9%: the scheme life disclosed above: an annual risk-free interest rate of 0.63% and an expected dividend yield of nil.
The volatility of share price returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of average weekly share prices from 1 January 1970.

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At 30 April 2014, the Group had committed to incur capital expenditure of 3m 30 April 2013: 9m.
The Group is not subject to a material litigation but has a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business on behalf of trading subsidiaries including, inter alia, intellectual property disputes and regulatory enquiries on areas such as health and safety, environmental, and anti-trust.
No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities.
As a result of previous acquisitions, various contingent liabilities were identified and included within provisions, as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors best estimate has been updated and included in the closing provision balance at 30 April 2014.
Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements 121 31.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTMENTS a 2013 14 acquisitions and disposals During the current financial year, the Group completed various business combination transactions with total cash consideration of 27m, and various business disposals with total cash consideration of 12m which are not considered material to the Group individually or in aggregate.
b 2012 13 acquisitions and disposals On 30 June 2012, the Group acquired SCA Packaging.
The acquisition was effected by the purchase of equity of 100% of SCA Packaging Holding BV and SCA Packaging Nicollet SAS for 1,281 million 1.6 billion on a cash, debt and, to the extent legally possible and commercially practicable, pension free basis.
This was subject to customary post-completion adjustments.
Certain fair values assigned to the net assets at the date of acquisition were provisional and, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Group has adjusted the fair values attributable to this acquisition during the year ended 30 April 2014, resulting in a net decrease in goodwill of 3m.
During the year ended 30 April 2014, the Group completed settlement of post-completion adjustments with SCA, the effect of which is included within exceptional items.
On 25 May 2012, the European Commission granted competition clearance for the SCA Packaging acquisition.
The clearance required the Group to divest three sites after the acquisition, which represented approximately 1% of the enlarged Group profit.
All three remedy disposal sites were divested during the year ended 30 April 2013 for total proceeds of 43m.
The Group incurred transaction costs of 2m of which 0.5m was recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 April 2013, with the remainder included in the opening fair value less cost to sell of the two remedy disposal sites gained through the SCA Packaging acquisition.
In the year ended 30 April 2013, the Group made additional minor disposals of associates and subsidiary businesses for proceeds of 8m, net of cash and cash equivalents.
These include the Groups associate GAE Smith, UK Packaging disposals and the sale of the Groups Norwegian subsidiary.
c Office Products Wholesaling In April 2013, DS Smith received 7m in relation to final settlement of the disposal of its Office Products Wholesaling division in 2011 12 to Unipapel SA, which was recorded in discontinued operations in 2012 13.
In 2013 14 a tax expense of 3m was incurred for tax balances written off in relation to the disposal which was recorded in discontinued operations.
d Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 4m in 2013 14 2012 13: 11m.
In 2013 14 these primarily related to finalisation of the completion accounts process of the SCA Packaging acquisition in the previous year, as well as other deal costs relating to aborted acquisitions.
These costs have been included in administrative expenses in the Groups income statement within exceptional items.
RELATED PARTIES Identity of related parties In the normal course of business the Group undertakes a wide variety of transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The key management personnel of the Company comprise the Chairman, Executive Directors and non-Executive Directors.
The compensation of key management personnel can be found in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Certain key management also participate in the Groups share-based incentive programme note 26.
Included within the share-based payment expense is a charge of 1m 2012 13: 1m relating to key management.
