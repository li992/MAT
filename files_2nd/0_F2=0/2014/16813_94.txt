Vodafone Group Plc 114 Annual Report 2014 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4.
Impairment losses Impairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are expected to generate.
We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually.
For further details on our impairment review process see Critical accounting judgements in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cashgenerating units.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The Group prepares and approves formal five year management plans for its operations, which are used in the value in use calculations.
In certain developing markets the fifth year of the management plan is not indicative of the long-term future performance as operations may not have reached maturity.
For these operations, the Group extends the plan data for an additional five year period.
Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment losses Following our annual impairment review, the net impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit, in respect of goodwill, licences and spectrum fees, and property, plant and equipment are stated below.
The impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.

Budgeted capital expenditure The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide enhanced voice and data products and services and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Groups licences.
Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Long-term growth rate For businesses where the five year management plans are used for the Groups value in use calculations, along-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: a the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and a the long-term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Groups operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory.
Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisition proposals.
Year ended 31 March 2014 During the year ended 31 March 2014 impairment charges of 4,900 million, 800 million, 500 million, 200 million and 200 million were recorded in respect of the Groups investments in Germany, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic and Romania respectively.
The impairment charges relate solely to goodwill.
The recoverable amount of Germany, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic and Romania were 23.0 billion, 3.3 billion, 1.3 billion, 0.6 billion and 1.2 billion respectively.
The impairment charges are driven by lower projected cash flows within the business plans resulting in our reassessment of expected future business performance in the light of current trading and economic conditions.

Impairment losses continued Sensitivity analysis Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Groups operations in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic, Romania and Greece are equal to, or not materially greater than, their carrying values: consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The changes in the following table to assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation, lead to an increase decrease to the aggregate impairment loss recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014.

Year ended 31 March 2013 During the year ended 31 March 2013 impairment charges of 4,500 million and 3,200 million were recorded in respect of the Groups investments in Italy and Spain respectively.
The recoverable amounts of Italy and Spain were 8.9 billion and 4.2 billion respectively.
The impairment charges were driven by a combination of lower projected cash flows within business plans, resulting from our reassessment of expected future business performance in light of current trading and economic conditions and adverse movements in discount rates driven by the credit rating and yields on ten year government bonds.

Year ended 31 March 2012 During the year ended 31 March 2012 impairment charges of 2,450 million, 900 million, 450 million and 250 million were recorded in respect of the Groups investments in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, respectively.
Of the total charge, 3,848 million related to goodwill, and 202 million was allocated in Greece to licence intangible assets 121 million and property, plant and equipment 81 million.
The recoverable amounts of Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal were 13.5 billion, 7.4 billion, 0.4 billion and 1.8 billion respectively.
The impairment charges were primarily driven by increased discount rates as a result of increases in bond rates, with the exception of Spain where rates reduced marginally compared to 31 March 2011.
In addition, business valuations were negatively impacted by lower cash flows within business plans reflecting challenging economic and competitive conditions, and faster than expected regulatory rate cuts, particularly in Italy.
