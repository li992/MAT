STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REXAM ANNUAL REPORT 2014 139 29 SHARE BASED PAYMENT i Summary of Rexams share based payment schemes Scheme name Abbreviation Scheme status Settlement basis Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 LTIP Open Equity and cash Savings Related Share Option Schemes SAYE Open Equity Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Closed Equity Phantom Stock Plan Phantoms Closed Cash LTIP The LTIP is the primary long term incentive plan for Rexams executive directors, band 1 and 2 executives and other senior management.
The LTIP measures performance targets over a three year period.
Options will normally vest, subject to performance targets being achieved, on the third anniversary of the date of grant at a nominal cost to the employee.
Employees who leave with a right to exercise options must normally wait until the end of the measurement period.
If the option vests, the employee will receive an entitlement which normally will be time apportioned for the period from the start of the measurement period to the date on which employment ended.
Options granted in 2014 to executive directors and band 1 and 2 executives are subject to two performance conditions, compound annual growth in underlying earnings per share EPS and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, in the proportion 75% and 25%, respectively.
The EPS element has a return on capital employed underpin.
These options are equity settled.
Options granted in 2014 to other senior management are subject to 100% EPS.
These options are cash settled.
Options include a dividend equivalent element whereby employees will be entitled to receive, in cash, the notional dividends paid during the measurement period on any options that vest.
For further details of the LTIP refer to the directors remuneration report.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Annual grants of options over shares are currently made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at the invitation date.
Options vest three, five or seven years after the commencement of the savings contract, depending on the term selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
ESOS Prior to 2009, annual grants of options over ordinary shares were made to certain senior management.
For grants up to and including 2006, shares vested if a performance target growth in economic profit was met over the three year measurement period.
No performance targets were set for the 2007 and 2008 grants.
Options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price was set at market value using the market price of a Rexam share at the grant date.
Phantoms This cash settled scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS scheme and relates to certain senior management located outside the UK and Europe.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coefficient for LTIP is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using three year daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement period.
