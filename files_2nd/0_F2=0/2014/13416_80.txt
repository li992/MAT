Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available for sale financial assets, bank overdrafts and floating rate bank loans.
The carrying values of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their short term nature.
The fair value of the subordinated bond has been determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on 31 December.
The fair value of the US private placements has been approximated using the market value of similar instruments with similar parameters issued around the same time.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and fixed rate loans have been determined by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of forward commodity contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market at prevailing forward prices.
The subordinated bond is categorised as level 1 in the fair value measurement table, as a quoted market price has been used to determine its fair value.
All other financial instruments in the above tables are categorised as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, whereby the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques.
The valuation techniques for level 2 instruments use observable market data where it is available and rely less on estimates.
At 31 December 2013, the Healthcare assets and liabilities classified as held for sale were written down to their fair value less costs to sell.
This was a non recurring fair value.
At 31 December 2013, Rexam had announced the proposed sale of the pharmaceutical devices and prescription retail packaging divisions of Healthcare for $805m.
These two divisions were measured using observable inputs, being the externally reported price for the business, and are therefore within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The remaining closures and containers division of Healthcare at 31 December 2013 was measured based on unobservable inputs, being a combination of bids from market participants and financial forecasts developed internally, and was therefore wholly within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
126 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED ii Financial risk management The Group bases its financial risk management on sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
Group treasury operations are carried out under policies and parameters approved by the Rexam board.
a Market risk: currencies Currency risks arise from the multi currency cash flows within the Group.
These risks arise from exchange rate fluctuations relating to the translation of balance sheet items of foreign subsidiaries translation risk and from currency flows from sales and purchases transaction risk.
Although the Group does not directly hedge translation risk it does mitigate the impact by borrowing a proportion of debt, either directly or through the use of cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, in currencies which match or are correlated to the currencies of the overseas businesses.
This approach also provides some protection against the foreign exchange translation of overseas earnings as it matches the currency of earnings to the currency of the interest expense.
These amounts are included in the consolidated financial statements by translation into sterling at the balance sheet date and, where hedge accounted, offset in equity against the translation movement in net assets.
Some cross currency swaps used to manage the Groups currency exposures, whilst economically effective, are ineligible for hedge accounting treatment.
The policy regarding transaction risk is to hedge the reported net transaction exposure in full less an allowance for variability in forecasting.
This is generally achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts with amounts hedged being based on the reporting from individual Group businesses.
None of the foreign exchange derivative instruments at 31 December 2014 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IAS39 hedge accounting treatment was not applied.
Foreign exchange derivative instruments are used for hedging general business exposures in foreign currencies such as the purchase and sale of goods, capital expenditure and dividend flows.
Transactional foreign exchange risks are hedged by Group treasury unless it is a legal requirement in the country where the foreign exchange risk arises that hedging is carried out locally.
In the latter case, hedging is carried out by the individual responsible for treasury within the local business, but still operating within the overall Group policy on foreign exchange management.
The currency denomination of borrowings at 31 December 2014 was 58% in US dollars and 42% in euros 2013: 68% US dollars, 32% euros.
In response to the instabilities in certain currency markets, Rexam uses its Treasury Risk Committee comprising members from Group treasury, Group enterprise risk management and relevant businesses to identify key exposures, discuss and monitor developments and develop appropriate mitigation actions.
b Market risk: interest rates Changes in interest rates on interest bearing receivables and floating rate debt in different currencies create interest rate risk.
The objective of the Groups interest rate risk management is to manage its exposure to the impact of changes in interest rates in the currencies in which debt is borrowed.
Group policy is normally to keep between 35% and 85% of interest on borrowings at fixed rates although approval may be sought for higher percentages of fixed rate debt.
Interest rate risk is managed through the issue of fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate derivatives that are used to manage the overall fixed to floating mix of debt, which was 90% fixed and 10% floating at 31 December 2014 2013: 89% and 11%.
Group treasury operates within a broad framework in respect of the mix of fixed and floating rate debt, as the optimum blend will vary depending on the mix of currencies and the Groups view of the debt markets at any point in time.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on bank deposit rates in the relevant currency.
Short term deposits are usually made for periods varying between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Other floating rate financial instruments are at the appropriate LIBOR interest rates as adjusted by variable margins.
Interest on floating rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Some interest rate swaps used to manage the Groups fixed to floating debt mix, whilst economically effective, are ineligible for hedge accounting treatment.
Fair value gains and losses on these hedges are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In 2014, there was a loss of 1m 2013: 1m on fair value changes on financing derivatives, disclosed separately within interest expense in the consolidated income statement.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REXAM ANNUAL REPORT 2014 127 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Market risk: commodity prices Changes in the market price of commodities used by the Group create commodity risk.
Group policy is to manage these risks through both its supply chain management and through use of financial derivatives.
Where financial derivatives are used, the Group uses mainly over the counter instruments transacted with banks, which are themselves priced through a recognised commodity exchange, such as the London Metal Exchange.
The Group manages the purchase of certain raw materials, including aluminium, iron ore, gas and diesel through physical supply contracts which, in the main, relate directly to commodity price indices.
With regard to aluminium, which represents the Groups largest commodity exposure, the policy is to eliminate as far as possible any market price variability through hedging in tandem with contractual commitments to customers.
Where Rexam assumes the aluminium price risk on customer contracts, it has defined a risk appetite with a predetermined aggregate consolidated income statement limit arising from any related aluminium hedging activities.
Its position against this limit is monitored and reported on a monthly basis.
For other commodities, the policy is to follow an incremental hedge approach over a period of up to three years in order to manage the price year on year and limit uncertainty.
None of the commodity derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2014 related to derivative trading activity, although fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because hedge accounting was not applied or hedges were ineffective.
The commodity hedges mainly relate to contracted and expected future purchases of aluminium, but also include iron ore, gas and diesel.
d Market risk: sensitivities A sensitivity analysis for financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk is set out below.
Each risk is analysed separately and shows the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities when a certain risk is changed.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on balances at 31 December each year.
The rates used are based on historical trends and, where relevant, projected forecasts.
Key methods and assumptions made when performing the sensitivity analysis net of hedging : a For the floating rate element of interest rate swaps and borrowings, the sensitivity calculation is performed based on the floating rates at 31 December each year.
b The translation impact of overseas subsidiaries into sterling is not included in the sensitivity analysis.
c The sensitivity analysis ignores any tax implications.
Currencies The foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis set out in the table below is based on foreign currency positions, other than each Group entitys own functional currency, on the balance sheet at 31 December.
The analysis includes only risks arising from financial instruments and gives the estimated impact on profit before tax and equity of a 10% increase and decrease in exchange rates between currency pairs with significant currency positions.

If euro and sterling interest rates were increased by 1% with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would increase by 3m 2013: nil as a result of floating debt being swapped into fixed rate debt.
A reduction in interest rates would not have a significant effect on profit before tax.
There was no significant interest rate risk relating to equity in either year.
128 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Commodity prices At 31 December 2014 and at 31 December 2013 the Group had aluminium commodity contracts that were ineffective from an accounting perspective resulting in fair value movements from the date of the last effective test being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
With respect to ineffective aluminium commodity contracts, if the aluminium price was increased or decreased by 10% with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would increase or decrease by 20m 2013: 31m.
With respect to cash flow hedged aluminium commodity contracts, if the aluminium price was increased or decreased by 10% with all other variables held constant, equity would increase or decrease by 2m.
Equity prices The Group is not subject to any significant equity price risk.

The above table assumes that the bond will be redeemed at maturity, which is Rexams current expectation.
The Group monitors its liquidity to maintain a sufficient level of undrawn committed debt facilities, thereby ensuring financial flexibility.
At 31 December 2014, Rexam had 817m of undrawn committed debt facilities available 2013: 817m.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REXAM ANNUAL REPORT 2014 129 24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The Group mitigates refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a range of different sources.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk associated with financial instruments of the Group.
Credit risk arises from exposures to external counterparties.
In order to manage this risk, the Group has strict credit control quality measures that are applied to counterparty institutions and also limits on maximum exposure levels to any one counterparty.
To manage credit risk, the maximum limits for bank exposures held under Group policy are set out in the table below by individual counterparty credit rating category.
These limits are used when making investments and for the use of derivative instruments.
The table also sets out the Groups financial asset exposure at 31 December for each counterparty credit rating category.
g Capital risk management The Groups objective is to minimise its cost of capital by optimising the efficiency of its capital structure, being the balance between equity and debt.
The Group views its ordinary share capital as equity.
This objective is always subject to an overriding principle that capital must be managed to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group is able to adjust its capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity and by adjustment to the dividend paid to equity holders.
The Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including its weighted average cost of capital and net debt to EBITDA and ensures that its capital structure provides sufficient financial strength to allow it to secure access to debt finance at reasonable cost.
At 31 December 2014, the Groups net debt to EBITDA for financial covenant purposes was 1.4 times 2013: 1.5 times.
The Group aims to keep this ratio below 2.5 times.
For this purpose, net debt is broadly net borrowings adjusted to exclude interest accruals, certain derivative financial instruments and an equity portion of the subordinated bond and reflects non sterling amounts at average exchange rates.
EBITDA is underlying operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation of computer software and adjusted where appropriate to include acquisitions on a pro forma basis and exclude disposed businesses.

In the absence of such an election, derivatives will be settled on a gross basis.
However, each party to the master netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on an offset basis in the event of default of the other party.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group has designated cross currency swaps as fair value hedges whereby interest is receivable at fixed interest rates of 6.75% and payable at floating rates.
These swaps, which mature in 2017, hedge changes in the fair value of the euro subordinated bond which matures in 2067.
Net ineffectiveness gains of 4m were included in interest in 2014 2013: 2m.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2014, the Group has designated forward foreign exchange contracts, some aluminium commodity contracts and gas commodity contracts as cash flow hedges.
The forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency transaction risk and mature between 2015 and 2017.
The aluminium and gas commodity contracts hedge future anticipated purchases of aluminium and gas, respectively, and mature between 2015 and 2016.
Not hedge accounted The Group also has aluminium commodity contracts which were ineffective from an accounting perspective and all fair value movements are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
These hedges mature between 2015 and 2017.
In addition other derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
