These guarantees as at 31 December 2014 are in-the-money by 0.1 million 2013: 0.2 million in-the-money.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
iii Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and up to 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2014, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 1 billion 2013: 1 billion with a further reserve of 6.1 million 2013: 0.1 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 13.9 billion 2013: 11 billion, with a further provision of 42 million 2013: 43 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 34 million 2013: 7 million in Spain and nil 2013: nil in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2014 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.37% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
In the local valuation there is no allowance for stochastic modelling of guarantees and options.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.

Prior year movements primarily relates to the disposal of US Life in 2013.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The changes to the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to business in the UK and Ireland, with corresponding movements in gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 45, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.
