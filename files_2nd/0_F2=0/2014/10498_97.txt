Financial statements 132 Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2014 2 Operating segments Identification of the Groups externally reportable operating segments The Groups externally reportable segments reflect the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Group operates under two primary geographic regions reflecting its South African activities and assets, and its international, principally European, activities and assets.
The broad Europe & International Division is further split by product segments.
Reorganisation of business segments During the year, the Group refined its organisational structure, resulting in several changes to segmental reporting.
The most significant of these changes were the: transfer of the release liner business from Fibre Packaging to Consumer Packaging to take advantage of identified synergies in customer relations, innovation and the global footprint of these businesses: and transfer of the 66,000 tonne per annum kraft paper machine at the Ruomberok mill from Uncoated Fine Paper to Packaging Paper.
All comparative segmental information has been restated.
The reorganisation had no impact on the overall Group result.
