Fair value measurements continued The Master Fund and its Subsidiaries policy is to recognise transfers in and transfers out of each level as at the end of each month.
Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 have occurred due to the change in availability of observable market data.
There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Master Fund and its Subsidiaries had no investments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the year ended 31 December 2014.
The following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets measured at fair value.
Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Master Fund and its Subsidiaries have classified within the Level 3 category.
As a result, the unrealised gains and losses for assets within the Level 3 category in the table below may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable e. g. changes in market interest rates and unobservable e. g. changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities inputs.
