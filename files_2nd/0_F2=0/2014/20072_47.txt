182 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COPPER estimates as at 31 December 2014 EXPLANATORY NOTES Copper Reserves: A minimum cut-off of 0.20% TCu, ICu or ASCu is applied to determine Ore Reserves on operations.
Collahuasi Oxide and Mixed: The increase is due to new economic assumptions in the mine plan for the Rosario Sur I and II areas.
El Soldado Sulphide Flotation : The Ore Reserve estimates include mineralised void-fill material from the collapse of previously mined areas of approximately 178kt Contained Metal 20.6Mt at 0.86 %TCu El Soldado Oxide Heap Leach : Production has exhausted the remaining Heap Leach material.
Los Bronces Sulphide Dump Leach : The decrease is due to production and adjustment as a result of a modified cut-off grade strategy applied in the latest life of mine plan.
Mantos Blancos Oxide Vat and Heap Leach : The decrease is due to production, a modified design of Phase 17 and exclusion of phase 21 from the latest life of mine plan.
The decrease is partially offset by drilling of the Mercedes Dump and application of new estimation parameters.
Mantos Blancos Oxide Dump Leach : The increase is due to a sonic drill campaign on the Mercedes Dump.
The Dump Leach Reserves are comprised primarily of two major components, Mercedes Dump and Este Dump, split as follows: Este Dump Probable: 7kt Contained Metal 3.6 Mt at 0.20 %ASCu.
Mercedes Dump Proved: 1kt Contained Metal 0.6 Mt at 0.17 %ASCu, Probable: 58kt Contained Metal 29.0 Mt at 0.20 %ASCu.
Mantoverde Oxide Dump Leach : The increase is due to the application of new mine designs for Celso, Kuroki and Montecristo pits along with lower cut-off grades.
Mineral Tenure: Los Bronces: As per the latest Life of Mine Plan, the development of the Los Bronces Open Pit will require a modification to the Environmental Permits EIA Process as of 2030.
This in accordance with the current limits approved in the EIA-LBDP 2007 RCA N 3159.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2014 at the following operations: El Soldado, Los Bronces, Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Copper Resources: A test of reasonable eventual economic extraction is applied through consideration of an optimised pit shell.
Materials outside the optimised shell that have potential of eventual economic extraction via underground means are not included in the Mineral Resource statement.
Mineral Resources are quoted above variable cut-off grades not lower than 0.2 %TCu.
Los Bronces Sulphide Flotation and Sulphide Dump Leach : The overall decrease is due to updated economic assumptions leading to conversion of resources to reserves and new drilling information.
Mantos Blancos Oxide Dump Leach : The decrease is due to due to removal of material for which metallurgical test work is outstanding.
The Dump Leach Resources are comprised primarily of two major components, Mercedes Dump and Este Dump, split as follows: Este Dump Inferred: 54kt Contained Metal 30.2 Mt at 0.18 %ASCu.
Mercedes Dump Measured: 2kt Contained Metal 1.0 Mt at 0.18 %ASCu, Indicated: 17kt Contained Metal 10.0 Mt at 0.17 %ASCu, Inferred : 72kt Contained Metal 38.6 Mt at 0.19 %ASCu.
Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : The increase is due to new drilling information at Rebosadero, Quisco and Montecristo areas and the transfer of oxide material from the Mantoverde Development Project to the Mantoverde operation as a result of a change in the pit design.
Mantoverde Oxide Dump Leach : The increase is due to changes in economic assumptions lower cut-off grade applied.
Mining method: OP Open Pit.
TCu Total Copper, ASCu Acid Soluble Copper.
Los Bronces Sur previously known as San Enrique Monolito and Los Bronces Underground previously known as Los Sulfatos are part of Anglo American Sur.
Mantoverde Development Project is part of Anglo American Norte.
West Wall is a Joint Venture with Glencore.
EXPLANATORY NOTES Quellaveco Ore Reserves: A minimum cut-off of 0.30 %TCu is applied to determine Ore Reserves.
The increase is due to a new mine plan which incorporates increase plant throughput and a new cut-off grade.
Quellaveco Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.3 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell.
The decrease is due to a conversion of resources to reserves in a new mine plan.
Mantoverde Development Project Sulphide Flotation : Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.35 %TCu cut-off.
Mantoverde Development Project Oxide Flotation : Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.1 %ASCu Dump Leach or 0.2 %ASCu Heap Leach and less than 20 %CaCO cut-off.
The increase is due to declaration of resources in new areas mainly in the Mantoverde Fault area with additional resources in the 3 Mantoruso, Quisco and Celso areas.
West Wall: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.3 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell.
Los Bronces Sur San Enrique Monolito : To align with the location of the deposit within the Los Bronces mining district, San Enrique Monolito will be referred to as Los Bronces Sur going forward.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
Los Bronces Underground Los Sulfatos : To align with the location of the deposit within the Los Bronces mining district, Los Sulfatos will be referred to as Los Bronces Underground going forward.
The reported resources include mineralisation inside a 1% nominal copper grade cut-off envelope down to the current drillhole depths of 1,000 metres below surface.
Audits related to the generation of the Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2014 at the Mantoverde Development Project.
