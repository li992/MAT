The fair value of the unquoted investments held by the Company are based on the published NAV of the underlying investments in AllBlue Limited and AllBlue Leveraged Feeder Limited.
On the basis that the significant input to the fair value is observable and no unobservable adjustments are made to the valuations, the Company categorises all these investments as Level 2.
The quoted investments held by the Company, the ICS Funds, are in an active market with a directly observable price.
The Company therefore classifies this investment as Level 1 in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.
