1.1 Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below for the years ended 30 September 2014 and 30 September 2013.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations collectively IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Note 1.20 gives further details relating to the Groups critical accounting estimates.
At the date of approval, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2014: f IFRS 9 Financial Instruments classification of financial assets and financial liabilities f Amendments to IFRS 11 accounting for acquisition of Interests in Joint Operations f Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation f IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers f Amendments to IAS 27 equity method in separate financial statements f Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture f Improvements 2014 annual improvements to IFRSs: 20122014 These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the policies set out in the statutory financial statements of Zoopla Property Group Limited for the year ended 30 September 2013, with the exception of the application of certain new and revised accounting standards inthe period.
The new and revised standards and interpretations that have been adopted and a description of their impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements is provided below.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 replaces the parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that deal with consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that an investor has control over an investee when i it has power over the investee: ii it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and iii has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
All three of these criteria must be met for an investor to have control over an investee.
Previously, control was defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The adoption of IFRS 10 has had no material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 is a new disclosure standard and is applicable to entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and or unconsolidated structured entities.
In general, the application of IFRS 12 has resulted in slightly more disclosures in the financial statements.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements.
The scope of IFRS 13 is broad: the fair value measurement requirements of IFRS 13 apply to both financial instrument items and non-financial instrument items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value e. g. net realisable value for the purposes of measuring inventories orvalue in use for impairment assessment purposes.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal or most advantageous market at the measurement date under current market conditions.
Fair value under IFRS 13 is an exit price regardless ofwhether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
The adoption of IFRS 13 has had no material impact on the financial statements.

Accounting policies continued 1.3 Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries together, the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company: f has the power over the investee: f is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee: and f has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries sold are included up to the effective date of disposal.
During the year the Group was subject to restructuring prior to Admission on the London Stock Exchange.
Zoopla Property Group Plc was inserted atthe top of the Group as the new parent company, with the former parent, ZPG Limited formerly Zoopla Property Group Limited, becoming a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Zoopla Property Group Plc through a share-for-share exchange.
Such Group reorganisations areoutside the scope of IFRS 3.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 8, Management has used its judgement to develop a relevant and reliable accounting treatment, applying the principles of merger accounting under the Companies Act 2006.
Under this method the share capital and share premium reflect that of Zoopla Property Group Plc.
The 2013 comparatives have been disclosed on the basis that Zoopla Property Group Plc was in existence from the beginning of the prior year.
2013 comparatives are based on those of the previously existing Group as presented in the consolidated financial statements of Zoopla Property Group Limited now ZPG Limited for the year ended 30 September 2013.
The difference between the net assets of ZPG Limited recognised as an investment by Zoopla Property Group Plc at the date of restructuring and the value of the shares issued within share capital has been recognised within equity as amerger reserve.
The brought forward merger reserve and retained earnings represent those of the previously existing Group.
1.4 Going concern The financial position of the Group shows a positive net and current asset position with significant cash resources and high cash generation.
Furthermore, the Group continues to generate both positive adjusted EBITDA and profit after tax.
As a consequence, the Directors believe thatthe Group is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the historical financial information.
1.5 Revenue Revenue represents amounts due for services provided during the period, net of value added tax VAT, with the VAT liability being recognised atthe date of invoice.
The main sources of revenue are subscriptions from estate agents agency revenue and developers developer revenue, in respect of properties advertised on Group websites.
They are recognised over the period of the subscription.
Revenue from other services other revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
1.6 Operating leases Leases are classified as operating leases as substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group.
Thetotal rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over thelease term.
1.7 Finance income and costs Finance income represents interest receivable on cash and deposit balances.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using theeffective interest method.
Finance costs represent interest charged on bank loans and overdraft balances.
Finance costs are recognised on an accruals basis using theeffective interest method.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost.
As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable costs andthe estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items.
The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions in accordance with IAS 37.
Subsequent costs to repair or service a previously recognised item of property, plant and equipment are expensed when incurred as they donotprovide future economic benefit to the organisation.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful economic lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Fixtures and fittings over 35 years Computer equipment over 25 years Leasehold improvements over the lease term The Directors review the residual values and useful economic lives of assets on an annual basis.
In 2014 the Group purchased fixtures and fittings and computer equipment as part of the business relocation to a new head office.
The Directors believe that the economic life of these assets is five years.
This has been reflected in the policy above.

Accounting policies continued 1.9 Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3.
The consideration foreach acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued bythe Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value on the acquisition date except deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
1.10 Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between consideration paid and fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever the Directors have an indication that it might be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit with its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of estimated fair value and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are based on the value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by Management covering a five year period.
They reflect Managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows beyond the five year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
A growth rate of 3% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity.
The growth rate has been determined using long-term historical growth rates of the goodwill and intangible assets and Managements expectation of future growth.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 12%.
1.11 Intangible assets Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged tothe consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as follows: Domain names 5 years Databases 510 years Customer relationships 5 years Computer software 3 years 1.12 Research and development The Group incurs expenditure on research and development in order to develop and improve new and existing property websites and products.
Expenditure includes the staff costs of the technical team.
Research expenditure on planning new websites or products and obtaining new technical knowledge is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed when incurred unless they meet certain criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs whereby research findings are applied to creating a substantially enhanced website or new product are only capitalised once the technical feasibility and the commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated and they can be reliably measured.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Once the new website or product is available for use, subsequent expenditure to maintain the website or product, or on small enhancements tothe website or product, is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
1.13 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each statement of financial position date, the Directors review the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that this increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Accounting policies continued 1.14 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are not interest bearing and are designated as loans and receivables.
They are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts.
This is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
An impairment allowance is made for trade receivables.
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
When a trade receivable is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are designated as other financial liabilities.
They are recognised at their carrying amount which is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Groups Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments and are recognised at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Repurchase ofthe Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.
1.15 Current tax Current income tax, including UK income tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
1.16 Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: f the initial recognition of goodwill: f the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and f investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference anditisprobable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which thedifference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date andareexpected to apply when the deferred tax assets are recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities andthedeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: f the same taxable Group company: or f different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
1.17 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the period end date, and are discounted to present value where the impact ismaterial.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in finance costs.
Dilapidation provisions are recognised based on Managements best estimation of costs to make good the Groups leasehold properties at the end of the lease term.
The Group recognises a restructuring provision when there is a detailed formal plan in place and when it has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring, either by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.
The provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring and not those associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.
1.18 Employee benefits: defined contribution benefit scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The pension charge represents the amounts payable by theGroup to the fund in respect of the period.

Accounting policies continued 1.19 Share-based payments The Group provides equity-settled share-based incentive plans whereby Zoopla Property Group Plc allows certain employees of its subsidiary ZPG Limited to acquire its shares via an employee benefit trust.
The Group also issues warrants over shares in Zoopla Property Group Plc to anumber of the Companys estate agent members, allowing them to acquire shares in exchange for the estate agent members making their property listings available for inclusion on the Companys websites.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and members are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
Thefair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions and includes the impact of non-vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are set out in Note 21.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each statement of financial position date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result ofthe effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss suchthat the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate.
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model, including the Black-Scholes valuation model where appropriate.
The measurement inputs for each scheme include the share price on the measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on a statistical analysis of daily share prices, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates based on government-backed securities.
Details of the inputs used under each scheme are set out in Note 21.
Prior to the Groups Admission to the London Stock Exchange the Group granted rights over shares of ZPG Limited.
Following Admission on 23June 2014 Zoopla Property Group Plc grants rights over its equity instruments to employees and estate agent members of ZPG Limited.
These are accounted for as equity-settled transactions by the Group, recognising the expense within profit and loss for the year and a corresponding credit to equity.
Within the Company accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc equity-settled share options granted directly toasubsidiary are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments charge for the period and is recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to equity.
A number of shares are held in Trust in order to settle future exercises of the Groups share incentive schemes.
Details of the trusts are included inNote 21.
Shares held in trust are treated as a deduction from equity.
Employers national insurance contributions are accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%.
The amount accrued is based on the market value of the shares at 30 September 2014 after deducting the exercise price of the share option.
1.20 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The Groups Management makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk ofcausing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within future periods are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles The Group holds goodwill and intangibles on the statement of financial position in respect of business acquisitions made.
Acquired intangibles include acquired domain names and customer relationships.
The Group is required to review these assets for impairment.
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of impairment of intangible assets should be recorded requires an estimation of the recoverable value, which represents the higher of fair value and value in use, of the relevant cash-generating unit.
The value in use calculation requires Management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, discounted using a suitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred.
A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses andthe discount rate applied to those cash flows.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of different share-based payment schemes.
These are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that willeventually vest.
The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of Companys shares at the grant date, thediscount rate, expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected option lives.
In respect of share options granted to employees, the number of options that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the number ofemployees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market-based performance conditions being satisfied.
Management regularly performs atrue-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Management is also required to make a judgement on the number of warrants expected to vest based on whether or not the estate agent member is expected to meet their contracted requirements over the vesting period.

Accounting policies continued 1.21 Non-GAAP performance measures In the analysis of the Groups financial performance certain information disclosed in the financial statements may be prepared on a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide amore appropriate measure of the Groups underlying business performance.
The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Groups financial performance year-on-year.
However, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP measures adopted by other companies.
The key non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are: f Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items Note 3. f Adjusted basic EPS which is defined as profit for the year excluding exceptional items divided by the weighted average number of shares inissue for the period Note 11.
2. Business and geographical segments The Board of Directors has been identified as the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The monthly reporting pack provided to the Board toenable assessment of the performance of the business has been used as the basis for determining the Groups operating segments.
Whilst the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of the business at a revenue stream level: administrative expenses, finance income and costs, and income tax are all monitored on a centralised basis.
Accordingly, there is no profitability information below the Group level and thus there is a single operating segment.
The Group focuses its internal management reporting on the following activities: f agency revenue, which represents property advertising services to estate agents and lettings agents on the Groups websites: f developer revenue, which represents property advertising services to new home developers on the Groups websites: and f other revenue, which predominantly represents overseas property advertising services, display advertising on the Groups websites and dataservices.
Assets and liabilities are also managed on a centralised basis and are not reported to the chief operating decision maker in a disaggregated format.
All material revenues are generated from within the UK.
The following table analyses the Groups revenues as described above: 2014 2013 000 000 Agency 62,986 51,613 Developer 8,547 5,719 Other 8,697 7,166 Total revenue 80,230 64,498 3.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is used by Management as a key measure to monitor the Groups business and the Directors believe it should be disclosed onthe face of the income statement to assist in the understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
The Group defines EBITDA as profit or loss for the period before income tax expense or income, finance income, finance costs, and depreciation and amortisation.
Adjusted EBITDA is arrived at by making adjustments for costs and profits which Management believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items would include costs associated with business combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal, and similar items of a non-recurring nature together with reorganisation costs and similar charges.
This is further adjusted for share-based payment expenses which are comprised of charges relating to i warrants issued to certain of the Groups members in order to establish a critical mass ofproperty listings on the Groups platform: and ii employee incentive plans which are aimed at retaining staff and aligning employee objectives with those of the Group.
The Directors consider that excluding these non-cash charges in arriving at adjusted EBITDA gives a more appropriate measure of the Groups underlying financial performance.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or bank counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting infinancial loss to the Group.
The exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Groups most significant customer accounts for 598,000 2013: 279,000 of the trade receivables carrying amount.
The Groups customer base is large, so there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
There were only three customers at 30 September 2014 with individual debtors balances in excess of 5% of the total gross trade receivables balance 2013: one.
The Directors therefore consider the credit risk from trade receivables tobe low.
Standard credit terms range from 15 to 30 days from the date of invoice.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although it does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
The Groups trade receivables are stated net of an impairment allowance.

The credit risk associated with bank and deposit balances is mitigated by the use of banks with good credit ratings.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the period end was equal to the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Group to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash as they fall due.
Management regularly reviews performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient cash funds are available to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups revenue streams are largely subscription based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion, allowing it to effectively service working capital requirements.
Furthermore, the Group is debt free and cash generative and therefore it has adequate funds in place for any unforeseen events.
