REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED The performance periods run for three years from 1 April in each year and conclude on 31 March three years later and are exercisable on the attainment of certain performance criteria detailed on page 50.
The range of exercise dates are 1 June 2014 to 1 June 2023.
The LTIP, issued in 2011, which vests in June 2014, will not achieve the EPS target but will achieve 49.6 per cent of the TSR measure giving a share award of 24.8 per cent.
Of the original award, as shown above, 75.2 per cent will therefore lapse.
The options granted in the year are exercisable between 1 June 2016 and 1 June 2023 and are equivalent to 100 per cent of each Executive Directors base salary.
The share price at the time of issue was 1,127p.
If the minimum performance was achieved the EPS element would give 25 per cent and the TSR element would give 30 per cent: overall 27.5 per cent of the grant would be awarded.
If this was the case Mark Bottomley would receive 9,212 shares, Jim Brisby 8,277, Adam Couch 13,530, Martin Davey 14,602 and Bernard Hoggarth 7,480.
