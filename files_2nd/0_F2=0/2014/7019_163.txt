The UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 23% from 24% with effect from 1 April 2013.
Further phased reductions in the UK tax rate to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 21% from April 2014 were substantively enacted in the Finance Act 2013.
These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 21,532,000 2013: 22,739,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,143,000 2013: 3,025,000 of which only 671,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
At 29 March 2014 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 479,000 2013: 550,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
