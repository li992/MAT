The address of the registered office is 37 Carr Lane, Hull, HU1 3RE.
The nature of the Groups operations is described within the Strategic report on pages 7 to 9.
02 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting The consolidated and Parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
There were no new standards, amendments and interpretations that were adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2014 that were material to the Group, with the exception of the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised.
This standard replaces the interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and expected return on pension scheme assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 have been restated to apply this standard and the net impact has been an additional charge of 2.7 million to profit before tax in the income statement, see note 28 for further detail.
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not yet been applied in preparing these financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect or material impact on the financial statements ofthe Group.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations on the effective date will not have a significant impact on the Groups financial results.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its undertakings made up to 31 March 2014.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation.
Where a company has ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess ofthe cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Partnerships are controlled when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the partnership so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the KCOM Central Asset Reserve Limited Partnership and its undertakings made up to 31 March 2014.
The results of new partnership undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation.
Where a company has ceased to be a partnership undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker CODM.
The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the KCOM Group PLC Board of Directors.
As described in note 4, the Board assessed that Kcom, Smart421 and Eclipse brands are aggregated together and reported as the Kcom segment.
The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function are reported respectively in the KC segment and PLC segment.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value-added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities, as described below.
TheGroup bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics ofeach arrangement.
Revenue from calls is recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the time the call is made over the Groups network.
Revenue from rentals isrecognised evenly over the rental period.
KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 69 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 02 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition continued Revenue from product sales is recognised at the point of effective transfer of risk and reward.
Revenue from production of directories is recognised atthe point when the directory is published.
For large long-term annuity and multiple element customer contracts the Group is able to distinguish between the installation and the in-life service phases of a contract.
Revenue is allocated based on the fair value of the consideration which represents the market value of such services, or amounts per contracts, and will be recognised on the following basis for each phase: I installation within this phase revenue relating to resources and services is accounted for on a stage of completion basis where revenue is recognised with reference to the proportion of total costs incurred to date.
Revenue related to equipment is accounted for based on the point ofeffective transfer of risks and rewards shipment : and I in-life service revenue for this phase is recognised in line with the obligation to provide service as dictated by customer contracts.
Pre-contract costs, such as bid costs, on key contract wins are expensed as and when incurred.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised in the accounting period in which services are rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion ofthe total services to be provided.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide better understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature oramount.
In particular costs associated with organisational restructuring, costs and provisions associated with onerous contracts, profits or losses onthe sale of an operation and one-off pension costs and credits are treated as exceptional items.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fairvalue of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Development costs An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups internal development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: I an asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : I it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and I the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which itis incurred.
Research costs are expensed to the income statement as and when they are incurred.
Customer and supplier relationships Contractual customer and supplier relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
The contractual customer and supplier relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the relationship.
These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Technology and brand Technology and brand acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets and include managements estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by the acquired businesses.
Software Software comprises computer software purchased from third parties and also the cost of internally developed software.
Computer software purchased from third parties and internally developed software is initially recorded at cost.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the criteria detailed above is met.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
KCOM Group PLC 70 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 02 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer and supplier relationships up to 8 years Technology and brand up to 10 years Software up to 5 years Development costs 3 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Network infrastructure and related equipment included within exchange equipment and external plant is recorded at cost including labour costs directly attributable to the cost of the network construction.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight-line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings and improvements period of lease Exchange equipment 10 years External plant 10 to 20 years Vehicles, other apparatus and equipment 3 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Depreciation of network infrastructure and related equipment is provided for from the date the network comes into operation.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term ofthe relevant lease.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
They are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life for example, goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Costs include raw materials and, where appropriate, direct overhead expenses.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy orfinancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off are credited against operating expenses in the income statement.
KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 71 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 02 Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet, unless a right of offset exists.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax payable is currently based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and or items that are never taxable or deductible.
TheGroups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised generally for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets andliabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced or increased to the extent that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly to equity.
In this case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognised at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts istheir quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly inother comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised inthe income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
Ifa hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement inthe period.
Foreign currency translation These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
KCOM Group PLC 72 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 02 Accounting policies continued Leasing and hire purchase commitments Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over theperiods of the leases and hire purchase contracts.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Bank borrowings and issue costs Bank borrowings are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument tothe extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Borrowings are carried subsequently at amortised cost and any differences between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Pensions Defined contribution Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution money purchase scheme are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using a building block approach, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are recognised in equity and presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The current and past service costs of the scheme the increase in the present value of employees future benefits attributable to the current or prior periods are charged to the income statement in the period.
The cost or benefit of committed settlements and curtailments is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest cost of the scheme the expected return on scheme assets, less interest on scheme liabilities is recognised intheincome statement in the period to which it relates.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Employee share schemes and share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and discretionary long-term incentive schemes, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and long-term incentive schemes are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met, or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity settled share-based payments granted is measured using either the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo model, depending on the terms under which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance criteria not being met.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP under which employees have the option to purchase shares in the Company each month and offers employees free matching and partnership shares on a sliding scale of between 1:3 to 2:1.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense over the period of any applicable service condition, or immediately when no service condition exists.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividendsare approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 73 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 02 Accounting policies continued Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
03 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment of non-current assets Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use and or the estimated recoverable amount of the assetderived from the business, or part of the business, CGU, to which the non-current asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, by applying an appropriate discount rate to the timing and amount of future cash flows.
The Directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows applicable to the CGU, based on current budgets and forecasts, and extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and operating costs.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
Post-employment benefits The Group operates two defined benefit schemes.
All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised.
As detailed within the accounting policies note, in accordance with IAS 19, all actuarial gains and losses have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
For all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from independent qualified actuaries.
In performing these valuations, judgements, assumptions and estimates have been made.
These assumptions have been disclosed within note 28.
04 Segmental analysis Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the KCOM Group PLC Board that are used to make strategic decisions.
The chief operating decision-maker of the Group is the KCOM Group PLC Board.
The Board considers the performance of the four brands andthe PLC function in assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources.
These are the Groups operating segments.
The KC brand addresses the needs of our Hull and East Yorkshire customers and the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands serve enterprise, public sector organisations and small business markets across the UK.
The Board assessed that the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands have similar profiles offering similar products and services, similar production anddistribution processes and are operating in a consistent regulatory environment.
In line with IFRS 8, the Eclipse, Kcom and Smart421 brands areaggregated together and reported as the Kcom segment for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The remaining brands of KC and the PLC function arereported respectively in the KC segment and PLC segment.
This reporting is also consistent with the reporting to the KCOM Group PLC Board.
The comparative results have been restated for changes in IAS 19 Employee benefits.
See note 28 for further details.
PLC includes Public Company central and share scheme expenses, inter-segment eliminations and the costs, excluding current and past service costs, associated with the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and the related assets and liabilities.

KCOM Group PLC 78 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 12 Earnings per share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following numbers of shares and earnings: 2014 2013 Consolidated Number Number Weighted average number of shares For basic earnings per share 507,645,664 506,268,452 Share options in issue 5,704,438 6,273,766 For diluted earnings per share 513,350,102 512,542,218 1 Restated 2014 2013 000 000 Earnings Profit attributable to owners of the parent 38,770 35,845 Adjustments Exceptional items 588 2,310 Tax on exceptional items 135 760 Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent 38,317 37,395 2014 2013 Consolidated Pence Pence Earnings per share Basic 7.64 7.08 Diluted 7.55 6.99 Adjusted basic 7.55 7.39 Adjusted diluted 7.46 7.30 1.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in trust.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the exceptional items net oftaxation and dividing this adjusted figure by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in trust.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive ordinary shares.
The dilutive potential ordinary shares are in the form of share options.
A calculation has been done to determine the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and forecast cash flows.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
Growth rates reflect long-term growth rate prospects for the UKeconomy.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the current operating budget approved by the Directors which covers a five year period and an appropriate extrapolation of cash flows beyond this.
The cash flow forecasts assume revenue and EBITDA growth in line with our strategic priorities.
The carrying amount of goodwill of 85,272,000 2013: 85,272,000 has been allocated across multiple CGUs as follows: CGUs 000 Eclipse 7,862 Kcom 72,324 Smart421 5,086 At 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014 85,272 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 81 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 14 Goodwill continued The discount rate and growth rate in perpetuity used for value in use calculations are as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate pre-tax % 10.5 11.3 Growth rate in perpetuity % 2.0 1.5 The goodwill which has been allocated to the Kcom CGU is considered significant in comparison with the Group's total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the Kcom CGU has been determined using an internal value in use calculation.
Given the materiality of goodwill allocated to this CGU, together with the relative headroom derived by the calculations, sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key assumption used in the value in use calculations.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Kcom CGU exceeds its carrying value by 31 million.
The key assumption to which this calculation is most sensitive is the forecast net cash flows into perpetuity of 135 million.
Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this assumption shows that a reduction in the net cash flows into perpetuity of 23% would need to arise before any impairment would be triggered.
For the other CGUs, management has considered the level of headroom resulting from the impairment tests.
Where appropriate, further sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU.
The analysis has indicated that no reasonably possible changes in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of the business to exceed its recoverable amount.
As at 31 March 2014 and 2013, based on these valuations, the recoverable value of goodwill required no impairment.

KCOM Group PLC 84 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 19 Trade and other receivables continued Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2014 000 At 1 April 2013 2,065 Written off in the year 994 Unused amounts reversed 365 Amounts provided for in the year 783 At 31 March 2014 1,489 The majority of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in Sterling.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables for which an allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations.
It was assessed that a portion of the impaired balance is expected to be recovered.
These relate to a number of independent customers of whom there is no recent history of default.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 03 months 4,720 4,971 36 months 3,756 1,198 6 months 518 126 8,994 6,295 20 Trade and other payables Consolidated Parent company 2014 2013 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 Current Trade payables 40,257 39,096 Corporation tax 1,391 651 Other taxes and social security costs 5,178 4,915 Other payables 3,461 4,478 Accruals 53,467 45,736 Deferred income 25,954 26,795 Total 129,708 121,671 Non-current Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings 2,865 801 Total 2,865 801 Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of current liabilities approximates to their fair value.
Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings are unsecured and have no fixed date of repayment.
However, the subsidiary undertakings have confirmed that none of the amounts are due within one year.
Interest at market rates is charged on amounts due to subsidiary undertakings due after more than one year, except for amounts due to dormant entities where nil interest is charged.

KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 26 Financial instruments and risk management The Groups principal financial instruments during the year comprised bank loans, cash on short-term deposits, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations, to manage the interest rate risk arising from its sources of finance and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as short-term receivables and payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to interest, liquidity and foreign currency risk.
Where appropriate the Group will take action, in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy, to minimise the impact on the business of movements in interest rates and currency rates.
The Group only enters into derivative instruments with members of the banking group to ensure appropriate counterparty credit quality.
Liquidity risk The Group keeps its short, medium and long-term funding requirements under constant review.
Its policy is to have sufficient committed funds available to meet medium-term requirements, with flexibility and headroom to make minor acquisitions for cash if the opportunity should arise.
The Groups bank facilities were refinanced in June 2014 to replace existing facilities.
These bank facilities comprise a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 200.0 million, provided by a group of five core relationship banks.
The facility matures in June 2019.
The Group considers that this facility will provide sufficient funding to meet the organic and inorganic investment needs of the business.
In addition, short-term flexibility of funding is available under the 10.0 million overdraft facility provided by the Groups clearing bankers.
The net debt position of 88.2 million at the beginning of the financial year has decreased during the year to net debt of 75.0 million.
The Group generated positive cash flow after investing activities of 44.0 million for the year 2013: 24.7 million.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
Notional interest is included for the period from the year end up to the contractual maturity date of the debt, calculated on the amount of debt drawn down at the year end.

The weighted average fixed interest rate payable including margin was 3.90% 2013: 3.60%.
The weighted average rate of current interest rate swaps in place at the year end was 1.63% excluding margin.
Maturity dates of the current interest rate swaps are all July 2015 and reflect the forecast profile of net debt over the period.
The weighted average period over which the interest rates are fixed is 1.3 years 2013: 2.3 years.
Interest rate exposures will continue to behedged in accordance with the Treasury Policy.
KCOM Group PLC 88 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 26 Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest rate risks continued The impact of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points is shown in the following table: 2014 2013 000 000 Reduction in profit before tax 150 282 Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity The sensitivity of profit before tax is calculated based on floating rate borrowings at the balance sheet date, after deducting floating rate financial assets and amounts hedged into fixed rates by interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk Cash flow exposure The Groups only major foreign currency risk arises due to the purchase of equipment invoiced in US Dollars.
Whenever possible the Group resells this equipment in US Dollars.
The remaining exposure is managed principally through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in order to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows and gross margin.
The Group has also some Euro cash flows but these are not material on a net basis and are not hedged.
Net asset exposure The Dollar denominated trading described above results in a balance sheet exposure since debtor days are longer than creditor days.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge this exposure.
If Sterling strengthened by 5% against both the US Dollar and the Euro this would reduce net assets at the balance sheet date by 43,719 2013: 69,808. Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to business and retail customers.
Credit ratings of institutions which hold the Groups financial assets are regularly monitored to ensure they meet the minimum credit criteria set by the Board through the Group Treasury Policy.
At the year end all the institutions holding the Groups financial assets were rated AAor higher by Standard and Poors.
The credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set and the utilisation of credit limits monitored regularly.
Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Group had financial assets of 9.4 million at the year end 2013: 15.7 million, comprising cash on overnight money market deposits and cash atbank.
This attracts floating rates of interest.
The currency profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 was: 2014 2013 000 000 Currency Sterling 7,955 13,616 US Dollar 909 1,871 Euro 577 232 Total 9,441 15,719 Foreign currency cash balances are held on a short-term basis to fund cash flow requirements in these currencies.
At the year end 1.3 million 2013: 1.3 million of cash collateral was held by Barclays in respect of a bank guarantee given under OFCOMs Funds forLiabilities regulations.
Financial liabilities The currency and interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial borrowings at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 was: 2014 2013 Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 24,417 60,000 84,417 43,937 60,000 103,937 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the year end were 115.0 million 2013: 95.0 million.
Interest on amounts drawn under the committed borrowing facility is based on the relevant LIBOR plus margin.
KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 26 Financial instruments and risk management continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The mark to market value of the interest rate swaps and forward contracts at 31 March 2014 was a liability of 1.8 million 2013: 3.2million.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for by adjusting the interest cost on the floating debt return.
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is obtained from third party sources.
The movement in mark to market value is reflected in reserves and is shown below: 000 Hedging reserve 31 March 2013 2,363 Movement in the year 1,377 31 March 2014 986 The effectiveness of the interest rate swaps was tested quarterly throughout the period, and at the year end, and all are considered to be effective cash flow hedges.
There are no other significant differences between the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities and their book value.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: I quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : I inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 : and I inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, support the growth of the business and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet lesscash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is shown in the table below and is calculated as equity as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
2014 2013 000 000 Net debt 74,976 88,218 Total equity 85,153 82,642 Total capital 160,129 170,860 Under the Groups 200 million revolving credit facility the Group is required to comply annually with certain financial and non-financial covenants.
The Group is required to maintain a minimum interest cover ratio and a maximum net debt: EBITDA ratio.
Both financial covenants were tested and complied with throughout the year and at the year end.
The Board monitors both covenant compliance and net debt performance on a regular basis.
27 Financial commitments Authorised future capital expenditure and financial investment amounted to: Consolidated 2014 2013 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 6,354 1,146 Intangible assets 2,575 270 Total 8,929 1,416 KCOM Group PLC 90 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Financial statements 27 Financial commitments continued The Group as lessee The future aggregate minimum lease rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: Consolidated 2014 2013 000 000 Leasehold buildings: within 12 months 3,871 3,730 in 1 to 5 years 9,600 8,405 after 5 years 7,217 6,363 Total 20,688 18,498 Plant and equipment: within 12 months 899 1,777 in 1 to 5 years 1,618 3,665 Total 2,517 5,442 None of the Groups lease arrangements include any contingent rent payments and there are no renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
There are also no restrictions imposed by the Groups lease arrangements.
28 Retirement benefit obligation consolidated Defined contribution schemes The Company operates defined contribution schemes, which are open to all eligible employees.
Contributions charged to the income statement inrespect of defined contribution schemes amounted to 3.9 million 2013: 3.7 million.
Defined benefit schemes The principal defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2014 was the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme, which is a funded scheme and provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the assets of the Group in trustee administered funds.
The Company operates also a second funded defined benefit scheme, the Kingston Communications Data Pension Scheme.
Both schemes areclosed to both new members and future accrual.
The defined benefit schemes are operated in the UK under the same regulatory frameworks.
Both of the schemes are final salary pension schemes, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the schemes, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with theretail price index.
In addition to this inflationary risk, the schemes face the same risks, as described below.
All of the benefit payments are from trustee administered funds.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the Group and the Trustees.
The Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Group and scheme participants in accordance with the schemes regulations.
Parent company KCH Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, is responsible for all obligations and liabilities of the schemes.
An equivalent liability has been provided in the accounts of KCH Holdings Limited.
The Parent company provides a guarantee to both defined benefit schemes, whereby if KCH Holdings Limited is unable to meet its obligations to the schemes, such obligations would be met by the Parent company.
No liability has been recognised in respect of the guarantee at 31 March 2014 2013: Nil.
Most recent valuations The most recent formal valuation for the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme was at 31 March 2013.
The main long-term financial assumptions used in that valuation were: Per annum % Rate of return on scheme assets 3.90 Rate of future salary inflation 2.90 The most recent formal valuation for the Kingston Communications Data Pension Scheme was at 31 March 2013.
The main long-term financial assumptions used in that valuation were: Per annum % Rate of return on scheme assets 4.10 Rate of future salary inflation 2.90 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 28 Retirement benefit obligation consolidated continued Funding Asset-backed partnership On 24 March 2014, the Group reached an agreement with the Trustees to provide further funding of the Schemes current deficit position through theasset-backed Partnership the Partnership that had been previously established during the year ended 31 March 2013.
As part of this agreement, a loan note of 20.0 million was secured over the Group network assets.
As partner in the Partnership, the pension schemes are entitled to an annual income distribution of 1.6 million, rising in line with the Consumer Price Index CPI capped at 5% over a potential period of 15 years.
The total value of this income distribution to the Schemes is 16.0 million which provided an immediate improvement to the funding deficit.
As part of the agreement with the Trustees, there is no requirement for the Group to pay any deficit payments in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the pension schemes in the Partnership does not represent a plan asset for the purpose of the Groups consolidated accounts.
The distribution of the Partnerships profits to the pension schemes are reflected as pension contributions in these Group accounts on a cash basis.
Employer contributions for the year ended 31 March 2014 The disclosures below are for the two schemes combined.
Contributions into the two defined benefit schemes during the year were as follows: 2014 2013 000 000 Deficit payments 788 575 Existing committed deficit recovery payments due over the financial years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 are 2.0 million per annum.
Main financial assumptions 2014 2013 per annum per annum % % RPI inflation 3.40 3.40 CPI inflation 2.40 2.40 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.40 2.40 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.30 4.60 Expected return on plan assets 5.56 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables, which allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The effect of these tables are that: I a future pensioner aged 65 at retirement will live on average to age 89.0 2013: 89.0 if they are male and on average to age 91.2 2013: 90.9 ifthey are female: and I a current pensioner aged 65 will live on average to age 87.1 2013: 87.2 if they are male and on average to age 89.1 2013: 89.1 if they are female.
The defined benefit obligation reflects the assumption that 20% 2013: 20% of deferred members will transfer out of the scheme over its life.
Where such transfers take place, the value of such transfers are assumed to be 0% 2013: 0% above the current IAS 19 value for individual members.
The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality.
The sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation deficit to changes inthe assumptions is as follows: Impact on the retirement benefit obligation Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease RPI inflation 0.1% 11.3% 10.9% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.1% 12.8% 13.6% Mortality 1 year 24.5% 24.5% The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation deficit to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit liability calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation deficit recognised in the Group balance sheet.

KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2013 14 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2014 28 Retirement benefit obligation consolidated continued Adoption of IAS 19 revised The revised employee benefit standard introduces changes to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits.
The standard also requires net interest expense to be calculated as the product of the net defined benefit liability and the discount rate as determined at the beginning of the year.
The effect of this is to remove the previous concept of recognising an expected return on plan assets.
The effects of the changes on prior years previously disclosed figures are as follows: 2013 as Impact of previously IAS 19 Restated stated revised 2013 000 000 000 Income statement EBITDA 74,567 2,015 72,552 Depreciation and amortisation 19,612 19,612 Finance costs 4,589 652 5,241 Share of profit of associates 10 10 Profit before taxation 50,376 2,667 47,709 Taxation 12,478 614 11,864 Profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent 37,898 2,053 35,845 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Profit for the year 37,898 2,053 35,845 Other comprehensive income: remeasurements of retirement benefit obligations 2,038 2,667 4,705 tax on items that will not be reclassified 979 614 1,593 Total items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 1,059 2,053 3,112 Total items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss 449 449 Total comprehensive income for the year 39,406 39,406 There is no impact on the balance sheet following the adoption of the revised IAS 19.
In the cash flow statement, as the revised standard has noimpact on Group net debt, the reduction in profit above is offset by an increase in working capital.
The impact of the revised standard on basic EPSwas a 0.41 pence reduction.
29 Other commitments and contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities existed at 31 March 2014 and at 31 March 2013 in respect of guarantees given by the Parent company on behalf of subsidiary undertakings, together with contingencies arising in the normal course of the Groups business in respect of overdraft facilities.
None of these guarantees are considered material in the context of the net assets of the Group.
