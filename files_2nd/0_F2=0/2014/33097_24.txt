PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS Unaudited Our portfolio provides a secure income stream, with a weighted average unexpired lease term of eight years, and opportunities for growth.
The portfolio was 3.6% reversionary at 31 December 2014, with reversion at the UK and French portfolios of 1.2% and 10.0% respectively.
Assuming that leases are renewed or re-let and rent reviews are agreed at current ERVs an estimated 17.0 million of additional annual income could be secured from the portfolio by the end of 2017.
As explained in the Financial Review on page 51, management reviews the performance of the business including the Groups share of joint ventures on a proportionally consolidated basis, but excludes the Groups interest in premium outlets through investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
This is because the Group has less day-to-day involvement and the outlets centre sector has different operational characteristics compared with the Groups property portfolio.
The information in the following tables has been prepared on this basis.

Our business model for developments is to use a combination of in-house staff and external advisers.
The cost of external advisers is capitalised to the cost of developments.
The cost of staff working on developments is generally expensed, but may be capitalised subject to meeting certain criteria related to the degree of time spent on and the stage of progress of specific projects.
Including the net one-off restructuring charge of 3.0 million shown above as operating costs increases the cost ratio to 24.3%.
Further details on the restructuring charge are in the Financial Review on page 52.
