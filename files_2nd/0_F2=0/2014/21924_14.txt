48 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that IFRS have been adopted by the European Union.
The functional currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The financial statements are also presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
a Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : Effective for periods International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS beginning on or after IAS 27 Reissued as IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements as amended in 2011 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2014 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 The Company does not believe that there will be a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from the adoption of these standards interpretations.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no Company Statement of Comprehensive Income has been prepared.
The profit for the year for the Company is 49,208,000 2013: 98,918,000. d Presentation of Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Company is registered as a UK Investment Company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
Additionally, net revenue is the measure which the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect items reported in the Group and Company Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and, to some extent, future events and actions, the Groups actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
Unquoted equity investments that the Group holds are not traded and, as such, the prices are more uncertain than those more widely traded securities.
The unquoted investments are valued by reference to valuation techniques approved by the Directors and in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEVC guidelines as described in note 1 i.
49 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report 02 15 Investment Review 16 27 Governance 28 43 Financial Statements 44 78 f Income Dividends receivable are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from fixed interest securities is included in revenue on a time apportionment basis using the effective interest method.
g Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses have been charged to revenue except as follows: the management fee has been allocated 30% 2013: 50% to revenue and 70% 2013: 50% to capital within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income: expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment are recognised within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a capital item: and expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
h Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were enacted or substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
i Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
The Groups business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Groups Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Group as held at fair value through profit or loss and are described in the financial statements as investments held at fair value.
All investments are designated as held at fair value upon initial recognition and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which for listed investments is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the IPEVC guidelines.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
Foreign exchange gains and losses for fair value through profit or loss on investments are included within the changes in their fair value.
50 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued j Movements in fair value Changes in fair value of investments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as capital items.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and at the bank and short-term deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
l Dividends payable Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
m Foreign currency translation Transactions in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Items that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
n Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and have been allocated 30% 2013: 100% to revenue and 70% 2013: nil to capital.
This complies with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which require the finance costs of the Debenture Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in the same proportions as the management fee.
o Debenture pricing 1 8 The 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 is valued at amortised cost under the effective interest method and secured by a floating charge over all assets 1 8 of the Company.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance of the 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Further details of the Debenture Stock are disclosed in notes 12 and 17. p Capital Reserve Capital reserve other The following are taken to this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments: amortisation of issue expenses: costs of share buybacks: exchange difference of a capital nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
Capital reserve investment holding gains The following are taken to this reserve: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
q Merger Reserve The merger reserve represents the share premium on shares issued on the acquisition of Selective Assets Trust plc on 13 October 1995. r Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being the investment business.
Consequently, no business segmental analysis is provided.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Risk management policies and procedures The investment objective of the Group is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Groups financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
The Group may also enter into derivative transactions which comprise forward foreign exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Groups investing activities and quoted options on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Group has not used derivatives during the current financial year as part of its investment strategy.
The Board sets out its investment policies on page 30.
The Board and Investment Manager consider and review the risks inherent in managing the Groups assets which are detailed below.

It is not the Groups usual policy to hedge this risk.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Pounds Sterling upon receipt.
During the year, the Company did not enter into any forward foreign exchange contracts.
There were no open forward foreign exchange contracts as at 30 September 2014.
Over the year, the Pound Sterling strengthened against the Groups principal investing currencies, the US Dollar by 0.11% 2013: 0.28%, the Canadian Dollar by 8.84% 2013: 4.76% and the Euro by 7.28% 2013: weakened 4.69%.
A 5% rise or decline of the Pound Sterling against foreign currency denominated i. e. non Pound Sterling assets and liabilities held at the year end would have decreased increased the total return and net asset value by 35,891,000 2013: 35,369,000.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments in fixed-interest rate securities: the level of income receivable on cash deposits: the interest payable on variable rate borrowings: and the fair value of the Companys long term debt.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short-term borrowings being used when required.
The Debenture Stock, issued by the Company as a planned level of gearing, pays a fixed rate of interest and is carried in the Companys Balance Sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence, movements in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the Companys share price and discount premium, which is not likely to be material.
Further information on the Debenture Stock is shown in note 12.
60 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The exposure at 30 September of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates fixed interest rates At At 30 September 30 September 2014 2013 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 5,994 7,126 If the above level of cash was maintained for a year, a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would increase decrease the revenue return and net assets by 60,000 2013: 71,000.
000 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 25,779 1 8 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2023 fair value based on market prices 18,525 7,254 The impact of holding the Debenture Stock at fair value would be to reduce the Group's net assets by 3,589,000.
The maturity dates and the nominal interest rates on the investments held at fair value through profit or loss are shown in the Investment Portfolio on page 13.
The weighted average effective interest rate on these investments is 0.15% 2013: 0.20%.
The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 25,779,000 2013: 130,048,000.
A 1% increase decrease in relevant market interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the portfolios value by approximately 58,000 2013: 378,000, all other factors being equal.
The fair value of the Companys Debenture Stock at the year end was 18,525,000 2013: 18,525,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the applicable interest rates would be expected to decrease increase the fair values of the Debenture Stock by approximately 1,198,000 2013: 1,208,000, all other factors being equal.
Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the Investment Portfolio is set out on pages 12 and 13.
If the fair value of the Groups investments at the year end increased or decreased by 10%, then it would have had an effect on the Groups capital return and equity equal to 83,878,000 2013: 84,635,000.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments, if necessary.
Unlisted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
The risk is taken into account by the Directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.

Credit risk Credit risk is mitigated by diversifying the counterparties through whom the Investment Manager conducts investment transactions.
The credit standing of all counterparties is reviewed periodically with limits set on amounts due from any one counterparty.
The total credit exposure of the Group at the year end as shown on the Balance Sheet and Investment Portfolio was 34,998,000 2013: 145,522,000.
The total credit exposure represents the carrying value of fixed income, cash and receivable balances and totals 34,998,000 2013: 145,522,000, as detailed in the table on page 58.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Except for the Groups Debenture Stock measured at amortised cost as shown below, the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group are either carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value investments, or the Balance Sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, cash at bank and due to brokers.

The fair value of the Groups unquoted investments is measured by the Directors using valuation methodologies in accordance with IPEVC guidelines.
62 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The tables below set out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the year end, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at 30 September 2014 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 810,388 2,616 813,004 Fixed interest bearing securities 25,779 25,779 836,167 2,616 838,783 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss at 30 September 2013 000 000 000 000 Equity investments 710,123 6,183 716,306 Fixed interest bearing securities 130,048 130,048 840,171 6,183 846,354 The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 49.
There have been no transfers during the year between Levels 1 and 2.

63 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report 02 15 Investment Review 16 27 Governance 28 43 Financial Statements 44 78 Capital management policies and procedures The structure of the Companys capital is described in note 14 and details of the Companys reserves are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity on page 45.
The Companys capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value: through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, regularly monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
These reviews include: the level of gearing, which takes account of the Groups position and the Investment Managers views on the market: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from last year.
The Group is subject to externally imposed capital requirements: a as a public company, the Company is required to have a minimum share capital of 50,000: and b in accordance with the provisions of sections 832 and 833 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company, as an investment company: i is only able to make a dividend distribution to the extent that the assets of the Company are equal to at least one and a half times its liabilities after the dividend payment has been made: and ii is required to make a dividend distribution each year such that it does not retain more than 15% of the income that it derives from shares and securities.
These requirements are unchanged since last year and the Group has complied with them at all times.
Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments In June 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT, and in early November 2007 HM Revenue & Customs decided not to contest that ruling.
The Board is taking steps to reclaim such Back VAT on investment management fees as it can and has recovered 3,603,575 up to the date of this report.
While most of the Back VAT has now been recovered, the Company is taking further steps to recover Back VAT and interest, but does not anticipate any further significant recovery in the near term.
At 30 September 2014, the Group had no financial commitments 2013: nil.
At 30 September 2014, the Group had no contingent liability in respect of any investments carrying an obligation for future subscription or underwriting commitments 2013: nil.
At 30 September 2014, the Group had a contingent liability pursuant to an Indemnity given to Caledonia Investments plc Caledonia in respect of sums received from Caledonia by way of repayment of VAT the VAT Refund paid by the Company between 1991 and 1995 on investment management fees to Caledonia.
This Indemnity is against any amounts of VAT including any interest or penalties Caledonia is liable to repay to HM Revenue & Customs in respect of the VAT Refund, together with all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by Caledonia in enforcing its rights under the Indemnity.
The Companys liability under the Indemnity shall not exceed the amount of the VAT Refund received from Caledonia which amounted to 619,178 including simple interest of 263,337.
