2 Accounting policies continued The Group chose not to adopt any of the above standards and interpretations early.
Other than the impact of IAS 19 revised, no significant net impact from the adoption of these new standards is expected.
3 Segmental information The Group is organised into four operating segments, and information on these segments is reported to the chief operating decision maker CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
The CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The four operating segments are: the UK & Ireland, Europe & Middle East, the Americas and Asia & Africa.
The segments derive their revenues from the same range of products and services being the provision of Hospital Sterilisation Services HSS, Applied Sterilisation Technologies AST, and Healthcare Services.
The CODM monitors the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit, being operating profit excluding the impact of amortisation on acquired intangibles and non-recurring items.
Segment information is presented below.
During the period, management undertook a review of the allocation of certain reseller customers between the segments.
Some customers were reallocated between segments and consequently the comparative data presented for previous periods has been restated.
The table below analyses the Groups revenues from external customers between the three principal product service groups: 2014 2013 000 000 Healthcare Solutions 179,663 171,893 Hospital Sterilisation Services 85,771 82,073 Applied Sterilisation Technologies 115,019 107,282 380,453 361,248 IFRS 8 Operating segments requires the Group to disclose information about the extent of its reliance on its major customers.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 23% 2013: 24% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2012, and further reductions to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2015 were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
This will reduce the Company's future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 30 March 2014 has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax per the income statement as follows: Restated 2014 2013 000 000 Profit before tax 42,893 37,971 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 23% 2013: 24% 9,865 9,113 Effect of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes and other permanent differences 553 94 Different tax rates on overseas earnings 592 373 Overseas withholding tax 116 Adjustment in respect of prior years 2,735 1,550 Effect of change in UK corporation tax rate 629 296 Changes in the recognition of tax losses 866 465 Tax charge for year 8,628 7,081 Restated to reflect the amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits see note 2.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as shown in the table below.
This table also provides the assumptions used by management in assessing the carrying value of these amounts.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a segment to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
An impairment results where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
During the year the goodwill for each segment was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2013: nil impairment charges resulting.
In addition, as described in the Audit Committee report on page 52, a more detailed review has been carried out on certain Group assets, focusing on whether these assets required impairment.
Following the review, no impairment was judged to be required.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash flows for a period of five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash flows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each segment the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets to which each segment is dedicated.
Discount rates have been calculated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the segment.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The discount rates applied to each specific CGU are set out in the table above.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management reflecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each segment the key assumptions are discount rate, long term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis as at 30 March 2014 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
Other intangibles includes capitalised software, 709,000 was transferred from property, plant and equipment during the period.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no land and buildings assets pledged to secure banking facilities or other loans granted to the Group 2013: land and buildings assets with a carrying value of 5.7 million.
At 30 March 2014, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 2.4 million 2013: 1.8 million.
Included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is 805,000 2013: 805,000 of capitalised interest.
At the end of the period the Group transferred a recently vacated property from property, plant and equipment to current assets as an asset held for sale.
Immediately prior to this reclassification, the asset carrying value was adjusted to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
The asset was held at a carrying value of 2,765,000.
Other transfers include intangible assets of 709,000 reclassified as other intangible assets.

The new Revolving Credit Facilities were used to refinance the Groups previous syndicated loan facility of 160 million, which had been due for repayment on 15 January 2012.
The new Revolving Credit Facilities comprise one facility of 105 million, and a second facility of 130 million.
Both Facilities are unsecured and attract a floating rate of interest, although fixing arrangements have been entered into as described in note 19.
On 1 June 2012, the Group entered into an additional Revolving Credit Facility with a club of banks.
The additional Revolving Credit Facility was used to preserve the Groups debt headroom following recent acquisitions.
The additional Revolving Credit Facility has largely the same terms as the 2011 Revolving Credit Facility and has not been utilised since inception.
On 13 September 2012, the Group issued a US Private Placement note with a value of 20.6 million.
The Private Placement note is due for repayment in September 2019.
Certain Euro-denominated loans outside the main facilities totalling 0.5 million are secured by mortgages on certain Dutch freehold properties.
The loans attract both floating and fixed rates of interest.
At 30 March 2014, the Group had available 53.1 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
In addition, the Group had undrawn overdraft and other uncommitted facilities including additional amounts of Private Placement notes totalling 39.3 million which it expects to renew during the financial year.

19 Financial instruments Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, with the exception of contingent consideration which is measured by a Level 3 valuation method.
a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to fluctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 30 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to fix the interest charge on $35.0 million of its bank debt.
The swap arrangements cover: Debt covered Fixed rate Expiry $35 million 2.5% 31 March 2016 Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expense consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in fixing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 830,000 2013: 1,385,000 in current liabilities and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to fixed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and one year forward rates: Increase decrease Effect on profit after in basis points tax and equity 000 2014 32 32 261 261 2013 23 23 273 273 98 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 19 Financial instruments continued c Foreign currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro and between Sterling and the US Dollar.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the proportion of interest cost in each currency is consistent with the proportion of earnings in that currency.
By arranging its affairs in this manner, the Group seeks to ensure that there is no disproportionate impact on its results as a result of exchange rate movements.
During the 12 months to March 2014 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro weakened by 3% in comparison with the 12 month average to March 2013.
A 3% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2014 would have resulted in increased adjusted operating profit of 0.8 million 2013: a 6% weakening, which would have led to a decrease of 1.3 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 3% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
During the 12 months to March 2014 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has strengthening by 1% in comparison to the 12 month average to March 2013.
A 1% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2014 would have resulted in reduced adjusted operating profit of 0.0 million 2013: a 1% strengthening, which would have led to a reduction of 0.0 million.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 1% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect.
Where the Group subsidiaries make significant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds net Euroand US Dollardenominated loans in UK companies totalling 76.3 million and 67.1 million respectively 2013: 93.6 million and 73.0 million respectively.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 76.3 million of the Groups Euro-denominated net assets of 133.2 million and 67.1 million of the Groups US Dollar-denominated net assets of 76.6 million 2013: 93.6 million of 118.7 million and 73.0 million of 85.2 million.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a gain of 2.0 million 2013: loss of 2.6 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer specific credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Given these factors and based on extensive past experience, the Group believes that its financial assets are of good credit quality.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 89,963,000 2013: 85,876,000 being the total trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the world.
No single customer or top 10 customer grouping accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables.
The Group has in place an insurance policy to cover the majority of its Healthcare Solutions UK export customers.
Credit quality of trade receivables and impairment losses At the balance sheet date, the ageing of trade receivables was: 2014 2013 Group 000 000 Current 35,697 41,311 130 days overdue 9,276 9,996 3160 days overdue 2,269 2,053 6190 days overdue 1,382 1,888 More than 90 days overdue 2,073 609 50,697 55,857 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 99 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Financial instruments continued Financial assets are reviewed for impairment at the balance sheet date and a full provision for impairment is made against trade receivables that are not considered to be recoverable.
The total provision against trade receivables at the period end was 645,000 2013: 626,000, of which the majority relates to amounts more than 90 days overdue.
No further analysis has been provided for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables from Group companies, other trade receivables and other financial assets as there is limited exposure to credit risk and no provisions for impairment have been recognised.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Details of the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities are given in note 18.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are: i. to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, and ii.
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by a pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk and b ensuring that returns on new investment programmes will maintain or increase shareholder returns.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares, if required.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the periods ended 30 March 2014 and 31 March 2013.

The Group has deferred tax assets of 4,802,000 2013: 5,480,000 in respect of tax losses that have not been recognised as their recoverability is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where appropriate.
In March 2013, the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The change was enacted on 2 July 2013 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred tax liability which has been included in the figures included above.

The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account Total Shareholder Return TSR as a market-based performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The inputs into the fair value models are as follows: 2014 2013 Weighted average share price 11.16 9.05 Weighted average exercise price 0.01 0.01 Expected volatility 17.60% 21.70% Expected life in years 3.0 3.0 Risk free rate 0.62% 0.33% Dividend yield 1.93% 2.10% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years at the date of grant.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 109 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group contributes towards a number of defined contribution and stakeholder schemes.
The assets of these schemes are administered by trustees and held in funds independent from the assets of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 4,709,000 2013: 4,037,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes At the start of the year, the Group participated in six defined benefit pension schemes: three in the UK, one in the Netherlands, one in Germany, and one in Switzerland.
In addition, the Group participates in a multi-employer scheme in the Netherlands.
These schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: market investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk currency risk and longevity risk.
They do not expose the Group to any unusual scheme-specific or Group-specific risks.
With effect from 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits issued by the IASB in June 2011.
This amendment has been applied retrospectively, resulting in the restatement of certain previously reported figures.
In the year ended 31 March 2013, financing income in the income statement decreased by 875,000 with a corresponding increase in the actuarial gain recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The related deferred tax credit in the income statement increased by 201,000, with a corresponding reduction in the deferred tax credit recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The impact of these changes in the year to 30 March 2014 is not materially different from these figures.

Each is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet long-term pension liabilities for past and present employees as at 31 March 2012.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on the final pensionable salary prior to leaving active service, and is linked to changes in inflation up to retirement.
The schemes are subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005.
This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial Reporting Council, set out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension schemes in the UK.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of the trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
A full actuarial valuation of each scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding of the schemes is agreed between the Group and the trustees in line with those requirements.
These in particular require the surplus deficit to be calculated using prudent, as opposed to best estimate actuarial assumptions.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2012, which were carried out by a qualified independent actuary, have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2014.
There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this period's disclosures compared with the previous period's disclosures.
The present value of scheme liabilities is measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The value calculated in this way is reflected in the net liability in the balance sheet as shown above.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected earnings increases.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the scheme liabilities, whose calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings increases.
In assessing this figure for the purpose of these disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory revaluation of benefits up to retirement.
A further measure of the scheme liabilities is the solvency basis, often taken as an estimate of the cost of buying out the benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities rather than the Company continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
All actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in the year in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income OCI.
The Company has reviewed the implications of the guidance provided by IFRIC 14 and has concluded that it is not necessary to make any adjustments to the IAS 19 figures in respect of an asset ceiling or Minimum Funding Requirement as at 30 March 2014.
Allowance has been made for a pension increase exchange being introduced as an option at retirement in the scheme during the year.
The corresponding impact has been recognised as a curtailment gain in the income statement.

The scheme assets do not include investments issued by the Group nor any properties occupied by the Group.
The overall expected rate of return on the scheme assets has been based on the average expected return for each asset class, weighted by the amount of assets in each class.
Key weighted average assumptions used by the actuary and the Directors for the significant pension schemes: 2014 2013 % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.2 3.2 Inflation 3.1 2.9 Discount rate for liabilities 4.2 4.2 The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, salary growth risk, mortality risk and longevity risk.
A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities.
This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future P&L accounts.
This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
