33 Sale of Imaging IP assets and reversal of asset impairment CSR announced that it would cease investment in future COACH products in December 2013, resulting in a $76.9 million impairment charge, against the goodwill and non-current assets allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit CGU within the consumer segment, in the income statement for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2013.
On 8 June 2014, CSR completed the sale of certain Imaging intellectual property IP assets associated with its camera business, together with the team devoted to their development.
The sale was for a total consideration of $44.0 million, subject to post-closing conditions.
The people and assets transferred were part of the camera-on-a-chip COACH operations.
Once it became certain that IP associated with the COACH business and allocated to the Cameras CGU was to be sold in June 2014 this triggered an assessment of the carrying value of assets allocated to this CGU.
The outcome of this assessment was to reinstate the noncurrent assets, other than the goodwill, associated with the Camera CGU, at a carrying amount equivalent to that if the assets had not been impaired $23.3 million and reverse the impairment charges made against those non-current assets in December 2013.
This resulted in a credit of $23.3 million within operating profit for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2014.
Following the disposal on 8 June 2014, CSR no longer holds any assets associated with the COACH business.
