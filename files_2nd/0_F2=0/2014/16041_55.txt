As a consequence of this restructuring the Directors determined that the goodwill and other intangibles associated with the PTS CGU Grouping Headroom Average per annum Discount Rate Long-term Growth Rate branches that are rebranded as City Plumbing Supplies should be reallocated to the City Plumbing Supplies CGU.
Therefore 65m of goodwill has been transferred from the PTS CGU to the City Plumbing Supplies CGU.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU 14.

For most of the CGU groupings, given the At 31 December 2013 297.0 7.2 105.6 409.8 prudence already built into the Groups five-year plans and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
