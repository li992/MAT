The growth in the valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2014 over the rebased value was 12.7%.
This increase is a product of the return from the portfolio, the reduction in the discount rate and UK corporate tax rates partly offset by the lowering of deposit rate assumptions and forex movements.
Return from the Portfolio The return from the portfolio of 126.5m 2013: 97.5m represents a 9.5% 2013: 8.9% increase in the rebased value of the portfolio.
As expected, the majority of this return 8.3%, being the average was generated by the unwinding of the weighted average discount rate used to value the portfolio in the year.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2014 27 Section 2: Strategic Report continued The remaining 1.2% 2013: 0.5% of incremental value arose as a result of the net positive contributions from a number of factors including: Contributions from new investments: Acquisitions made at, or above, the portfolio discount rate: Gains from disposals: Net operational out performance including savings from portfolio insurances: UK actual inflation in the year being lower than the 2.75% p. a. valuation assumption: and Impairment of an operational road project.
Fair value for each investment is derived from the application of an appropriate discount rate to the investments future cash flows to give the present value of those cashflows.
The Investment Adviser exercises its judgment in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the detailed concession life financial models produced by each Project Company.
Cash flows are adjusted where necessary to include the Groups economic assumptions as well as any specific operating assumptions.
Discount Rates The main method for determining the appropriate discount rate used for valuing each investment is based on the Investment Advisers knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
When there are limited transactions or information available, and as a second method and sense check, a bottom up approach is taken based on the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield and an appropriate risk premium.
The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase and market participants appetite for these risks.
The discount rates used for valuing the projects in the portfolio are as follows: Discount rate 31 March 2014 30 September 2013 31 March 2013 Range 7.8% to 11.0% 7.9% to 10.0% 8.0% to 10.0% Phase Operational phase 8.2% 8.3% 8.4% Construction phase 8.9% 9.0% n a Portfolio weighted average 8.2% 8.3% 8.4% The average discount rate reflecting market pricing for an operational asset has been assessed as 8.2% down 0.2% from the prior year reflecting market conditions discussed in Section 2.6 above.
An analysis of the weighted average discount rates for the investments in the portfolio analysed by territory is shown below: 31 March 2014 31 March 2013 Movement Discount rate Country Long-term Government Risk premium Discount rate Bond yield UK 3.4% 4.8% 8.2% 8.4% 0.2% Canada 2.9% 5.0% 7.9% 8.1% 0.2% France 3.0% 7.6% 10.6% n a n a Holland 2.5% 5.8% 8.3% 8.6% 0.3% Ireland 3.2% 5.8% 9.0% 10.0% 1.0% Portfolio 3.3% 4.9% 8.2% 8.4% 0.2% In the UK, there is sufficient market data on discount rates and hence the risk premium is derived from this market discount rate for operational social and transportation infrastructure investments less the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield.
For Canada, France, Holland and Ireland, where there is less market data, the bottom up approach is adopted to determine discount rates.
The Board discusses the proposed valuation with the third-party valuation expert to ensure that the valuation of the Groups portfolio is appropriate.
28 H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2014 As long-term Government Bond yields in the UK, Canada, France and Holland are currently low, this is reflected in higher country risk premium, which includes an allowance for increases from these historically low yields.
An analysis of the movements in the weighted average risk free rate and risk premium for the social and transportation infrastructure assets is shown below: Year ending 31 March 2014 31 March 2013 Movement Government Bond yield 3.3% 2.9% 0.4% Risk premium 4.9% 5.5% 0.6% Discount rate 8.2% 8.4% 0.2% The 0.2% reduction is attributable to a more competitive environment for social infrastructure assets.
While there is a steady supply of new investment opportunities, new market entrants, attracted by the favourable risk-adjusted returns, have driven prices upwards, and hence caused discount rates to fall during the year.
Valuation Assumptions and Sensitivities Apart from the discount rates, the other key economic assumptions used in determining the Directors valuation of the portfolio are: 31 March 2014 31 March 2013 1 UK RPI and RPIx 2.75% p. a.
2.00% p. a. UK short-term 1.0% p. a. to March 2018 1.0% p. a. to March 2017 Deposit Rates UK long-term 3.5% p. a. thereafter 3.5% p. a. thereafter CAD GBP 0.54 0.65 Foreign Exchange Rates EUR GBP 0.83 0.84 Tax Rate UK corporation tax 21% 23% 1.
Retail Price Index or Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest payments.
These assumptions are judgements in determining the valuation and, as in previous years, the Company prepares certain key sensitivities, which are set out in Note 4 to the accounts.
In the UK, RPI and RPIx were 2.5% for the year ending March 2014.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK inflation of 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx, the same assumption as for the prior year.
The March 2014 forecasts for RPI out to December 2015 range from 2.6% to 4.2% from 24 independent forecasters as compiled by HM Treasury, with an average forecast of 3.3%.
Changing the assumption for future inflation by a 1.0% p. a. increase i. e. from 2.75% p. a. to 3.75% p. a. for the UK investments has the effect of increasing the forecast return from the portfolio from 8.2% being the weighted average discount rate to 8.8%.
As at 31 March 2014 cash deposits for the portfolio were earning interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum on average.
There is a consensus that UK base rates will remain low for an extended period, with a current median forecast for UK base rates in December 2015 of 1.2%.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK deposit interest rates are 1% p. a. to March 2018 and 3.5% p. a. thereafter.
This extends the period of 1% deposit interest rates as applied in the March 2013 valuation, which assumed 1% deposit interest rates to March 2017 and 3.5% thereafter.
These changes have reduced the portfolio valuation by approximately 5.7m and are included within the 12.1m aggregate increase in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
The UK corporation tax assumption for the portfolio valuation is 21%, which has reduced by 2% from 23% at March 2013, to reflect the current rate of UK corporation tax.
This change has increased the portfolio valuation by approximately 17.8m and is included within the 12.1m aggregate change in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
