c  The fair value amounts estimated on the date of grant relating to all options including conditional nil cost options and awards, were determined using the Black-Scholes and the Monte Carlo option-pricing models using the following assumptions: 2014 2013 Prudential SAYE Other Prudential SAYE Other LTIP TSR options awards LTIP GPSP TSR options awards Dividend yield % 2.40 2.73 Expected volatility % 21.91 20.77 23.64 24.27 Risk-free interest rate % 1.25 1.51 0.73 1.06 Expected option life years 3.77 3.46 Weighted average exercise price 11.55 9.01 Weighted average share price 13.18 14.02 11.80 11.85 Weighted average fair value 6.07 3.00 12.84 7.38 2.57 11.06 Compensation costs for all share-based compensation plans are determined using the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The compensation costs for all awards and options are recognised in net income over the plans respective vesting periods.
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options and awards other than the Prudential LTIP TSR for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of the LTIP TSR performance conditions.
These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.
For all options and awards, the expected volatility is based on the market implied volatilities as quoted on Bloomberg.
The Prudential specific at-the-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.
Risk-free interest rates are taken from government bond spot rates with projections for two-year, three-year and five-year terms to match corresponding vesting periods.
Dividend yield is determined as the average yield over a period of 12 months up to and including the date of grant.
For the Prudential LTIP TSR, volatility and correlation between Prudential and a basket of 18 competitor companies is required.
For grants in 2014, the average volatility for the basket of competitors was 23.4 per cent.
Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns between April 2011 and the valuation date.
Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and the components of the index.
Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.
