Significant accounting policies specific to one note are included with that note.
Accounting policies relating to non-material items are not included in these financial statements.
This section also includes new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their expected impact, if any, on the performance of the Group.
1.1 Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 9 March 2015.
Cairn is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH3 9BY.
Cairn prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis, unless accounting standards require an alternate measurement basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed either in the relevant accounting policy or in the notes to the financial statements.
The financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
The Groups financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the EU.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as they apply to accounting periods ended 31 December 2014.
Effective 1 January 2014, Cairn has adopted the following standards: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities IAS 27 amendment Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 amendment Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Adopting IFRS 11 has the most significance as the Groups material interests in oil and gas exploration and development licences are managed through joint arrangements with fellow partners.
Previously, the Groups interests in these arrangements were classified as jointly controlled assets and disclosed as joint venture balances in the notes to the appropriate financial statement line item.
Following implementation of IFRS 11, the Groups joint arrangements are all now classified as joint operations and the disclosures in the financial statements amended accordingly.
There was no impact on the results for the year as a result of adoption.
The following amendments to standards issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU have yet to be adopted by the Group: Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle effective 1 July 2014 The adoption of these amendments will have no material impact on Cairns results or financial statement disclosures.
There are no other standards or amendments issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU that will impact the Group.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
Where subsidiaries follow differing accounting policies from those of the Group, those accounting policies have been adjusted to align with those of the Group.
Inter-company balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, though foreign exchange differences arising on inter-company balances between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies are not offset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in any year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition while the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows to the date at which control passes from the Group.
108 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 1.1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued d Joint arrangements Cairn is a partner joint operator in oil and gas exploration and development licences which are unincorporated joint arrangements.
All of the Groups current interests in these arrangements are determined to be joint operations.
A full list of oil and gas licence interests can be found on pages 144 to 146.
Costs incurred relating to an interest in a joint operation are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies for oil and gas assets as appropriate see sections 2.1 and 2.2.
All of the Groups Intangible exploration appraisal assets and Property, plant & equipment development producing assets are related to interests in joint operations.
Cairns working capital balances relating to joint operations are included in Other receivables section 3.4 and Trade and other payables section 3.5.
Any share of finance income or costs generated or incurred by the joint operation is included within the appropriate Income Statement account.
e Foreign currencies These financial statements continue to be presented in US dollars US$, the functional currency of the parent.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the financial statements of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, US$, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non-US$ directly to reserves.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 109 Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets and Related Goodwill This section focuses on the assets in the Balance Sheet which form the core of Cairns business.
This section quantifies the financial impact of the operations for the year fully described in the Operational review on pages 22 to 27.
Included are details of the costs of multi-well programmes in Morocco and Senegal and the impairment reviews and tests performed on the Groups assets.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment testing on oil and gas assets Given the recent fall in oil prices which lowers the Groups short-term oil price assumption, Cairn has tested its oil and gas assets which contain discovered resources for impairment.
Remaining exploration assets are reviewed for indictors of impairment and tested where indicators are identified.
This is consistent with the Groups accounting policies.
The impairment tests resulted in an impairment of an asset in the North Sea and Greenland.
For details of the indicators and the subsequent impairment tests conducted on those assets, see section 2.1.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Impairment testing of Intangible exploration appraisal assets and Property, plant & equipment development assets Where an indicator of impairment is identified on an intangible exploration appraisal asset or a development asset, an impairment test is conducted in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The test compares either the carrying value of the asset or the carrying value of the cash-generating unit CGU containing the asset, to the recoverable amount of that asset or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset represents its fair value less costs of disposal.
Where there is a verifiable third-party arms-length transaction from which a market value can be obtained this market value represents the fair value.
In January 2015, Cairn completed the sale of a 10% working interest in the Catcher development and this transaction provides evidence of the fair value less costs of disposal of this asset at the Balance Sheet date.
Where there is no verifiable third-party arms-length transaction, the fair value less costs of disposal of an asset is calculated using discounted post-tax cash flow models.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions include: Short medium-term oil price based on a three-month average forward curve for three years from the Balance Sheet date: Long-term oil price of US$90 per boe escalated at 2.5% per annum: Reserve estimates of discovered resource 2P and 2C based on P50 reserve estimates: Production profiles based on Cairns internal estimates which are not materially different from those of the operators: Cost profiles for the development of the field and subsequent operating costs supplied by the operator and escalated at 2.5% per annum: and Discount rates of 10% for the Groups UK and Norwegian North Sea assets.
Impairment testing of goodwill The goodwill arising from past corporate transactions in the UK and Norwegian North Sea is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
As with the assets above, fair value less costs of disposal are based on discounted post-tax cash flow models where no recent third-party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The key assumptions are therefore consistent with those for testing intangible exploration appraisal assets.
Where resource is prospective, fair value represents the expected net present value of the prospect, risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, valuations of prospective resource are highly subjective.
110 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting policy Cairn follows a  accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
An indicator that one of the Groups assets may be impaired is most likely to be one of the following: There are no further plans to conduct exploration activities in the area: Exploration drilling in the area has failed to discover commercial reserve volumes: or Development proposals for appraisal assets in the pre-development stage indicate that it is unlikely that the carrying value of the exploration appraisal asset will be recovered in full.
In such circumstances the intangible exploration appraisal asset is allocated to any property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same cash-generating unit and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within the cash-generating unit, the excess of the carrying amount of exploration appraisal asset over its recoverable amount are charged immediately to the Income Statement.

Back costs received under the agreement are shown as disposals of US$20.5m.
Cairn had originally farmed-in to the three blocks during 2013.
During 2014, Cairn completed two exploration wells offshore Senegal: the FAN-1 and SNE-1 wells.
Results to date indicate that the SNE-1 well discovered commercial volumes of oil while further work is required to determine the commerciality of the FAN-1 discovery.
Capitalised costs of US$166.8m at 31 December 2014 include the cost of these wells.
Cairn, along with its partners in the joint operation, are preparing further exploration and appraisal programmes for submission to the Government of Senegal in May 2015, with a drilling programme due to commence in Q4 2015.
Atlantic Margin Other Africa: Morocco and Mauritania Cairn completed two exploration wells offshore Morocco in the current year.
The Foum Draa and Juby Maritime wells did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and both were plugged and abandoned.
US$53.2m of unsuccessful exploration costs were charged to the Income Statement in 2014.
Costs of US$107.4m incurred to 31 December 2013 were charged as unsuccessful costs in the prior year.
A third well in Morocco, offshore Western Sahara, the non-operated Cap Boujdour well, commenced drilling in December 2014.
The well failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons and costs to 31 December of US$46.9m were charged to the Income Statement in 2014 as unsuccessful exploration costs.
Work continued on the C-19 licence offshore Mauritania during 2014 with additions of US$2.9m in the current year 2013: US$27.0m.
Costs of US$30.5m remaining at the year end represent US$29.9m of Mauritania costs and US$0.6m of other costs.
Atlantic Margin Greenland and Republic of Ireland Cairn is actively seeking to farm-down the Groups interests in Greenland before undertaking any further exploration activities across the licence interests it holds.
Though Cairn remains encouraged by the Pitu prospect, with no firm plans for future exploration activity, the remaining costs of US$22.7m associated with the Greenland licences were fully impaired at the year end.
The costs of US$21.7m remaining at the year end relate to the Spanish Point appraisal prospect, offshore Republic of Ireland.
North West Europe UK and Norway UK and Norwegian North Sea Additions in the current year of US$108.8m 2013: US$160.5m relate to expenditure on exploration and appraisal wells drilled and new prospects added to the portfolio.
The Group added to its existing exploration portfolio through the acquisition of non-operated interests in the PL248c Grosbeak prospects in the Norwegian North Sea and through licences awarded under the latest rounds in both the UK and Norway.
During 2014, two exploration wells were completed in the North Sea.
Neither the UK Aragon well nor the Norwegian Atlas well discovered hydrocarbons.
Unsuccessful exploration costs of US$50.0m were charged to the Income Statement together with US$2.2m relating to other licences.
2013 unsuccessful costs of US$81.3m included costs of US$53.5m and US$18.6m relating to the Frode and Klara exploration wells in the Norwegian North Sea.
Following the two-well appraisal programme on the Skarfjell discovery which completed drilling operations in 2013, the interpretation of the well results concluded in the current year.
The appraisal wells confirmed the estimated reserve volumes of the discovery without materially increasing the future economic value of the field.
As the Skarfjell asset was initially recognised at fair value, it is unlikely that the costs relating to the appraisal wells will be recovered and costs of US$25.2m are charged as unsuccessful exploration costs in the year.
DECC approval of the Catcher FDP was received in June 2014.
Costs of US$148.4m were transferred from Intangible exploration appraisal assets to Property, plant & equipment development producing assets during the year.
A similar transfer of US$298.7m was made in 2013 following approval of the Kraken FDP.
Exploration costs remaining at the year end include the net book value of the Catcher satellite discoveries and exploration prospects and the Skarfjell discovery and associated satellite prospects.
At the year end, Cairn reviewed its intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment.
Impairment tests identified impairment on one of the Groups intangible exploration assets, resulting in a charge of US$24.2m to the Income Statement.
The 2013 year end impairment review identified an indicator of impairment on the Catcher asset.
The subsequent test resulted in an impairment charge of US$251.4m.
Norwegian Barents Sea Cairn has farmed-in to Block PL393B in the Barents Sea, which included the Ensis exploration well which completed in September 2014.
The well did not encounter any hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned.
Farm-in costs and additional costs incurred of US$17.4m were charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs.
No costs remain capitalised at the year end.
112 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 2.2 Property, Plant & Equipment Development Producing Assets Accounting policy Costs All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Costs of borrowings relating to the ongoing construction of development assets and facilities are capitalised during the development phase of the project.
Capitalisation ceases once the asset is ready to commence production.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Impairment Development producing assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at the Balance Sheet date.
Indicators of impairment for the Groups development producing assets include: Downward revisions of reserve estimates: Increases in cost estimates for development projects: or A decrease in the oil price or other negative changes in market conditions.
Impairment tests are carried out on each development producing asset at the Balance Sheet date where an indicator of impairment is identified.
The test compares the carrying value of an asset to its recoverable amount based on the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
Where the fair value less costs of disposal supports the carrying value of the asset, no value-in-use calculation is performed.
If it is not possible to calculate the fair value less costs of disposal of an individual asset, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated for the cash-generating unit containing the asset and tested against the carrying value of the assets and liabilities in the cash-generating unit for impairment.
Where an asset can be tested independently for impairment, this test is performed prior to the inclusion of the asset into a cash-generating unit for further impairment tests.
If the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is made.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.

A similar transfer of exploration costs for the Kraken field was made in 2013 upon receiving DECC approval.
In September 2014, Cairn entered into an agreement to farm-down 10% of the Groups 30% working interest in the Catcher development, satellite fields and surrounding exploration acreage to Dyas UK Limited Dyas.
Under the terms of the deal, Dyas will fund Cairns exploration and development costs in respect of the licences up to a cap of US$182.0m.
Final approval for the sale to Dyas was received in January 2015.
As the deal had an effective economic date of 1 January 2014, on completion, Cairn received a refund of costs of US$54.7m including US$36.5m received under the carry.
During 2013, Cairn agreed the sale of the Mariner asset in the UK North Sea to Dyas BV, receiving formal approval in December 2013.
The disposal of Mariner resulted in a US$24.7m loss to the Income Statement.

These commitments include Cairns share of the capital commitments of the joint operations themselves.
The capital commitments for intangible exploration appraisal assets relate to operations in Africa and the UK and Norwegian North Sea.
The capital commitments on Property, plant & equipment development producing assets relate to the North Sea development projects and include US$215.0m of capital commitments for the 10% share of Catcher which was farmed-down to Dyas in January 2015 section 6.1.
Dyas will be responsible for funding this in full.
Capital commitments for property, plant & equipment development producing assets include US$685.9m relating to two FPSO lease commitments due within the next eight years.
This includes US$119.7m of lease commitments on the 10% of Catcher which was farmed-down to Dyas as noted above.
The lease term for these assets has not yet commenced.
The Group has no further material capital expenditure committed at the Balance Sheet date.
2.4 Intangible Assets Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill Cairn allocates the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying cash-generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of cash-generating units representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit, or group of cash-generating units, within the segment is based on its fair value less costs of disposal, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the result of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

At 31 December 2014, the goodwill impairment test did not identify any impairment, with the carrying value of the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment being less than the recoverable amount of the underlying assets, principally the Catcher, Kraken and Skarfjell assets.
114 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 2.4 Intangible Assets Goodwill Continued The impairment of the Catcher asset in 2013 see section 2.1 reduced both the carrying value of the operating segment and its recoverable amount in equal measures.
The release of deferred tax provided on the Catcher asset, however, increased the carrying value of the segment in relation to the recoverable amount.
Additionally, the recognition of tax credits for field allowances to which the Kraken asset was eligible further increased the carrying value of the segment.
As a result, the recoverable amount of the assets could no longer support their carrying value and at 31 December 2013 the year end impairment test identified impairment and a charge of US$324.2m was recorded.
The remaining carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was supported by the fair value less costs of disposal of the Groups UK and Norwegian North Sea assets.
2.5 Sensitivity Analysis North West Europe oil and gas assets At 31 December 2014, impairment tests were conducted on the Groups North Sea exploration appraisal assets and development producing assets resulting in an impairment charge of US$24.2m.
An impairment test was also conducted on goodwill allocated to the North Sea Operating Segment.
No impairment of goodwill was identified.
For assets where the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal estimated using discounted cash flow modelling, the key assumptions used in determining the valuations are subjective such as the future oil price assumption, or reliant upon the performance of operational partners for delivering development projects on time and within approved budgets.
Cairn has run sensitivities on its long-term oil price assumptions at US$75 and US$70.
Cairn also increased the short-term period, where assumptions are based on the forward curve, from three to four years.
The impact of these changes on the carrying value of the Groups assets at the Balance Sheet date is summarised below: Decrease in Decrease in Intangible Property, plant exploration & equipment appraisal development Decrease in assets assets Goodwill US$m US$m US$m Short-term period increased from three to four years Decrease in oil price assumption to US$75 per boe 14.6 37.1 Decrease in oil price assumption to US$70 per boe 32.6 27.1 88.1 A Key Performance Indicator KPI for the Group is to ensure effective engagement with partners to progress the North Sea development projects on time and within budget.
Cairns base case asset valuations, used to estimate fair value less costs of disposal in impairment tests, assume this KPI is met.
With the value of the Catcher development asset supported by the sale to Dyas, Cairn has run sensitivities on the Kraken development asset, delaying the date of first oil production by up to 12 months and increasing costs by 10%.
The resultant fall in value would not impact the carrying value of any of the assets on the Groups Balance Sheet.
The Groups proved and probable and contingent reserve estimates are based on P50 probabilities.
P10 and P90 estimates are also produced but would not provide a reasonable estimate to be used in calculating the fair value of the Groups assets.
Cairns reserve estimates do not materially differ from those of the operators.
Other oil and gas assets At the year end, an impairment charge was recognised on intangible exploration assets in Greenland as noted in section 2.1.
These assets are fully impaired in accordance with IFRS and the Groups accounting policies and therefore there is no meaningful sensitivity analysis to provide.
There are no reasonable changes in assumptions that would lead to a material impairment of any of the Groups remaining assets in the Atlantic Margin.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 115 Section 3 Financial Assets and Working Capital Cairns liquid cash resources supported by the undrawn US$575.0m secured borrowing facility ensure the Group is fully funded to meet its current exploration and development programme despite the current restriction on the sale of shares in Cairn India.
This section focuses on those assets, together with the working capital position of the Group at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment of Available-for-sale Financial Asset The Groups 10% shareholding in Cairn India Limited, classified as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset, suffered a significant fall in value during 2014.
The size of the deficit was such that cumulative mark-to-market valuation movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and classified as an available-forsale reserve in equity, were recycled to the Income Statement as impairment.
The closing book value of the asset represents the quoted market price of the Groups residual holding.
Although Cairn is currently not able to sell its 9.8% stake, there is no restriction in the wider market where Cairn India Limited shares trade freely at this price.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: There were no key estimations or assumptions in this section.
3.1 Available-for-sale Financial Assets Accounting policy The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gains or losses that arise on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale assets are recycled through the Income Statement.
At each reporting date, the fair value of the financial asset is compared to the value at the date of its initial recognition for signs of a prolonged or significant deficit in the valuation, which would indicate impairment.
Where impairment is identified, cumulative losses recognised in Other comprehensive income are recycled to the Income Statement.
In the event of a subsequent recovery in the valuation of the asset, there is no reversal of impairment: any such post-impairment gains are recognised as a surplus through Other comprehensive income.
Any further impairment losses will be recognised through the Income Statement.

In January 2014, Cairn was contacted by the Indian Income Tax Department to provide information in relation to the year ending 31 March 2007.
While interaction with the Indian Income Tax Department continues, Cairn has been restricted by the Indian Income Tax Department from selling its shares in, or receiving dividends declared by, Cairn India Limited.
Prior to the restriction in January, the Company disposed of 12,048,836 shares in Cairn India Limited, recognising a gain of US$3.9m.
This includes prior year unrealised gains recycled from equity of US$5.1m.
The disposal of 0.6% shareholding leaves a residual 9.8% interest in Cairn India Limited.
At 31 December 2014, the value of the investment in Cairn India Limited had fallen to US$702.6m.
The significant accumulated deficit of US$194.3m from the date of a previous impairment was recycled to the Income Statement and recorded as impairment.

This section also includes details of the Group tax credits in the year and deferred tax assets and liabilities held at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Deferred taxation The deferred tax liability relating to the Groups investment in Cairn India Limited, classified as an available-for-sale financial asset, is provided on the assumption that any future disposal will result in a tax liability.
At the year end Cairn recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of UK North Sea oil and gas assets.
This deductible temporary difference represents eligible field allowances on the Kraken and Catcher assets, offset by other taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are not included in the impairment tests conducted on the Groups oil and gas assets.
However, at each reporting date, Cairn reviews the carrying value of deferred tax assets to assess whether taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise unused tax losses and allowances which give rise to the asset.
Cairn believes it is probable that UK North Sea assets will generate the taxable profits necessary to allow the temporary differences reflected in the deferred tax asset to be utilised in full.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Deferred taxation Deferred tax liabilities relating to UK and Norwegian North Sea assets are measured using the tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised, based on the conditions that existed at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets do not include additional field allowances that certain assets in the UK may qualify for in future periods, but which are subject to Government approval of respective field development plans which did not exist at the Balance Sheet date.
4.1 Segmental Analysis Operating segments Cairn holds a balanced portfolio of exploration and development assets focused in three geographical regions: North West Europe: the Atlantic Margin: and the Mediterranean.
The operations of the Group are organised on a country-by-country basis: countries form the Groups operating segments.
For management reporting purposes, operating segments are combined into regional business units.
Cairn monitors the results of each regional unit separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
The Groups Atlantic Margin exploration region contains two regional units.
Assets in Greenland and the Republic of Ireland are combined into one unit while the Groups African assets in Senegal, Morocco and Mauritania also form a separate unit.
The North West Europe regional unit holds the UK and Norway operating segments.
This region was previously reported as UK and Norwegian North Sea.
Currently the segment contains the Groups North Sea assets including the Skarfjell discovery in Norway and the UK Catcher and Kraken developments.
The Ensis prospect in the Norwegian Barents Sea is also included in this segment.
The results of the Mediterranean region are reported along with the Groups corporate assets within Other Cairn Energy Group.
The Mediterranean includes licences in Spain, France and Malta.

The current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for the year.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint operations where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

The UK main rate of corporation tax was 23% prior to 1 April 2014, and 21% from that date onwards.
The reduction in the tax rate from 23% to 21% has resulted in an average rate of corporation tax of 21.5% for the year ended 31 December 2014, as shown above.
The rate will reduce to 20% on 1 April 2015.
Special rates of tax apply to oil and gas activities in the UK and Norwegian North Sea operating segment.
The applicable UK statutory tax rate applying to North Sea oil and gas activities is 62% and the applicable Norwegian rate applying to oil and gas activities is 78%.

This includes the recognition in the year of a deferred tax credit to UK temporary differences in respect of non-current assets of US$71.2m 2013: US$211.9m, reflecting the eligibility to future field allowances on the Kraken and Catcher developments which will reduce future Ring Fence profits subject to Supplementary Charge.
The eligible field allowances were confirmed when DECC approved the Kraken field development plan in 2013 and the Catcher field development plan in 2014, and will be claimed when production commences.
A deferred tax asset has also been recognised in respect of Norwegian tax losses and other temporary differences of US$12.0m 2013: US$8.2m against a Norwegian deferred tax liability arising on temporary differences in respect of non-current assets.

Cairn commits to managing its tax affairs in a transparent and responsible manner and ensuring that all statutory obligations and disclosure requirements are met.
We aim to comply with both the letter and spirit of the law in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate, to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid, at the right time, within the right jurisdiction.
As the Group is currently at an early stage in the value creation cycle and the level of its exploration activities is high, there are currently no taxable profits in the UK.
Taxable profits in other jurisdictions are also minimal, and as a result cash payments of corporation taxes are currently low.
Cairns policy is to not enter into any artificial tax avoidance schemes and to build and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with all relevant tax authorities, based on honesty, integrity and proactive cooperation.
The Group aims for certainty in relation to the tax treatment of all items: however, we acknowledge that this will not always be possible, for example where transactions are complex and there is a lack of maturity in the tax regime in the relevant jurisdiction in which we are operating.
In such circumstances the Group will seek external advice where appropriate and ensure that the approach adopted in any relevant tax return is supportable and includes full disclosure of the position taken.

Foreign currency translation Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves.
Foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.

5.2 Capital Management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
Cairn manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, Cairn may buy back shares, make a special dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities see section 3.2 or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.

The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using a Monte Carlo model with the exception of the SIP awards which have been valued using a Black-Scholes model.
Awards in prior years were valued using a Monte Carlo model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a year represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that year.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group operates a number of share-based schemes for the benefit of its employees.
