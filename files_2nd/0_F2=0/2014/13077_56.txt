21 Pension and other Post-retirement Commitments Plan details The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups most significant defined benefit pension plan UK is a final salary plan, which closed to new entrants in 2005.
Trustees of the plan are appointed by the Group, active members and pensioner membership, and are responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The plan is funded by the payment of contributions to the plans Trust, which is a separate entity from the rest of the Group.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement plans in certain countries.
The major plan is in the US US Retiree Health Care Plan, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
This plan closed to new members in 2009.
A Benefits Committee of the plan is appointed by the Group, and is responsible for the governance of the plan, including paying all administrative costs and compliance with regulations.
The following table provides details of membership for all plans in the two principal territories: Plan details at last valuation date UK US Active Participants: Number of members 365 2,232 Proportion of funding liability 13% 32% Total pensionable salary roll 15.3m 57.2m Participants with deferred benefits: Number of members 5,949 2,814 Proportion of funding liability 29% 23% Total deferred pensions at date of leaving plan 18.7m 2.7m Participants receiving benefits: Number of members 6,902 4,044 Proportion of funding liability 58% 45% Total pensions in payment 41.7m 6.8m Full independent actuarial valuations are carried out on a triennial basis.
For the principal UK plan, the most recent valuation was carried out at 5 April 2013.
For the US plan, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2012.
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate the pension plan Technical Provisions deficit in the UK and Ireland over the next four years.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis and the current agreed contribution rate is 19.5% of pensionable salaries in the UK and nil in the US.
It is expected that contributions in 2015 will be 58m to the UK defined benefit plan and nil to the US Retiree Health Care Plan.
This will be reviewed after each triennial valuation is signed off by the Group and Trustee.
The Group considers that the contribution rates set at the last valuation date, and any future further contributions in excess of the contribution rate, will be sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will not increase significantly.
For the purpose of IAS19 the projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US plans, rolling forward the preliminary UK plan triennial valuation results at 5 April 2013 and the 1 January 2012 US plan valuation to 31 December 2014.
The UK plans have a weighted average duration of the deferred benefit obligation of 17.9 years 2013: 17.3 years.
