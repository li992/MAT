Governance Audit & Risk Committee report Significant issues related to the financial statements The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates and judgements.
Management prepares papers providing details on the key judgements and these are reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee also reviews reports from the external auditor on the half year and full year results, which provide an overview of the audit work undertaken and highlight any issues for discussion.
The significant issues considered in the year were: revenue recognition, specifically the timing of when to recognise revenue so that sufficient revenue is deferred to cover future obligations including claims handling accounting in respect of new customers acquired through the Endesa and Enel Sales Through Service channels the exceptional provisions required in respect of the UK issues including the remediation exercises the exceptional provisions required for the FCA fine and associated costs the carrying value of intangible assets specifically acquisition intangible assets and goodwill arising on the purchase of businesses and books of policies and customers The Committee addressed these matters using reports presented by management which set out the basis for the assumptions used.
All of the issues were also discussed with the external auditor and its views were taken into account.
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made are reasonable and appropriate disclosures have been included in the accounts.
