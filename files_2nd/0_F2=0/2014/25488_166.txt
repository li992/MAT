Derivative fi financial instruments The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include fi financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow, notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative fi financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash fl ows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.
