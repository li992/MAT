Asset Management principally comprises investment management including advisory services, equity products, fixed income securities, multi-asset investments, real estate and alternative asset classes such as commodities and private equity.
Wealth Management principally comprises investment management, wealth planning and banking services provided to high net worth individuals and charities.
The Group segment principally comprises the Groups investment capital and treasury management activities, insurance arrangements and the management costs associated with governance and corporate management.
Insurance activities comprise acting as an insurer to the Group, including the results of the captive insurer which provides reinsurance for certain activities of the Group.
Provisions for actual and potential claims that are within the insurance cover are consequently recorded in the Group segment, net of any recognisable external insurance asset.
If it is concluded that there is no insurance cover available or the insurance cover will not cover the charge in full, the actual or estimated cost in excess of the insurance recovery is transferred to the relevant operating segment.
The expected insurance recovery may be in excess of the amount that is allowed to be recorded under accounting rules.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that provided for internal reporting purposes to the Groups chief operating decisionmaker, the Chief Executive.
Operating expenses include an allocation of costs between the individual business segments on a basis that aligns the charge with the resources employed by the Group in particular business areas.
This allocation provides management information on the business performance to manage and control expenditure.

Revenue The Groups primary source of revenue is fee income from investment management activities performed within both the Asset Management and Wealth Management segments.
Fee income includes management fees, performance fees and transaction fees.
Management fees are generated through investment management agreements and are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of AUM.
The fees are recognised as the service is provided and it is probable that the fee will be received.
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods.
They are only recognised at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and it is almost certain that the fee will be received.
Revenue also includes other fees, principally transaction-based, which vary according to the volume of transactions.
Such fees are recorded as income as the service is provided and the receipt of income is almost certain.
Within Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity.
Interest income earned as a result of placing loans and deposits with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to clients and holding debt and other fixed income securities is recognised within revenue.
Interest income is recognised as it is earned using the effective interest method, which allocates interest at a constant rate of return over the expected life of the financial instrument based on the estimated future cash flows.
Cost of sales Commissions, external fund manager fees and distribution fees payable to financial institutions, investment platform providers and financial advisers that distribute our products are recorded as fee expense within cost of sales.
Fee expense varies primarily in proportion to AUM and is generally based on an agreed percentage of the value of the investments placed with the Group and is recognised in the income statement as the service is received.
Wealth Management pays interest to clients on deposits taken.
For Wealth Management, earning a net interest margin is a core activity: interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from interest payable elsewhere in the business and is reported as part of cost of sales.
Interest payable is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.
Cost of sales comprises: 2014 2013 m m Fee expense 418.1 416.4 Interest expense incurred by Wealth Management 11.0 14.7 429.1 431.1 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 95 Notes to the accounts 4.
Net gains on financial instruments and other income The Group holds financial instruments as part of its operating and investment capital.
Financial instruments within operating capital include low risk investments held for regulatory capital purposes in certain operating entities and an intra-day stock of units held by the UK unit trust manager to facilitate purchases and sales.
The Groups investment capital is invested in a variety of financial instruments to generate a target risk-adjusted return.
Net gains and losses, principally representing market movements on financial instruments such as fixed income debt instruments, equities and certain loans and deposits in Wealth Management that are held at fair value to match the revaluation of interest rate swaps, are recognised in this line of the income statement as are any gains and losses on derivatives which mainly arise from hedging activities.
Of the Groups investments held at fair value, just over half are carried at fair value through profit or loss FVP and gains and losses arising are recognised in the income statement.
FVP investments are those that are initially designated as such, and those that are held for regular trading.
The remainder are classified as available-for-sale.
This classification is selected typically when the investment is expected to be held for the long term but not necessarily to maturity and where short-term volatility does not reflect long-term expected returns.
Generally, unrealised gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are recorded in other comprehensive income, but the cumulative gains and losses are transferred to the income statement if the investment is impaired, sold or otherwise realised.
The fair value reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the difference between the cost or, if the asset has been reclassified or impaired, the fair value at date of reclassification or impairment and the fair value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale.
Any impairments on loans and receivables are also included in the income statement.
The Group reviews its available-for-sale investments and loans and receivables for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
Other income includes gains and losses on foreign exchange and rent receivable from subletting properties.
The total return on investments also includes interest, which is included in note 6 Net finance income.

Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the Groups administrative expenses and are recognised as the services are provided.
Certain costs, including leases and capitalised costs, are charged evenly over the life of the relevant contract or useful life of the asset.
The biggest part is employee benefits, as shown below.
Other costs include accommodation, information technology and marketing, along with movements in provisions which are recorded based on an estimate of unavoidable costs relating to past transactions.
The control of compensation and total cost are both key performance objectives of the Group.
Compensation is managed within a target compensation to net revenue range of 45 to 49 per cent.
Total costs are managed to a target long-term ratio of 65 per cent.
Targeting a compensation to net revenue range provides some flexibility to manage the overall cost base in response to market conditions.
Employee benefits expense includes salaries and wages, together with the cost of other benefits provided to employees such as pension and bonuses.
The Group makes some performance awards to employees which are deferred over a specified vesting period.
Such awards are charged to the income statement over the performance period and the vesting period.
Further detail on other types of employee benefit can be found elsewhere within these financial statements: see note 26 for pension costs, and note 27 for more detail on compensation that is awarded in Schroders plc shares.

Net finance income The Group earns interest on non-banking activities, principally on cash and deposits with banks, but also as a result of holding investments in debt and fixed income securities.
Fixed income investments and cash held outside of Wealth Management entities are managed mainly by Group Treasury to earn competitive rates of return and ensure liquidity throughout the Group.
Significant amounts of the Groups cash and interest-earning securities are held within Wealth Management and managed by the Wealth Management treasury team.
Interest earned on the assets held within Wealth Management is included in revenue: interest incurred on the liabilities assumed is included in cost of sales.
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method see note 2.
Tax expense The Group is headquartered in the UK and pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries and states in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement see part a and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax.
The charge also includes benefits and charges relating to when income or expenses are recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes or specific treatment relating to acquisitions deferred tax see note 15.
Some current and deferred taxes are recorded through other comprehensive income, mainly relating to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes see part b, or directly to equity where the tax arises from changes in the value of remuneration settled as shares see part c. a Analysis of tax charge reported in the income statement 2014 2013 m m UK Corporation Tax on profits for the year 51.1 47.5 Adjustments in respect of prior year estimates 0.5 0.1 Foreign tax current 63.4 58.1 Foreign tax adjustments in respect of prior year estimates 2.9 1.3 Current tax 116.9 104.2 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 11.2 8.1 Adjustments in respect of prior year estimates 1.9 0.5 Effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 0.1 1.8 Deferred tax 13.0 9.4 Tax charge reported in the income statement 103.9 94.8 b Analysis of tax charge reported in other comprehensive income 2014 2013 m m Current income tax on movements in available-for-sale financial assets 0.6 Deferred tax on actuarial gains losses on defined benefit pension schemes 7.4 2.3 Deferred tax effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 2.5 Tax charge reported in other comprehensive income 6.8 0.2 c Analysis of tax credit reported in equity 2014 2013 m m Current income tax on Equity Compensation Plan and other share-based remuneration 9.9 8.3 Deferred tax on Equity Compensation Plan and other share-based remuneration 5.7 11.2 Deferred tax effect of changes in Corporation Tax rates 1.9 Tax credit reported in equity 4.2 17.6 98 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 7.

Earnings per share This key performance indicator shows the portion of the Groups profit after tax that is attributable to each share excluding own shares held by the Group.
The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all share options that would be expected to be exercised, as they have value to the option holder, had been exercised in the period.
Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce earnings per share.

Dividends Dividends are distributions of profit to holders of the Groups share capital, usually announced with the Groups half-yearly and annual results.
Dividends are recognised only when they are paid or approved by shareholders.

Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables includes prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business.
Amounts due from third parties include fees yet to be received as well as settlement accounts for transactions undertaken on behalf of funds and investors.
Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of bullion which are recorded at fair value, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost see note 11, after the deduction of provisions for impairment.
Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash in advance for services.
As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense recognised in the income statement.

As a result of their short-term nature, the fair value of trade and other receivables held at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value.
Deposits with banks in the form of bullion are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 11.
Financial assets The Group holds financial assets including equities, debt securities and derivatives to support its Group capital strategies and its Wealth Management book and client loans.
The Group enters into derivatives on behalf of Wealth Management clients to enable them to participate in the derivatives market, referred to as client facilitation see note 21.
The Group initially records all financial assets at fair value, which is the cost of acquiring the asset or, in the case of loans, the amount loaned to clients.
The Group holds each financial asset either at fair value fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale or at amortised cost held to maturity and loans and receivables.
Fair value is explained on page 102.
Amortised cost is the basis of moving the initial amount recognised for the financial instrument to the maturity value on a systematic basis using a fixed interest rate effective interest rate, taking account of repayment dates and initial premiums or discounts.
The carrying value of amortised cost financial instruments is adjusted for impairments.
Impairment is normally determined based on a realistic assessment of future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate compared with contractual amounts.
Hedge accounting Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions.
It also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement whereas, for an available-for-sale asset, it would otherwise have been recorded in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the instrument is derecognised.
In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.

Financial assets continued Estimates and judgements fair value measurements The Group holds financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The fair value of financial instruments may require some judgement or may be derived from readily available sources.
The degree of judgement involved is reflected below, although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to be realised.
For investments that are actively traded in financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to official quoted market bid prices.
For investments that are not actively traded, fair value is determined by using quoted prices from third parties such as brokers, market makers and pricing agencies.
Financial assets that have no quoted price principally consist of investments in private equity, derivatives and certain loans in Wealth Management.
The determination of fair value requires significant judgement, particularly in determining whether changes in fair value have occurred since the last formal valuation.
In making this judgement the Group evaluates amongst other factors the effect of cash distributions and changes in the business outlook.
Each instrument has been categorised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the extent of judgements used in the valuation.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and principally comprise investments in quoted equities, daily-priced funds, gilts and exchange-traded derivatives: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from prices that are not traded in an active market but are determined using valuation techniques, which make maximum use of observable market data.
The Groups level 2 financial instruments principally comprise loans held at fair value, foreign exchange contracts and investments in real estate funds.
Valuation techniques may include using a broker quote in an inactive market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of primarily observable market information utilising information readily available via external sources.
For funds not priced on a daily basis for example, real estate funds, the net asset value which is issued monthly or quarterly is used: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data and principally comprise investments in private equity funds.
These funds are managed by third parties and are measured at the values provided by the relevant fund managers.
The most recent available valuation data is used and adjusted for known events such as calls or distributions.
The valuation review is a continual process throughout the year.
The fair value of financial assets held at amortised cost approximates to their carrying value 2013: same.
The Groups financial assets held at fair value excluding those held in the Life Company see note 16 at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Non-current financial assets: Equities 8.2 1.0 39.0 48.2 Debt securities 2.8 2.8 Derivative contracts 3.1 3.1 Other instruments 11.2 11.2 8.2 18.1 39.0 65.3 Current financial assets: Equities 426.1 11.6 1.0 438.7 Debt securities 450.7 4.8 455.5 Derivative contracts 0.6 22.7 23.3 Other instruments 20.0 20.0 877.4 59.1 1.0 937.5 885.6 77.2 40.0 1,002.8 102 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information Financial assets with a fair value of 36.1 million were transferred from level 2 to level 1 during the period, and none from level 1 to level 2.

Transfers are assumed to have occurred at the beginning of the period.
Estimates and judgements impairment of financial assets Financial assets categorised as available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity are reviewed for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
If the year-end fair value of an asset is less than the cost, or deemed cost, of that asset, the Group will assess whether there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In respect of equity products, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value of an instrument is below cost and to the length of time that the fair value of an instrument has been below cost.

Associates and joint ventures Associates are companies the Group partly owns and over which it has significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
Joint ventures are companies in which the Group has an investment where it, along with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require the unanimous consent of the joint partners.
In both cases, the Groups income statement reflects its share of the entitys profit or loss after tax and amortisation of intangible assets, the statement of other comprehensive income records the Groups share of gains and losses arising from the entitys available-for-sale financial assets, the statement of financial position records the Groups share of the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill and intangible assets that arose on purchase less subsequent amortisation and the statement of changes in equity records the Groups share of other equity movements of the entity.
Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed regularly for impairment.
The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the Groups share of profits in its investments yet to be received for example, in the form of dividends or distributions, less any amortisation of intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment provide the infrastructure to enable the Group to operate and principally comprise computer equipment and leasehold improvements.
The cost of these assets is recognised in the income statement over time as a depreciation charge.
The assets are currently depreciated over three to five years.

Goodwill and intangible assets Intangible assets other than software arise when the Group acquires a business and the fair value paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired.
This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business.
Intangible assets include contractual agreements to manage client funds and gain additional access to new or existing clients, geographies and brand names.
Where such assets can be identified, they are recorded as intangible assets arising from business combinations and charged to the income statement over time.
Consideration paid to acquire the business in excess of the acquisition date fair value of net tangible and intangible assets is known as goodwill.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished.
After acquisition, the business is normally integrated fully into the existing Group.
Assessment of whether goodwill has become impaired is based on the expected future returns of the relevant business segment as a whole.
Software purchased for use in the business is also referred to as an intangible asset.
The cost of purchasing software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge.
The treatment is similar to property, plant and equipment and the asset is normally amortised evenly over three to five years, but can have estimated useful lives of up to ten years.
Of the total goodwill of 357.3 million 2013: 357.0 million, 288.4 million 2013: 288.1 million is allocated to Asset Management and 68.9 million 2013: 68.9 million to Wealth Management.
The majority of the Groups intangible assets from business combinations relate to the Cazenove Capital acquisition: the proportion of assets allocated to Asset Management 34.1 million at 2 July 2013 will be charged to the income statement over four years, and the proportion allocated to Wealth Management 66.7 million at 2 July 2013 over eight years.
Estimates and judgements The Group determined the fair value of acquired intangible assets based on estimated profits, taking account of synergies, derived from contractual relationships that existed at the acquisition date.
This assessment involved judgements and assumptions relating to potential future revenues, appropriate discount rates and the expected duration of client relationships.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, was accounted for as goodwill.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that goodwill or an acquired intangible asset may be impaired.
If any indication exists and the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model, details of which are provided below.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be reversed.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, the lowest level of CGU the Group uses to determine impairment is segment level.
The recoverable amount of acquired intangible assets is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the updated discounted valuation of the remaining net residual income stream.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement but may be reversed if relevant conditions improve.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 107 Notes to the accounts 14.
Goodwill and intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which management have based their cash flow projections are market growth rates of 2 per cent.
a pre-tax discount rate of 14 per cent.
expected fund flows and expected changes to margins.
The results of the calculation indicate that goodwill for both CGUs is not impaired.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts of the CGUs is small.
This is due to the amount of goodwill allocated to a business segment relative to the size of the segments future profitability estimate.
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of 1 per cent.
would not lead to any impairment.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2013: nil to its goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccurate projections.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable in future accounting periods.
They generally arise as a result of temporary differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the time at which the relevant transaction is recorded in the accounts.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction that is expected to arise in a future period.
A deferred tax liability represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result of a current or prior year transaction.
Deferred tax liabilities also arise on acquisitions where the amortisation of the acquired intangible asset does not result in a tax deduction.
The deferred tax liability is established on acquisition and is released to the income statement to match the intangible asset amortisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end date.
a Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 48.5 47.8 Acquired in business combinations 16.2 Income statement credit due to changes in timing differences 12.2 9.3 Other comprehensive gains due to changes in timing differences 7.4 0.2 Charge credit taken to equity 5.7 9.3 Other movements in timing differences 0.2 1.5 At 31 December 47.8 48.5 Included in deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences is an asset relating to UK tax deductions for share-based remuneration which is dependent on the prices of the Companys ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares at the time the awards are exercised.
These have been recognised based on the share prices as at 31 December 2014.
A deferred tax asset of 27.3 million 2013: 19.5 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of 9.2 million 2013: 15.6 million relating to losses and other temporary differences has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profit against which these losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
b Deferred tax liabilities in respect of temporary differences 2014 2013 m m At 1 January 1.7 1.9 Income statement credit 0.8 0.1 Other movements in timing differences 0.5 0.1 At 31 December 0.4 1.7 The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences regarding investments in subsidiaries is 7.6 million 2013: 7.0 million.
Deferred tax has not been provided as the relevant parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Unit-linked liabilities and assets backing unit-linked liabilities The Group operates a unit-linked life assurance business through the wholly-owned subsidiary, Schroder Pension Management Limited referred to as the Life Company.
The Life Company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
The investment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial liabilities due to Life Company investors policyholders within unit-linked liabilities.
The investment product is almost identical to a unit trust.
The Group earns fee income from managing the investment which is included in net revenue.
As it is a life assurance product, the contractual rights and obligations of the investments remain with the Group and the AUM is therefore included on the Groups statement of financial position, together with the liability to investors.
Financial assets and liabilities held by the Life Company are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Other balances include cash and receivables, which are measured at amortised cost see note 11.
The Life Companys assets are regarded as current assets as they represent the amount available to Life Company investors or third-party investors in other funds who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Gains and losses from assets and liabilities held to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the Life Company or third-party investors in the funds.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.
Unit-linked liabilities comprise: Restated 2014 2013 m m Financial liabilities due to Life Company investors 11,080.3 9,912.0 1 Financial liabilities due to third-party investors 2,578.1 1,774.4 13,658.4 11,686.4 1 In accordance with accounting standards, the Group is deemed to hold a controlling interest in certain funds as a result of the investments held by the Life Company.
This results in all of the assets and liabilities of those funds being presented within the Groups statement of financial position and the third-party interest in the fund being recorded as a financial liability due to third-party investors.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements see note 28 and Presentation of the financial statements.
The Group has no primary exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments of the Life Company.
The risks and rewards associated with its investments are normally borne by the investors in the Life Companys investment products or third-party investors in the funds and not by the Life Company itself.
Fair value measurements of Life Company financial assets and liabilities Each of the Life Companys financial assets and liabilities has been categorised using a fair value hierarchy.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined in note 11.
The Life Companys financial instruments at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2014 Financial instruments not Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 at fair value Total m m m m m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 10,830.7 1,950.4 49.6 827.7 13,658.4 Unit-linked liabilities 13,488.2 5.5 164.7 13,658.4 Restated 2013 Financial instruments not Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 at fair value Total m m m m m Assets backing unit-linked liabilities 9,971.2 718.3 158.2 838.7 11,686.4 Unit-linked liabilities 11,644.6 8.6 33.2 11,686.4 Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements see note 28 and Presentation of the financial statements.
The types of instruments found in each of the above levels 1 and 3 for the Life Company are the same as those listed for the non-Life Company instruments in note 11.
Level 2 investments principally comprise corporate bonds.

Trade and other payables Trade and other payables excluding deferred income represent amounts the Group is due to pay to third parties in the normal course of business.
These include expense accruals as well as settlement accounts amounts due to be paid for transactions undertaken.
Trade creditors are costs that have been billed: accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment, but for which the goods or services have been received.
Trade and other payables held at fair value comprise deferred cash awards deferred employee remuneration payable in cash and bullion deposits by customers.
Deferred income represents fees received in advance of services being performed.
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value see note 11, as shown below.
The fair value of bullion deposits by customers is derived from level 1 inputs see note 11.
Deferred cash awards derive their value from the fair value of units in funds to which the employee award is linked fund awards.
The Groups trade and other payables contractually mature in the following time periods: 2014 2013 m m 1 Less than 1 year 682.2 700.4 1 2 years 37.0 35.6 2 5 years 30.6 26.4 More than 5 years 2.3 1.7 69.9 63.7 752.1 764.1 1 Settlement accounts are generally settled within four working days and trade creditors have an average settlement period of 20 working days 2013: 21 working days.

Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Wealth Management clients and banking counterparties.
They also include derivatives held for client facilitation or interest rate matching in Wealth Management see note 21, and the hedging of risk exposures within investment capital.
The fair value measurements section below reflects the level of judgement involved in determining fair value although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to equal the actual settlement cost.
Liabilities arise in respect of consolidated funds consolidation occurs when the Group is deemed to control a fund, usually in respect of Life Company or seed capital investments.
When this happens, the Group accounts for the fund in its statement of financial position as if it were wholly-owned by the Group, but records an additional liability representing the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third-party investors.
Where the investment is held by the Life Company, the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors is shown as part of unit-linked liabilities see note 16.
Financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost or fair value see note 11, as shown below.

Maturity profiles of client accounts, deposits by banks and derivative contracts can be found in notes 20 and 21.
Fair value measurements The Group holds financial liabilities that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The Groups financial liabilities held at fair value excluding those held in the Life Company see note 16 at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Non-current financial liabilities: Derivative contracts 3.0 3.0 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 7.6 0.8 8.4 10.6 0.8 11.4 Current financial liabilities: Derivative contracts 1.8 10.6 12.4 Other financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss 43.2 43.2 45.0 10.6 55.6 45.0 21.2 0.8 67.0 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 111 Notes to the accounts 18.

Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement and therefore usually require the use of estimates.
They are recognised when three conditions are fulfilled: when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Group will incur a loss in order to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
They are recorded at the Groups best estimate of the cost of settling the obligation.
Any differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated.
Where the estimated timing and settlement is longer-term, the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events not within the Groups control, but where there is a possible obligation.
Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included within the statement of financial position.

Provisions and contingent liabilities continued The Groups provisions are expected to mature in the following time periods: 2014 2013 m m Less than 1 year 22.7 17.8 1 2 years 23.9 26.7 2 3 years 0.8 0.7 3 4 years 5.6 0.8 4 5 years 0.7 0.8 More than 5 years 0.3 4.4 31.3 33.4 54.0 51.2 The provision for dilapidations and onerous leases covers lease commitments with a weighted average maturity of two years 2013: three years.
Legal and regulatory obligations associated with the Groups business arise from past events that are estimated to crystallise mainly within two years 2013: two years.
As at 31 December 2013 and 2014, the Group has recorded a 15.0 million provision for a possible penalty payable in connection with the US Department of Justice DOJ programme announced on 29 August 2013 that applies industry wide to Swiss banks in order to identify accounts related to persons who may not have been US-tax compliant.
The Groups Swiss bank is participating voluntarily in the programme.
Where a Swiss bank is unable to provide fully sufficient evidence of compliance, a penalty may be payable.
This programme may complete in 2015 and there is uncertainty as to the extent of any payment required by Schroders.
Details of the programme can be found at the DOJ website.
The Group established a provision in 2013 based on a review of relevant accounts that existed on or after 1 August 2008.
The provision relates principally to closed accounts.
There is uncertainty mainly in respect of the range of probabilities applied to relevant accounts which will only become certain following the conclusion of the DOJs analysis of the Swiss banks submission of its evidence.
As a result, the actual payment is expected to vary from the amount provided.
Estimates and judgements The timing and amount of settlement of each legal claim or potential claim and constructive obligation is uncertain.
The Group has performed an assessment of the timing and amount, and reviews this assessment periodically.
For some provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
However, the onerous lease provision also includes an assessment of potential cash inflows where these are not contractually binding from subletting arrangements.
Potential legal claims, regulatory related costs and other obligations to third parties arise as a consequence of normal business activity.
They can arise from actual or alleged breaches of obligations and may be covered by the Groups insurance arrangements, but subject to insurance excess.
In certain circumstances, legal and regulatory claims can arise despite there being no error or breach.
Our risk management and compliance procedures are designed to mitigate, but are not able to eliminate, the risk of losses occurring.
Where such claims and costs arise there is often uncertainty over whether a payment will be required and the quantum and timing of that payment.
As a result there is also uncertainty over the timing and amount of any insurance recovery, although this does not change the likelihood of insurance cover being available, where applicable.
The Group makes periodic assessments of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine an appropriate provision.
Some matters may be settled through commercial negotiation as well as being covered in whole or in part by the Groups insurance arrangements.
The Group has made provisions based on reasonable expectation of likely outflows.
However the results of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different outcomes.
b Contingent liabilities 2014 2013 m m Assets pledged as collateral security 54.9 57.4 Guarantees and irrevocable letters of credit 34.7 34.5 89.6 91.9 Transactions giving rise to contingent liabilities are principally in Wealth Management and are only entered into by the Group once it has received sufficient high quality collateral from the client.
Assets pledged as collateral security reflect the value of instruments that the Group is required to hold with clearing agents in order to support the execution of the Groups security transactions.
The pledged assets provide collateral in the event of the Group not settling trades within agreed time frames.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 113 Notes to the accounts 20.
Financial instrument risk management As a result of its operations, the Group is exposed to multiple forms of risk including: i the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received credit risk : ii the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they fall due liquidity risk : and iii the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in factors such as market prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates market risk.
The management of such risks is embedded in managerial responsibilities fundamental to the wellbeing of the Group.
This note sets out the nature of the risks and their quantification and management.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments that it holds as principal.
In addition, due to the nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of a percentage of AUM and are therefore impacted by financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This note deals with the primary exposure only.
Financial instruments give rise to market, liquidity and credit risk exposures.
Settlement of financial instruments on both a principal and agency basis gives rise to operational risk.
The execution and effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Board and is then delegated to senior management.
The Audit and Risk Committee provide oversight and the Risk and Compliance functions are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, an independent assessment of the control environment is provided by Internal Audit.
The financial risks of these products are largely borne by the third-party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the Life Company provides the investment products, both the investments and the third-party obligations are recorded in the statement of financial position.
Financial instrument risk management in respect of the Life Company is set out in note 16. a Capital Total capital comprises: 2014 Restated 2013 m m Regulatory capital 673 603 Other operating capital 284 311 Operating capital 957 914 Investment capital 725 515 Seed capital 163 182 Other items 693 658 Total capital 2,538 2,269 Includes RWC Partners Limited and Schroder Ventures Investments Limited associates.
Comprises goodwill, intangible assets, pension scheme surpluses, other associates and joint ventures, and deferred tax.
i Operating capital Operating capital is the capital required to meet regulatory and working capital requirements.
The Group holds surplus capital over the regulatory requirements which is managed by Group Treasury and in-house fund managers.
Regulators oversee the activities and impose minimum capital requirements on the Groups operating subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate standing with counterparties and meet working capital requirements.
The Group Capital Committee reviews compliance with this policy.
Schroders plc is regulated by the PRA as a UK consolidated group.
Its capital resources calculated for a Group holding a banking licence amounted to 1,974 million 2013: 1,673 million and its Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement was 387 million 2013: 342 million.
Other regulatory minimum capital requirements apply to the Group which set the minimum requirement at 673 million 2013: 603 million.
The Group holds sufficient capital to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
All regulated entities within the Group complied with regulatory minimum capital requirements during the year.
ii Investment capital Investment capital is shareholders investible equity held in excess of operating requirements.
It is managed with the aim of achieving a low-volatility cash plus 2 per cent.
It is mainly held in cash, government and  bonds, investment grade corporate bonds, and Schroders funds.
Investment capital is also used to help support the organic development of existing and new business strategies and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities as they arise, such as acquisitions that will accelerate the development of the business.
iii Seed capital Seed capital may be used to develop new investment strategies, co-invest selectively alongside our clients and finance growth opportunities.
Seed capital is deployed principally to support the growth of Asset Management and, where practical, the market risk on its seed capital investments is hedged.
Surplus capital is deployed in accordance with limits approved by the Board.

Financial instrument risk management continued b C redit risk, liquidity risk and market risk i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument, loan or commitment will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge an obligation.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss arising from credit spread price changes in a portfolio of investments is excluded.
This risk is addressed within Pricing risk.
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay, in full, amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by: approving lending policies that specify the type of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins: setting limits for individuals exposures and sectors: and by taking security.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
In addition the Group holds collateral on its loans and advances to clients and certain derivative positions.
Wealth Management activities All facility requests are presented to the relevant Wealth Management credit committees and counterparty exposures are monitored daily.
Loans and advances to clients are secured on a range of assets including real estate both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and insurance policies.
The Group does not usually provide loans and advances to clients on an unsecured basis.
Where disposal of non-cash collateral is required, in the event of default, the terms and conditions relevant to the specific contract and country will apply.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to clients loans.
Credit limits are set following an assessment of the market value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted if these limits are breached, or if collateral is not sufficient to cover the outstanding exposure.
No provisions 2013: 13.0 million are held against gross loans and receivables that are recorded at amortised cost.
The amount of change in the year in the fair value of loans and receivables held at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in credit risk is a loss of 1.4 million 2013: 0.1 million and 7.1 million 2013: 5.7 million cumulatively.
This is due to a shortfall in the value of the collateral held against the loans and receivables.
Wealth Management takes a conservative approach to its treasury investments placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, UK and overseas banks, central banks, supranational banks and sovereigns.
Debt securities held within the Wealth Management treasury book are classified as loans and receivables or as held to maturity financial assets and are unsecured.
Policies covering various counterparty and market risk limits are set and monitored by the relevant Wealth Management asset and liability management committees.
All instruments held within Wealth Management are rated investment grade.
Other activities Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Groups Asset Management activities and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and unless a client has withdrawn its funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
Fee debtors past due but not yet impaired as at 31 December 2014 were 13.4 million 2013: 10.0 million, the majority of which is less than 60 days past due.
Factors considered in determining whether impairment has taken place include how many days past the due date a receivable is, deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, and knowledge of specific events that could influence a debtors ability to pay.
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting a conservative approach and through ongoing credit analysis.
Cash is held with well-rated banks, government and  bonds are rated AA or better, corporate bond portfolios have an investment grade mandate, and exposure to sub-investment grade debt is low.
Derivative positions are taken in exchange-traded securities where there is minimal credit risk.
Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity of one month.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents in the non-Wealth Management entities are invested primarily in current accounts, on deposit with well-rated banks, and invested in money market funds.

Financial instrument risk management continued ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Group has a clearly defined liquidity risk management framework in place.
Group policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently, comply with regulatory liquidity requirements, and have adequate liquidity for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, all companies should maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are 53.4 million 2013: 49.7 million, the majority of which are current.
Wealth Management activities The principal liquidity risk the Group faces concerns its Wealth Management liabilities.
The liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet regulatory and prudential requirements, to cover cash flow imbalances and fluctuations in funding, and to ensure the timely repayment of funds to depositors.
2 Includes client accounts held at fair value through profit or loss of 7.6 million 2013: 14.9 million.
Other activities Liquidity risk in the rest of the Group is low.
Excluding the Life Company and consolidated funds, the Asset Management and Group segment together hold cash and cash equivalents of 860.8 million 2013: 697.6 million.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 50.0 million 2013: 50.0 million that expires on 30 September 2018 and 5.4 million 2013: 8.4 million of loan notes as part of the acquisition of Cazenove Capital that are repayable on 12 July 2018 and subject to early redemption rights in certain circumstances.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 117 Notes to the accounts 20.
Financial instrument risk management continued iii Market risk The sensitivities to market risk are estimated as follows: 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 A reasonable Increase A reasonable Increase change in the decrease change in the decrease variable within Increase in other variable within Increase in other the next decrease in components the next decrease in components calendar year post-tax profit of equity calendar year post-tax profit of equity 1 Variable % m m % m m 2 Interest ratesincrease 0.5 2 0.5 4 -decrease US dollar against Sterlingstrengthen 8 1 14 8 2 17 -weaken 6 1 9 6 1 11 Euro against Sterlingstrengthen 5 6 7 5 5 7 -weaken 8 9 10 6 5 7 3 FTSE-All Share Indexincrease 20 3 19 20 5 -decrease 20 18 4 20 1 5 1 The underlying assumption is that there is one variable increase decrease with all other variables held constant.
2 Assumes that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
3 Assumes that changes in the FTSE-All Share Index correlate to changes in the fair value of the Groups equity investments.
Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital, seed capital, deferred employee compensation fund awards and some investments held for regulatory capital.
However, the more significant risk is the impact on the Groups fee income as this is principally determined on percentages of the fair value of AUM.
This risk cannot be easily mitigated but is addressed to some extent by ongoing net new business.
The Group does not hedge exposure to price risk except in respect of seed capital and employee compensation awards in the form of fund awards when it is considered that the amount of risk is material and an effective hedge is available.
The changes used in the sensitivity analysis were provided by the Groups Global Economics team who determine reasonable assumptions.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, interest rate risk is monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee on a daily basis.
Wealth Management manages its interest rate risk by matching asset and liability positions and through the use of interest rate swaps.
Within Wealth Management, there are sensitivity-based and stress-based models used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These involve assessing the impact of a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates, together with extreme scenarios for the stress tests.
The impact is calculated regularly for each currency and in aggregate.
Other activities Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally expected to be placed on deposit for longer than three months.
The Groups capital includes investments in government bonds and corporate investment-grade bonds managed by the Groups fixed income fund managers.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Wealth Management activities In Wealth Management, some loans and advances to clients, as well as a proportion of the treasury activities, are undertaken in foreign currencies.
This is managed by the treasury departments within agreed limits that are set and monitored by the relevant risk committees.

Financial instrument risk management continued Other activities The Groups policy in relation to revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure in Asset Management activities is generally not to hedge.
The Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered part of the business.
The Group also has exposure to foreign currency through investments in currencies other than sterling.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate this exposure.
The gain or loss on the hedging instruments is included in the statement of other comprehensive income or the income statement, as appropriate.
The use of such instruments is subject to the approval of the Group Capital Committee.
Derivative contracts a The Groups use of derivatives The Group holds derivatives for risk management, client facilitation, and within its investment portfolios to provide exposure to market returns.
The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group effectively to fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses on receivables and payables in foreign currencies.
The Group uses equity contracts to hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to help establish a new product rather than gain additional market exposure.
Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to fixed or floating rates of interest.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
This may take the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal risk that the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
Client facilitation: the Groups Wealth Management entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business, they transact as agent or as principal in financial assets and liabilities including derivatives in order to facilitate client portfolio requirements.
Wealth Managements policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its client facilitation positions.
The hedging of equal and opposite risks seeks to mitigate market risk, but does not eliminate the possibility of credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposure to credit risk, see b below and note 20. b Derivatives used by the Group Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date at a specified price.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
No exchange of principal takes place, except in the case of certain currency swaps.
The Groups credit risk represents the potential cost of replacing the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts, and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties in accordance with its internal policies and procedures.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 119 Notes to the accounts 21.
Derivative contracts continued Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser and assumes foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may be either exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
Futures contracts are standardised contracts to buy or sell specified assets for an agreed price at a specified future date.
Contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange which acts as an intermediary between the two parties.
For futures contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
The fair value of derivative instruments becomes favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The fair values are set out below: 2014 2013 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate contracts 0.8 2.0 1.5 3.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 22.6 9.3 9.0 6.0 Equity contracts 3.0 4.1 10.3 6.2 26.4 15.4 20.8 15.8 2014 2013 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m 1 2 Net-settled derivative contracts maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year 0.8 3.1 8.6 4.6 1 3 years 2.5 3.0 2.1 4.8 3 5 years 0.5 0.7 More than 5 years 0.4 0.4 3.8 6.1 11.8 9.8 3 2 Gross-settled derivatives maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year: Gross inflows 953.0 575.4 545.9 434.6 Gross outflows 948.0 577.5 541.1 435.3 Difference between future contractual cash flows and fair value 17.6 7.2 4.2 5.3 22.6 9.3 9.0 6.0 26.4 15.4 20.8 15.8 1 Comprise interest rate and equity contracts.

Share capital and share premium Share capital represents the number of issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in Schroders plc multiplied by their nominal value of 1 each.
Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above nominal value to Schroders plc when it has issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares.
There are certain circumstances in which the share premium can be reduced but these have not arisen in 2014 or 2013.
The Company has no authority to issue, buy back, or cancel ordinary shares in issue including those held in trust and has authority limited by shareholder resolution to issue or purchase non-voting ordinary shares, which may either be cancelled or held in treasury.

The difference between the share classes The non-voting ordinary shares carry the same rights as ordinary shares except they do not confer the right to attend and vote at any general meeting of the Company, and that on a capitalisation issue they carry the right to receive non-voting ordinary shares rather than ordinary shares.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 121 Notes to the accounts 23.
Own shares Own shares are recorded by the Group when non-voting ordinary shares are acquired by the Company, or ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares are acquired through employee benefit trusts.
There are two main reasons why this may happen: first, it enables the Group to meet share-based remuneration awards to employees in the form of shares see note 27 in a way that does not dilute the percentage holdings of existing shareholders.
Second, the Group may wish to hold some of its shares in treasury to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes.
Own shares are held at cost and their purchase reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.

Commitments Commitments represent amounts the Group has contractually committed to pay to third parties but which do not yet represent a charge or asset.
This gives an indication of committed future cash flows.
Commitments at the year end do not impact on the Groups financial results for the year.
The Group leases office space and equipment.
Lease agreements can commit the Group to significant future expenditure and the table below discloses the Groups commitments to make such payments.
Such commitments are not recorded on the Groups statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
The Group sublets a small number of its leased properties where such properties, or parts of such properties, are no longer required for use by the Group.
The table below discloses the commitments sublessees have made in respect of such arrangements.
These commitments are not recorded on the statement of financial position in advance of the period to which they relate.
However, they may be used to determine the onerous lease provision if the rental income does not equal or exceed the Groups own rental obligation see note 19.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit DB where the Group has an obligation to provide participating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary for each year of service, and defined contribution DC, where the Groups contribution to an employees pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage of salary.
Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made.
If ring-fenced assets are held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, and if not, it is unfunded.
The Group periodically reviews its funded DB schemes using actuarial specialists to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are or will be entitled to.
In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to reverse the deficit.
The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus a notional net interest charge if the scheme is in deficit or income if it is in surplus based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual investment returns and the notional interest amount, as well as actuarial changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets if any and the  estimates of the present value of future liabilities.
The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes overseas.
This means that no future service will contribute to the closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme rules as at 30 April 2011.
The Groups exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make.
These contributions generally stop when employment ceases.
The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees pension schemes in that period.
The disclosures within this note are provided mainly in respect of the principal DB scheme which is the DB section of the funded Schroders Retirement Benefits Scheme the Scheme.
Certain comparative disclosures are also provided in respect of the Cazenove Capital Management Limited Pension Scheme the Cazenove Capital Scheme, a funded DB scheme that was transferred into the Scheme on 31 December 2014.

Retirement benefit obligations continued i Profile of the Scheme The Scheme is administered by a Trustee company, Schroder Pension Trustee Limited.
The board of the Trustee company comprises an independent chairman, three directors appointed by the employer and two directors elected by the Scheme members.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The Trustees investment committee comprises four of the Trustee directors and two representatives of the Group.
This committee, which reports to the Trustee board, is responsible for setting the investment strategy and monitoring the performance of the investment manager.
Under the Scheme, employees are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on a specified percentage of their final pensionable salary or, in the case of active members at 30 April 2011, actual pensionable salaries at that date, for each year of service.
These benefits are adjusted for the effects of inflation, subject to a cap of 2.5 per cent.
for pensions accrued after 12 August 2007 and 5.0 per cent.
for pensions accrued before that date.
As at 31 December 2014, there were no active members in the DB section 2013: nil and 1,553 active members in the DC section 2013: 1,598.
The weighted average duration of the Schemes DB obligation is 21 years 2013: 21 years.
Membership details of the DB section of the Scheme as at 31 December are as follows: 2014 2013 Number of deferred members 1,605 1,622 Total deferred pensions at date of leaving Scheme 14.6m per annum 14.4m per annum Average age deferred 51 49 Number of pensioners 738 727 Average age pensioners 69 68 Total pensions in payment 16.9m per annum 16.4m per annum ii Funding requirements The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2011.
It disclosed that the market value of the assets of the Scheme represented 101 per cent.
of the liabilities at that date, calculated on the funding basis applicable to the Scheme, for the benefits that had accrued to members at that date.
No additional funding was required.
No contributions were made to the Scheme in the year 2013: nil and the Group does not expect to make any contributions in 2015.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2014 is currently in progress.
iii Risks of the Scheme The Company and the Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes, as detailed below, an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Scheme by investing in assets such as swaps which perform in line with the liabilities of the Scheme so as to protect against inflation and or interest rates being higher than expected.
The most significant risks that the Scheme exposes the Group to are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this may create a deficit.
The Group manages this risk by holding 39.3 per cent.
of Scheme assets in a liability-driven investment LDI portfolio and the remainder in growth assets such as the Schroder Life Diversified Growth Fund and a Strategic Beta portfolio.
This asset mix is designed to provide returns that match or exceed the unwinding of the discount rate in the long term, but which can create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Credit risk The assets of the Scheme include LDI and other fixed income instruments that expose the Group to credit risk.
A significant amount of this exposure is to the UK Government as a result of holding gilts and bonds guaranteed by the UK Government.
Other instruments held include derivatives, which are collaterised daily to cover unrealised gains or losses.
The minimum rating for any derivatives counterparty is A Standard & Poors.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this should be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes LDI portfolio which comprises gilts and other LDI instruments.
The LDI portfolio has been designed to mitigate interest rate exposures measured on a funding rather than an accounting basis.
One of the principal differences between these bases is that the liability under the funding basis is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to gilt yields: the latter uses corporate bond yields.
As a result, the LDI portfolio hedges against interest rate risk by purchasing instruments that seek to replicate movements in gilt yields rather than corporate bond yields.
Movements in the different types of instrument are not exactly correlated, and it is therefore likely that a tracking error can arise when assessing whether the LDI portfolio has provided an effective hedge against interest rate risk on an accounting basis.
At 31 December 2014, the LDI portfolio was designed to mitigate 70 per cent.
of the Schemes exposure to changes in gilt yields.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against inflation.
The majority of the growth assets are either unaffected by or not closely correlated with inflation, which means that an increase in inflation will also decrease any Scheme surplus.
The LDI portfolio includes instruments such as index-linked gilts to provide protection against inflation risk.
of the Schemes exposure to inflation risk.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 125 Notes to the accounts 26.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liability.
iv Reporting at 31 December 2014 The principal financial assumptions used for the Scheme were as listed below: 2014 2013 % % Discount rate 3.6 4.5 RPI inflation rate 3.3 3.7 CPI inflation rate 2.2 2.7 Future pension increases for benefits earned before 13 August 2007 3.2 3.5 Future pension increases for benefits earned after 13 August 2007 2.1 2.3 Average number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 60: Men 29 29 Women 31 31 Average number of years future pensioners currently aged 45 are expected to live beyond age 60: Men 31 31 Women 33 33 The net interest for pension costs is determined by applying the corporate bond rate to the opening net surplus or deficit in the Scheme.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality, long-dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.
Estimates and judgements Assumptions made on expected mortality rates are inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of 1.5 per cent.
Mortality tables for female pensioners are scaled back by 5 per cent.
to reflect the history of longer life expectancy of the Groups employees.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
The financial impact of the Scheme on the Group has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based on an assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2014.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are: 2014 2013 m m Interest income on Scheme assets 36.1 35.2 Interest cost on Scheme liabilities 33.3 32.1 Total interest income recognised in the income statement in respect of the Scheme 2.8 3.1 Income statement charge in respect of other defined benefit schemes 1.0 1.3 Total defined benefit schemes income statement credit 1.8 1.8 The amounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are: 2014 2013 m m Return on Scheme assets in excess of that recognised in interest income 119.3 22.3 Actuarial gains due to change in demographic assumptions 1.9 8.6 Actuarial losses due to change in financial assumptions 89.2 41.1 Actuarial gains due to experience 6.7 1.3 Total other comprehensive income loss in respect of the Scheme 38.7 8.9 Other comprehensive loss in respect of other defined benefit schemes 1.8 0.9 Total other comprehensive income loss in respect of defined benefit schemes 36.9 9.8 126 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 26.

The Group has not materially changed the basis of any of the principal financial assumptions underlying the calculation of the Schemes net financial position during 2014, although such assumptions have been amended where applicable to reflect current market conditions and expectations.
Administration expenses and the levy payable to the Pension Protection Fund are met directly by the Group.

The restructuring was completed in 2014.
It is intended that the restructuring will enable the Scheme to benefit from the economies of scale, broader range of strategies and better liquidity that the unitised vehicle can offer, and the strategy aims at an overall reduction in funding level volatility without a significant decrease in expected returns.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2014 127 Notes to the accounts 27.
Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc.
Employees are generally not able to exercise such awards until three years after the award has been made, although conditions vary between different types of award.
Accounting for share-based awards settled by transferring shares to the awardee equity-settled differs from accounting for similar awards settled in cash cash-settled.
The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date or, in the case of grandfathered awards arising on business combinations, the fair value of the share awards at the acquisition date.
Such awards can include share options or share awards which may or may not have performance criteria.
The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued i. e. estimates of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria, the contribution, if required, by the employee and the time value of money.
This initial fair value is charged to the income statement reflecting benefits received from employment, where relevant, in the performance period and over the vesting period.
The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity, where the award is expected to be settled through the issue of shares.
Such awards constituted 9.9 per cent.
of salaries and other remuneration.
The Group may make share-based payments to employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares.
It is our practice to hedge all awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares between the grant date and the exercise date.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited result in a credit to the income statement reversing the previous charge in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.
The Group recognised total expenses of 61.3 million 2013: 59.8 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year of which 60.6 million 2013: 56.6 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Included within equity-settled share-based payments were exceptional items of 11.2 million 2013: 7.5 million.
The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements further details of the current schemes may be found in the Remuneration report : a 2000 Equity Compensation Plan and 2011 Equity Compensation Plan Awards over ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares made under the Groups Equity Compensation Plans are charged at fair value as Operating expenses in the income statement.
There are no performance conditions attached to the awards.
For the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares at the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
For the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
The fair value charges, adjusted to reflect actual levels of vesting, are spread over the performance period and the vesting period of the awards.
The award is structured as a nil cost option.

The awards do not have performance conditions attached and vest in three equal tranches between three and five years from the date of award.
The Group does not intend to make any further awards under the Plan.
The fair value of awards made under the Plan at the acquisition date is spread over the performance and vesting periods.

Interests in unconsolidated structured entities Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Groups interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities are described below.
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from its principal activity, the management of assets on behalf of its clients.
Assets under management, excluding deposits by Wealth Management clients and some segregated client portfolios held within the Institutional channel of the Groups Asset Management business, are managed within structured entities.
These structured entities typically consist of unitised vehicles such as Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Authorised Unit Trusts AUTs and Socits dInvestissement Capital Variable SICAVs, which entitle investors to a percentage of the vehicles net asset value.
The structured entities are financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors, which may include the Group should it wish to invest.
Such investments typically take place for the purpose of providing seed capital in support of new investment strategies or through the investment of the Groups capital to generate investment return as well as by the Life Company on behalf of policyholders.
As fund manager, the Group does not guarantee returns on its funds or commit to financially support its funds.
A small proportion of the Groups funds, principally real estate funds, are permitted to raise finance through loans from banks and other financial institutions.
Where external finance is raised, the Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings.
The business activity of all structured entities, in which the Group has an interest, is the management of assets in order to maximise investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and or investment income.
The Group earns a management fee from its structured entities, based on a percentage of the entitys net asset value and, where contractually agreed, a performance fee, based on outperformance against predetermined benchmarks.
In addition, where the Group owns a proportion of the structured entity it is entitled to receive investment returns.

Interests in unconsolidated structured entities continued The Groups interest in structured entities is reflected in the Groups assets under management AUM.
Certain AUM is managed in investment vehicles that are not considered to be structured entities, as a result of voting structures that allow the Group to be removed as manager without cause 0.2 billion.
Within Asset Management certain Institutional client portfolios are invested directly 126.2 billion outside of structured entities.
A significant part of Wealth Management AUM 21.6 billion relates to contractual relationships which the Group has directly with its clients rather than through structured entities for example, the provision of discretionary and advisory asset management and banking services.
In addition, Wealth Management AUM in the form of loans and advances to customers and deposits by banks 3.1 billion is also outside of structured entities and 0.8 billion is managed in investment vehicles that are not considered to be structured entities as a result of voting structures.
AUM within consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, comprising net assets for Intermediary clients as well as some assets held for Institutional and Wealth Management clients, is shown below.
The Groups beneficial interest in structured entities has been excluded and is described separately.

AUM within consolidated structured entities represents the net assets of the consolidated structured entity beneficially owned by third parties.
These entities are accounted for as subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10.
The Group has no direct exposure to losses in relation to the AUM reported above, except where it also invests, as the investment risk is borne by external investors.
The main risk the Group faces from its interest in AUM managed on behalf of external investors is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients.
Outflows from funds are dependant on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations.
Further information on these risks can be found in the Business review section.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities, including proprietary investments, recognised in the statement of financial position, which are equal to the Groups maximum exposure to loss from those interests.

The Groups statement of financial position also includes the Life Company assets of 13,658.4 million, which are principally investments in unconsolidated structured entities.
The exposure to the risks and rewards associated with these assets is borne by unit-linked policy holders, or, where Life Company funds are consolidated, third-party investors in those funds.
Financial assets and cash and cash equivalents represent the Groups interest in unconsolidated structured entities through its proprietary investments, including seed capital, of 622.5 million.
These include funds managed by the Group with a carrying value of 430.4 million as well as investments of 192.1 million that are external to the Group and in which the Group has no interest apart from its role as investor.
The main risk the Group faces from its interests in unconsolidated structured entities arising from proprietary investments is that the investments will decrease in value.
Note 20 includes further information on the Groups exposure to market risk arising from investments held in investment capital.
Fee income includes 1,081.6 million 2013: 1,014.8 million of fees from structured entities managed by the Group and net gains on financial instruments and other income includes gains of 12.3 million 2013: 2.4 million.
Financial support for consolidated structured entities where there is no contractual obligation to do so The Group supports some of its funds through the injection of seed capital in order to enable the funds to establish a track record before they are more widely marketed.
During the year, the Group purchased units at a cost of 54.1 million to provide seed capital to investment funds managed by the Group, of which 27.1 million resulted in the consolidation of those funds, and 27.0 million did not.

Financial instrument risk management The Companys policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, it should have adequate capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in the Key risks and mitigations section within the Strategic report and the Risk and internal controls section within the Governance report of this document as well as in note 20.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its normal course of business.
