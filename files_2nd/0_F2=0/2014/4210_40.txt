Financial Statements Notes to the Group Accounts 1.
Segmental analysis With effect from May 2014, in order to catalyse faster sales growth and sharpen innovation further, the Groups business has been reshaped.
From this date four global market sectors, Personal Care, Life Sciences which incorporates our Health Care and Crop Care business areas, Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals have been created.
The new structure combines sales, marketing and research by sector into dedicated global teams.
These are the segments for which summary management information is presented to the Groups Executive Committee, which is deemed to be the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
There is no material trade between segments.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to a specific segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, inventories and trade and other receivables.
