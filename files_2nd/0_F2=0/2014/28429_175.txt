294 Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes on the EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results continued 13 Reconciliation of movement in net worth and value of in-force for long-term business continued Notes i The amounts shown in respect of free surplus and the value of in-force business for UK insurance operations for intra-group dividends including statutory transfers include the repayment of contingent loan funding.
Contingent loan funding represents amounts whose repayment to the lender is contingent upon future surpluses emerging from certain contracts specified under the arrangement.
If insufficient surplus emerges on those contracts, there is no recourse to other assets of the Group and the liability is not payable to the degree of shortfall.

It mainly arises from the decrease in the expected long-term separate account rate of return following the 90 basis points decline in the US 10-year treasury bond rate and the impact from new business written in the year, partly offset by the level of equity performance.
14 Expected transfer of value of in-force business to free surplus The discounted value of in-force business and required capital can be reconciled to the 2014 and 2013 totals in the tables below for the emergence of free surplus as follows: 2014 m 2013 m note 13 Required capital 4,556 3,954 note 13 Value of in-force VIF 20,375 17,439 note 13 Add back: deduction for cost of time value of guarantees 575 196 Expected cash flow from sale of Japan life business 23 25 note Other items 1,382 1,157 Total 24,101 20,407 Note Other items represent amounts incorporated into VIF where there is no definitive timeframe for when the payments will be made or receipts received.
In particular, other items includes the deduction of the value of the shareholders interest in the estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative, this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile opposite.
