ACCouNTINg poLICIES, ESTIMATES AND juDgEMENTS Accounting policies Morgan Advanced Materials plc the Company is a company incorporated in the uK.
The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, and include the Groups interest in associates.
The parent Company Financial Statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 December 2014.
The Group maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 31 December.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial reporting Standards as adopted by the Eu adopted IFrSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with uK Generally Accepted Accounting practice: these are presented on pages 145 to 154. where possible the Group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting policy.
Except for the changes set out in the Adoption of new and revised standards section, the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.
a Measurement convention The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Functional and presentation currency The Group Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii Acquisitions Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFrS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
iii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
iv Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

ACCouNTINg poLICIES, ESTIMATES AND juDgEMENTS continued Accounting policies continued d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFrS are recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income OCI.
e Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
when a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in OCI and there is objective evidence that the asset is permanently impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.
A significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial assets fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
f Revenue revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.

ACCouNTINg poLICIES, ESTIMATES AND juDgEMENTS continued Accounting policies continued g Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved.
Accounting estimates and judgements Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The following accounting estimates are subject to significant uncertainty: Recognition of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill Note 11 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition.
These primarily relate to technology and trademarks and customer relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers.
The Group has estimated that the customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Note 11 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk Note 19 contains information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis.
The Group establishes both specific and general allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
The general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Pension assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 20, including a sensitivity analysis.
The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.
relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
Provisions Note 21 contains information about provisions.
provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are judgemental by their nature.
Amounts provided are the Groups best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Taxation The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgements as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the Group operates.
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on managements assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report on pages 8 to 45.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are described earlier in the Financial review.
In addition, note 19 includes the Groups policies and processes for managing financial risk: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements underpinned by the Groups new 200 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing October 2019.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and exchange rates, show the Group operating comfortably within its debt financial covenants for the next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to have an impact on the Group, its customers and suppliers.
The Board fully recognises the challenges that lie ahead but, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and Accounts.
Adoption of new and revised Standards During the period the Group has applied IFrS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFrS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFrS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011.
The adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements or the financial position of the Group.
Morgan aDVanCED MaTErIaLS annuaL rEporT 2014 100 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 101 1.
ACCouNTINg poLICIES, ESTIMATES AND juDgEMENTS continued New standards and interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and have not been applied in preparing the Group Financial Statements.
Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below.
The Group has not applied these standards early and, with the exception of IFrS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, does not expect the application of these standards to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
The impact of IFrS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is not currently known or reasonably estimable.
IFrS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or over time.
The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
IFrS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and reduces the number of primary measurement categories for financial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value.
These standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
ACquISITIoNS AND DISpoSALS Accounting policies Step acquisitions Step acquisitions arise when the Group acquires control of an entity through successive share purchases.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value on the date that control is acquired.
For step acquisitions occurring before 3 January 2010 the amount recognised as goodwill or negative goodwill is determined separately for each tranche acquired, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, in accordance with IFrS 3 Business Combinations 2004.
Any changes in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the acquisition date and the date that control is obtained are recorded in other reserves in equity to the extent that they have not previously been recognised in the income statement.
Any future step acquisitions would be accounted for in accordance with IFrS 3 Business Combinations 2008.
Acquisitions and disposals: 2014 Acquisition of Porextherm Dmmstoffe GmbH On 14 July 2014 the Group acquired all of the shares in porextherm Dmmstoffe GmbH porextherm, a leading producer of microporous insulation materials, for an enterprise value of 26.0 million, comprising cash purchase consideration of 17.7 million and the assumption of 8.3 million of debt.
There was no contingent consideration.
The addition of porextherm to the Morgan Group enhances the Groups existing portfolio of high-performance insulating systems, and also gives the Group the chance to share knowledge and process which will lead to future product development.
In line with the Groups strategic priorities, the acquisition brings with it the opportunity to explore new markets and expand the Groups range to benefit both new and existing customers.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below: 2014 m Trade and other receivables 2.3 Inventory 3.3 property, plant and equipment 5.6 Identifiable intangible assets 6.9 Trade and other payables 2.5 Net deferred tax liability 1.7 Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 6.9 Total identifable assets 7.3 Goodwill 6.8 Total consideration 14.1 Total consideration transferred was satisfied by cash.

ACquISITIoNS AND DISpoSALS continued The goodwill of 6.8 million arising from the acquisition consists of anticipated benefits from Morgan Group synergies.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of 0.4 million relating to external legal fees and due diligence costs.
These costs have been included in the Transaction-related costs line of specific adjusting items, part of the restructuring costs and other one-off items section of the consolidated income statement.
porextherm contributed 8.5 million third-party revenue and nil profit after taxation to the Group for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
The profit after taxation figure is stated after the deduction of adjustments as a result of applying IFrS 3 Business Combinations.
The Group estimates that porextherm achieved revenue of 20 million and profit after taxation of 1.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year 1 January 2014 management estimates that porextherm would have increased Group consolidated revenue for the 12 months ended 31 December 2014 by a further 9.7 million and Group consolidated profit for the period by a further 0.6 million before any adjustments to profit as a result of applying IFrS 3 Business Combinations.
other acquisitions and disposals: 2014 On 3 April 2014 the Group sold its uK fired shapes business to Jemmtec Limited trading as Magma Ceramics in exchange for a 35% shareholding in Jemmtec Limited, a fired ceramics shapes business.
Details of this disposal are given in note 6.
On 20 June 2014 the Group disposed of the whole of the share capital of Morgan AM&T Hairong Co. Limited for 0.3 million consideration.
The adjustment to the non-controlling interest component of equity due to this transaction was 1.2 million.
Acquisitions and disposals: 2013 On 1 February 2013 the Group purchased the remaining 25% of the share capital of Beijing Morgan Ceramics Co. Ltd BMC not already held by the Group for 0.3 million.

Loss on disposal of business On 28 December 2013 the Group disposed of 23.85% of the share capital of Assam Carbon products Ltd Assam for nil consideration.
As a result of the transaction the Group no longer has control of Assam and has therefore deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of Assam in these consolidated financial statements.
The loss recognised on the disposal of this shareholding was 2.3 million.
Based on the Groups remaining 28.8% shareholding the Group accounts for the shareholding as an associate.
The fair value of the Groups remaining investment has been measured at nil.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in OCI, in which case it is recognised in OCI.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

INTANgIbLE ASSETS continued Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2014 2013 m m North America 77.3 77.5 Europe 53.7 45.8 Asia rest of world 44.5 43.9 Composites and Defence Systems 16.4 175.5 183.6 Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating cash flow projections in year one.
The key assumptions that underpin these cashflow projections relate to sales and operating margins, which are based on past experience, taking into account the effect of known or likely changes in market or operating conditions.
Growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are specific to each cash-generating unit, ranging from 1.5% to 5.5% 2013: 1.0% to 5.0%.
The growth rates are also used to calculated a terminal value.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
These mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2014 and are considered to be appropriate.
In 2014 the Group has used the following pre-tax discount rates for calculating the terminal value of each of the new cash-generating units: North America 15.0%, Europe: 12.0%, Asia rest of world: 14.8%, Composites and Defence Systems: 14.0% 2013: 12.2%, 12.9%, 15.1%, 12.4%.
These discount rates have been used as the Group believes they suitably approximate the rates used by end-market participants.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise for each of the North America, Europe and Asia rest of world cash-generating units in any of the following three circumstances: if the pre-tax discount rate was increased to 30%: or if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value: or if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% 2013: 25%.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group recognised an impairment loss of 16.4 million on goodwill and 10.5 million on customer relationships in relation to Composites and Defence Systems cash-generating unit.
Following this impairment charge, the carrying amount of Composites and Defence Systems is equal to its recoverable amount.
The Group also disposed of 1.7 million of goodwill, 0.4 million of customer relationships and 3.0 million of technology and trademarks as part of the disposal of Morgan AM&T Hairong Ltd. All of these had nil net book value at the date of disposal.
Further details are given in note 6.
Additions to goodwill, order book, customer relationships, technology and trademarks are from the acquisition of porextherm Dmmstoffe GmbH.
Further details of this acquisition are given in note 2.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group recognised an impairment loss of 1.6 million on goodwill in relation to Morgan AM&T Hairong Ltd, which was identified when undertaking the exercise to review the composition of the cash-generating units following the internal organisation changes.
It also recognised an impairment loss of 0.3 million on customer relationships and 1.4 million of technology and trademarks in relation to Morgan AM&T Hairong Ltd. Morgan AM&T Hairong Ltd formed part of the Asia rest of world cash-generating unit.

For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 19.
Accounting policies Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Finance lease payments Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

FINANCIAL rISK MANAgEMENT This note presents information about the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity ie forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these Financial Statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2014 2013 m m Available-for-sale financial assets 1.6 2.7 Trade and other receivables 170.5 167.5 Cash and cash equivalents 63.0 76.0 235.1 246.2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

FINANCIAL rISK MANAgEMENT continued Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industries and countries in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2014 2014 2013 2013 m m m m Not past due 134.6 0.2 121.7 0.4 past due 0-30 days 19.5 0.1 27.0 0.3 past due 31-60 days 6.7 0.2 9.2 0.4 past due 61-90 days 12.0 3.5 11.5 3.9 past due more than 90 days 9.9 8.2 11.2 8.1 182.7 12.2 180.6 13.1 The only movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables was a decrease of 0.9 million 2013: increase of 0.5 million.
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash balances held by companies representing over 75% of the Groups revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements.
Cash balances throughout the Group are held with high-credit-quality financial institutions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out in accordance with the Treasury policy, which has been approved by the Audit Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Fixed rate instruments Variable rate instruments carrying amount carrying amount 2014 2013 2014 2013 Fixed rate instruments m m m m Financial assets 25.7 63.0 76.0 Financial liabilities 209.4 262.3 84.1 0.9 183.7 262.3 21.1 75.1 Interest rate risk is regularly monitored and reviewed taking into account the Groups overall borrowing costs, interest cover ratio and the relevant interest rate markets.
The fixed rate financial liabilities predominantly comprise the currency equivalent of 207.4 million 2013: 261.6 million of uS private placement Debt.
The average cost of the Groups fixed rate debt is 5.7% 2013: 5.6%.
The fixed rate financial assets comprise the currency equivalent of 25.7 million 2013: nil of a uSD receivable under a cross currency swap at 6.26%.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the Groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased profit by 0.5 million 2013: 0.7 million.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have increased profit by 0.2 million 2013: 0.5 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

FINANCIAL rISK MANAgEMENT continued Foreign currency risk The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-GBp borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

The Group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
Almost all of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 December 2014 was an asset of 0.6 million 2013: asset of 0.8 million.
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
The Group maintains in-country local currency borrowings, and has designated certain forward foreign exchange contracts and other borrowings as hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with investments in foreign operations.
In this way, the Group seeks to manage the translation exposure of overseas net assets, but only to the extent that its gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits, and provided the associated costs are not prohibitive.
The Groups currency split of total borrowings after the impact of net investment hedges was as follows: 2014 2013 m m GBp 6.3 6.6 uSD 160.3 196.2 82.2 51.4 Japanese Yen 7.5 8.0 Other 5.8 0.3 262.1 262.5 The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2014 is as follows: Based upon the currency profile of the groups net financial assets and liabilities, if GBp had strengthened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have increased by 21.6 million 2013: 18.1 million.
Conversely, if GBp had weakened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have reduced by 26.3 million 2013: 22.1 million.
Assuming the change occurred on the balance sheet date, there would be no impact on reported profit.
The impact of a weakening in GBp on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Based on the 2014 results, if in isolation the uSD average exchange rate for 2014 were 10% weaker, reported revenue and profit before tax would be 33.0 million 2013: 33.4 million and 4.3 million 2013: 3.8 million lower.
Based on the 2014 results, if in isolation the Eur average exchange rate for 2014 were 10% weaker, reported revenue and profit before tax would be 21.3 million 2013: 21.2 million and 2.7 million 2013: 2.7 million lower.

Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KpIs, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
The main KpI for the Group is the underlying operating profit margin.
The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double-digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys Ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings.

Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings are 1.8-3.8% 2013: 2.1-4.1% and finance leases 4.78% 2013: 6.0%.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and loans and receivables The Group has disclosed the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current loans and receivables and current payables at their carrying amount, given their notional amount is deemed to be their fair value.

EMpLoyEE bENEFITS Accounting policies i Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to either publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans, and the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is any retirement plan which is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans defined an amount of retirement benefit that an employee will receive, usually depending on one or more factors such as age, years of service and earnings.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
when the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
remeasurement gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in OCI in the year in which they arise.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Employee benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily in the uK, uSA and Europe and predominantly provide pensions based on service and career-average pay.
In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated in the uSA.

EMpLoyEE bENEFITS continued UK schemes In the uK, the Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morgan pension Scheme, and the Morgan Group Senior Staff pension and Life Assurance Scheme the uK Schemes.
The two uK Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees total service, and their career average earnings including allowance for Consumer price Inflation, although historically benefits were based upon an employees final salary.
Once in payment, pensions receive increases as set out in the rules, at either a fixed level, or in line with the retail price Index.
The overall duration of the uK Schemes is around 17 years.
The uK Schemes assets are held in trustee-administered funds governed by uK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees.
responsibility for the governance of the uK Schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies with the Board of Trustees who must consult with the Company on such matters.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company, plan participants and an independent trustee in accordance with the uK Schemes governing documents.
Funding legislation in the uK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every three years.
To the extent that there is a deficit against this measure, a payment schedule must be agreed such that the deficit is removed over a period of time, typically around 10 years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the uK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2013 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 82 million.
On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the uK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments totalling 7.1 million a year in 2014 15, increasing with 2.75% pa until 2023 and contributions in respect of future service as accrued.
The uK Schemes were closed to new entrants on 1 August 2011, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan Group personal pension plan, a defined contribution arrangement.
US schemes In the uSA, the Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes the uS Schemes.
The majority of these are qualified arrangements for tax purposes, although the Group also operates a Supplemental Executive retirement plan SErp which is not tax approved.
with the exception of the SErp, the uS Schemes are all frozen, with employees accruing benefits within a 401k arrangement.
The uS Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees service and earnings.
The benefits are level both prior to, and whilst in, payment.
Overall, the uS Schemes duration is around 13 years.
The qualified uS Schemes assets are held in a trust separately from the Groups assets.
For the SErp the Group holds an asset to meet the obligations, however due to its nature this is accounted for as a Group asset, rather than an asset of the SErp.
responsibility for the governance of the uS Schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with a management committee, all of whose members are appointed by the Group.
The funding requirements in the uSA, ErISA, require schemes to be fully funded at all times, and if not to target full funding within a period of seven years.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the funded uS Schemes were undertaken as at 1 January 2014 and resulted in a deficit of 14.2 million for one plan, and a surplus of 2.1 million in the smaller arrangement.
On the basis of these valuations, the Group made a 6.8 million payment in 2014 and will make payments of at least 5.1 million in 2015, 2.5 million in 2016 and a total of at least 8.3 million over the following five years.
As required, the amounts due will be revisited on an annual basis.
European schemes In Europe, the Group operates a number of retirement schemes, with the bulk of the obligations relating to arrangements for employees in Germany.
In line with local practice these arrangements are not funded for in advance, with benefits being met by the Group as they fall due.

EMpLoyEE bENEFITS continued The assumptions used are best estimate assumptions chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in practice.
The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long term and measured on external factors, based upon each plans duration.
In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the uK and uS is material to the cost of the promised benefits.
In both the uK and Europe, the assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.
Actuarial assumptions were: 2014 2014 2014 2014 Rest of UK USA Europe the World % % % % Discount rate 3.60 4.10 1.90 4.60 Inflation uK: rpI CpI 3.00 1.80 n a 1.70 n a Salary increase n a n a 2.20 5.00 pensions increase 2.90 3.10 3.70 n a 1.70 n a Mortality post-retirement: Life expectancy of a male retiring at age 60 in 2014 26.5 26.1 23.4 n a Life expectancy of a male retiring at age 60 in 2034 28.1 27.9 26.2 n a The actual liability in respect of global employee benefits will not be known until the last payments have been made.
In placing a current estimate on the Groups past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments to their arrangements.
The payments due are calculated based on local funding requirements, or in the case of the Groups unfunded arrangements on the incidence of benefit payments falling due.
The sensitivities of the Groups net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are: 2014 2013 Increase Increase effect effect Change in assumption m m Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 9.9 7.8 Inflation Increase by 0.1% 5.1 3.8 Mortality post-retirement pensioners live 1 year longer 16.2 15.1 Exchange rates GBp weakens against uSD by 10% 6.5 4.4 GBp weakens against Eur by 10% 3.6 3.1 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Groups schemes.

EMpLoyEE bENEFITS continued risks Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers.
Investment returns: The Groups net balance sheet, and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes.
Longevity: The cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements.
Inflation rate risk: In the uK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the uK Schemes population through the purchase of an insurance policy, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
remaining investment risks have also been mitigated to some extent by diversification of the return seeking assets and backing uninsured pensioner liabilities by bonds and swaps.
In addition, the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA rated corporate bonds, however the majority of the Groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 7.0 million 2013: 6.8 million.
The Group expects to contribute 7.1 million to these arrangements in 2015.
Share-based payments The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
under the Morgan Advanced Materials plc Long-Term Incentive plan LTIp and The Morgan Advanced Materials Bonus Deferral Share Matching plan BDSMp awards of shares are made to various key executives.
under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 ESOS 2004 share options were granted by the Company.
The Company also maintains a uK all-employee Sharesave scheme Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004.
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are met.

Group Earnings Before Interest, Tax and Amortisation EBITA the Groups revenue for any financial year less operating expenses, but measured before the impact of taxation, net financing costs and the effect of amortisation of intangible assets.
The remuneration Committee may also make further adjustments to exclude items which it does not, in its discretion, consider to reflect the underlying operating performance of the Group during the relevant financial years.
Group return on Capital Employed rOCE EBITA, divided by the capital employed at the end of the relevant financial year.
Group average return on Capital Employed rOCE EBITA, divided by the average of the capital employed at the end of the relevant financial years.
Divisional EBITA for the LTIp & BDSMp calculations Divisional revenue for the relevant financial years less operating costs including restructuring costs and other one-off items, but measured before the impact of taxation, net financing costs and the effect of amortisation of intangible assets at reported exchange rates.
The remuneration Committee may also make further adjustments to exclude items which it does not, in its discretion, consider to reflect the underlying operating performance of the Division during the relevant financial years.
Divisional average rOCE Divisional Earnings before net financing costs, taxation and amortisation of intangible assets EBITA, divided by the average of the Capital Employed by the Division at the end of the relevant financial years.

Awards will only vest therefore if the remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Groups and or Divisions pre-2012 LTIp awards only underlying financial performance over the performance period justifies vesting.
2010 LTIp Awards For LTIp awards granted to all participants in 2010, the extent to which 50% of the awards vested depended on the Companys TSr ranking against an appropriate comparator group over the period from 4 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.

2011 LTIp Awards For LTIp awards granted to the CEO, CFO and non-Divisional employees in 2011, the extent to which 50% of the awards vest depends on the Companys TSr ranking against an appropriate comparator group over the period from 3 January 2011 to 31 December 2013.
The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest depends on the growth in the Groups EpS compared with rpI between the 2010 base financial year and the 2013 financial year: TSr Element EpS Element TSr against FTSE All-Share Industrials Index % of award that vests EpS growth % of award that vests upper quartile 50% 15% pa 50% Median 15% 8% pa 15% Below median Nil 8% pa Nil To support the two-Divisional structure introduced in July 2010, the 2011 LTIp awards for senior Divisional executives were tailored to the value creation of each Division.
under these awards, the Divisional element is split into Divisional EBITA growth and Divisional average rOCE.
Vesting under the Divisional element only occurs when Divisional performance exceeds the threshold performance metrics under both measures.
Once the Divisional performance metrics exceed the threshold, the two elements are then measured independently.

There were no changes to the performance conditions of the LTIp awards granted to the CEO, CFO and non-Divisional employees in 2012.

For the 2012 LTIp awards granted to other executives in the former Morgan Ceramics and Morgan Engineered Materials Divisions in 2012, it was decided that a single set of Group performance metrics should apply to these participants.
The single set of Group performance metrics blends the performance metrics originally set for the two Divisions over the performance period as set out below.
The Group performance metrics are split into compound annual growth EBITA and Group average rOCE.
Vesting only occurs when Group performance exceeds the threshold performance metrics under both measures.
Once the Group performance metrics exceed the threshold, the two elements are then measured independently: Compound annual growth EBITA % of award that vests Group average rOCE % of award that vests 15% pa 50% 40.9% 50% 5.6% pa 15% 38.5% 15% 5.6% pa Nil 38.5% Nil The changes to the performance conditions attaching to the 2012 LTIp awards did not result in a change in the fair value at the measurement date.

The best estimate of the expenditure required to settled the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
