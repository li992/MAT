26 Contingent Liabilities Intellectual property litigation is commonplace in our industry and poses risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect or disrupt our business, customer relationships, expenses or results of operations.
We are regularly involved in pending and threatened litigation in the course of our business and industry, which litigation may be inherently uncertain.
With respect to both existing and future litigation, we will continue vigorously to defend ourselves and or take other steps as we believe are in the overall interests of CSR and its shareholders.
The Company and one of its subsidiaries are currently involved in a patent infringement case as disclosed below.
Other than this lawsuit, the Company and its subsidiaries are not involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the 12 months preceding the date of this report, a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Further, other than as disclosed below, due to inherent uncertainties, no accurate qualication of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings outlined below can be made.
CSR is one of four named defendants in a patent infringement case led by plaintiff Azure Networks, a patent portfolio non-practising entity, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on 13 January, 2015.
The case is in the initial stages and a trial date has not been set.
No provision has been recorded for the above-described case as cash outow has not been deemed probable.
During the course of our ongoing group legal entity rationalisation programme, we have become aware of a possible, but not probable, exposure relating to overseas tax with respect to a prior period restructuring.
CSRs best estimate of this contingent liability is $2.8 million.
No provision has been recorded for any of the cases above as cash outow has not been deemed probable.
