Governance Remuneration Report continued Post-Retirement Medical Benefits for Directors Certain current and former employees are eligible for continuing private medical insurance for themselves and their spouse dependents after retirement.
This includes certain current and former directors, including Neil Carson, Larry Pentz, John Walker, Bill Sandford, Pelham Hawker, Gordon Thorburn, Graham Titcombe and Chris Clark.
Payments for Loss of Office Bill Sandford received his salary, normal benefits and pension supplement up until 9th October 2013, being the date of his cessation of office.
The MDRC determined that it was appropriate to award Bill Sandford a bonus on a pro-rated basis, which amounted to 204,928, 20% of which was awarded as shares subject to a three year deferral period.
Mr Sandford was awarded 2,968 deferred shares under the annual bonus plan in 2012.
These will be released to him on the normal release date in 2015.
No bonus was paid in 2013 and so there are no deferred shares in respect of this year.
Shares allocated to Mr Sandford in July 2011 and July 2012 under the Johnson Matthey LTIP will be released to him on the normal vesting dates in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
The number of shares under these awards was, on leaving, pro-rated based on service completed since the start of the performance period to 21,411 and 11,895 shares.
The final vesting will be determined by reference to the achievement of the performance conditions.
No LTIP award was made to Mr Sandford in 2013.
