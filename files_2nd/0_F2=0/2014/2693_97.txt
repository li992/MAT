For liquidity risk exposure analysis purposes, the carrying amount of trade and other payables is the same as the contractual cash ows, with the contractual maturities of these financial liabilities all due in less than one year.
3.4 Impairment review Impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset or group of assets is greater than the present value of the cash they are expected to generate.
We perform annual impairment reviews of the carrying value of goodwill.
We consider the carrying value of other assets at least annually.
If there are triggers that indicate an impairment of other assets is possible, we then perform a full impairment review.
No impairment charges were recorded in 2013 14.

5 Annual report 2013 14 111 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.4 Impairment review continued Goodwill A review of the carrying value of goodwill has been performed as at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013.
In performing this review, the recoverable amount has been determined by reference to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of related businesses.
The key assumptions used by the Group in the calculation of value in use for its goodwill balances are the discount rate, revenue growth, operating cost margin and the level of capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level.
The Groups signi cant goodwill balances which are not impaired are discussed below: Carrying value at Terminal Continuing operations Reporting 31 March 2014 growth Pre-tax Year ended 31 March 2014 segment US$m rate discount rate 1 Monaco Telecom group Monaco 292 Between 0% and 1.5% Between 8.0% and 27.0% 2 The Bahamas Telecommunications CompanyCaribbean63 0% 10.1% Carrying value at Terminal Continuing operations Reporting 31 March 2013 growth Pre-tax Year ended 31 March 2013 segment US$m rate discount rate 1 Monaco Telecom group Monaco 246 Between 0% and 2.5% Between 8.0% and 23.0% 2 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company Caribbean 63 0% 9.3% 1 Monaco Telecom group: Three relevant cash-generating units CGUs were identi ed for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of Monaco Telecom domestic including the cable television business: international business and other services.
2 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company BTC : One relevant CGU has been identi ed for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of the BTC business.
The value in use was determined for each CGU by discounting management forecasts of future cash ows based on the approved three-year business plan extrapolated at long-term growth rates at pre-tax discount rates dependent on the risk-adjusted cost of capital of the diff erent parts of the business.
Management forecasts take account of the historical trading experience of the relevant business.
Sensitivity The value in use is sensitive to a number of input assumptions, in particular relating to net cash ow and the discount rates.
While the Group does not consider these scenarios to be reasonably possible, the value in use of the various CGUs in aggregate would not support the carrying value of the goodwill if: Monaco Telecom group net cash ows decreased by more than US$20 million per year or the discount rate increased by more than 9% above the pre-tax discount rate.
The Bahamas Telecommunications Company net cash ows decreased by more than US$8 million per year or the discount rate increased by more than 2% above the pre-tax discount rate.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles There were no events or changes in circumstances during the year to indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets that had been impaired.
112 Cable & Wireless Communications As at 31 March 2013, following a diffi cult year of trading and in the midst of challenging economic conditions, the Directors considered the performance of a number of our smaller island markets in the eastern Caribbean and the impact on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
As a result of the review an impairment charge of US$86 million was recorded across the islands noted below.
