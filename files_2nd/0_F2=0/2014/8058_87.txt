Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, with the exception of freehold land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured.
Except for freehold land and assets under construction, the cost of property, plant and equipment is written off on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected useful life of the asset.
For this purpose, expected lives are determined within the following limits: Freehold buildings: not more than 50 years: and Owned plant and equipment: not more than 15 years.
In general, production plant and equipment and office equipment are written off over ten years or less: motor vehicles and computer equipment over five years or less.
Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary, at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be appropriate.
Freehold land is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the assets carrying value with any sale proceeds, and are included in the income statement.
