Notes to the Accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
Due to the nature of estimation, the actual outcomes may well differ from these estimates.
The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Valuation of inventory Inventory is a significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group purchases commodities for use in the manufacture of soft drinks and these purchases are subject to price volatility.
As the Group uses standard costing to value its inventory, management review price variances arising from the purchases of commodities to ensure that the closing inventory correctly reflects the costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its current state and location.
Carrying value of brand support accruals The Group incurs significant costs in the support and development of the Groups brands.
Judgement is required in determining the level of closing accrual required at a year end for promotions and brand support campaigns that either span two financial years or where the costs have not been fully settled by the year end date.
This includes sales related discounts which are included within revenue as disclosed in the revenue recognition policy above.
Costs capitalised within property, plant and equipment The Group has significant property, plant and equipment additions in the year, much of this in relation to the commissioning of the new production and warehouse facility at Milton Keynes.
Judgement is required in assessing what expenditure should be capitalised as property, plant and equipment and in assessing the appropriate depreciation rates and estimated useful lives of such assets.
Judgement is also required in assessing the accounting treatment for a lease entered into by the Group for the plant at the Milton Keynes production facility.
In addition the following area of judgement had an effect of the carrying value of assets and liabilities: Retirement benefit obligations The determination of any defined benefit pension scheme surplus obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions used include discount rate, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality assumptions.
In addition, this year, judgement was required in relation to reviewing the impact of and accounting for an error identified in relation to the net assets figure reported by the actuary in relation to the balances reported at January 2013.
Further detail on this matter is included within note 25.
2 Segment reporting The Groups management committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
The management committee reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The management committee has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective.
This led to the operating segments identified in the table below: there has been no change to the segments during the year after aggregation.
The performance of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross profit before exceptional items.
Exceptional items are reported separately in note 6.
Year ended 26 January 2014 Other Still drinks including Carbonates and water ice-cream Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 197,868 55,097 1,120 254,085 Gross profit before exceptional items 99,153 16,363 640 116,156 A.

BARR p. l. c. 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Year ended 26 January 2013 Other Still drinks including iceCarbonates and water cream Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 182,921 53,639 1,035 237,595 Gross profit before exceptional items 92,519 14,827 658 108,004 There are no intersegment sales.
All revenue is from external customers.
Other segments represent income from water coolers for the Findlays 19 litre water business, rental income for vending machines, the sale of Rubicon ice-cream and other soft drink related items such as water cups.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is stated before exceptional costs as the Milton Keynes related exceptional costs allocated to cost of sales in the consolidated income statement relate to Carbonates only.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total profit before income tax, as shown in the consolidated income statement.
All of the assets and liabilities of the Group are managed by the management committee on a central basis rather than at a segment level.
As a result no reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to the statement of financial position has been disclosed for either of the periods presented.
Each of the following items are included in the reportable segments results and balances, and no adjustments are required in arriving at the costs included in the consolidated primary statements: 2014 2013 000 000 Capital expenditure 13,423 21,166 Depreciation and amortisation 6,698 6,772 Capital expenditure comprises cash additions to property, plant and equipment note 12.
All of the segments included within Carbonates and Still drinks and water meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
