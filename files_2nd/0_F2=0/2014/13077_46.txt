RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 90 Financial Statements 9 Goodwill and other intangible Assets continued The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and therefore are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
The net book amounts of indefinite and finite life intangible assets are as follows: 2014 2013 net book amount m m Indefinite life assets: Brands 7,826 7,606 Goodwill 3,258 3,285 Other 40 39 Total indefinite life assets 11,124 10,930 Finite life assets: Brands 23 25 Software 74 56 Other 31 130 Total finite life assets 128 211 Total net book amount of intangible assets 11,252 11,141 Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to either individual cash generating units CGUs, or groups of cash generating units together GCGUs.
The goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at the level at which identifiable cash inflows are largely independent.
Generally this is at a GCGU level, but for certain intangible assets this is at a CGU level.
Cash Generating Units After considering all the evidence available, including how brand and production assets generate cash inflows and how management monitors the business, the Directors have concluded that for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, the Groups GCGUs are as follows: health, hygiene, home, and food.
During the year, the integration of recent acquisitions within the health category has largely been completed.
As a result, for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing in 2014, the health Sexual Wellbeing and health VMS CGUs have been combined with the health GCGU, to form a wider health GCGU.
An impairment test was performed on each of these CGUs prior to integration and both were assessed to have a recoverable value in excess of their carrying value.
An analysis of the net book value of indefinite life assets and goodwill by GCGU is shown below: 2014 2013 indefinite Indefinite life assets Goodwill Total life assets Goodwill Total GCGU key brands m m m m m m 1 Health Airborne, Durex, Gaviscon, MegaRed, Move Free, Mucinex, Nurofen, Scholl, Strepsils 5,928 3,066 8,994 5,752 3,094 8,846 Hygiene Bang, Clearasil, Dettol, Finish, Harpic, Lysol, Mortein, Veet 1,156 147 1,303 1,082 149 1,231 Home Air Wick, Calgon, Vanish, Woolite 750 45 795 781 42 823 Food Frenchs 32 32 30 30 7,866 3,258 11,124 7,645 3,285 10,930 1 Within the health GCGU, the cashflows in relation to certain groups of brands are separately identifiable.
As a result, the carrying value of these brand-related intangible assets have been tested for impairment as CGUs, in addition to the impairment testing over goodwill and indefinite life assets for the wider GCGU.
The CGUs tested separately are shown below, all of which fall under the health GCGU in the above table.

As such the disclosures below do not include discussion on the assumptions specific to Food.
Newly acquired goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment in the first year following acquisition in isolation.
For 2014, K-Y was assessed to have a recoverable value in excess of its carrying value.
Annual impairment review The annual impairment review of goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on an assessment of each GCGU or CGUs value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections, based on historical operating results, and the short-term budgets and medium-term business plans which have been approved by management covering a four-year period, with an extrapolated fifth year.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from restructuring not yet implemented.
The value in use calculation is based on the following key assumptions used in the cash flow projections: Net revenue growth based upon future sales volumes and prices, which take account of the expected impact from committed new product initiatives, expansion into new markets and the maturity of the markets in which each CGU operates: Gross margin based on historical experience adjusted for the impact of production costs, cost optimisation initiatives and changes in product mix: and Marketing and other expenditure, reflecting historical experience, expected levels of cost inflation, committed cost saving initiatives and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rates stated below.
Individual long-term growth rates are applied to each product segment within a GCGU or CGU, and such ranges are provided.
The long-term growth rates applied do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products and market in which the GCGU or CGU operates.
Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual GCGU and CGU.
This has been done using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group, adjusted for risks specific to each GCGU and CGU.
Due to the wide geographic and product diversification of their respective markets, and the diverse risks associated with a number of GCGUs and CGUs, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% was determined for each of the health, hygiene and home GCGUs and the Sexual Wellbeing CGU 2013: 11%.
The VMS and Oriental Pharma CGUs are predominantly concentrated in single markets, being the US and China respectively.
A pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2013: 14% was therefore applied to VMS and 14% 2013: 14% was applied to Oriental Pharma, to reflect the risks specific to these businesses.

Any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the health, hygiene and home GCGUs, or the Sexual Wellbeing and K-Y CGUs, are based would not imply possible impairments.
With a recoverable amount exceeding its carrying value by 116m 14% 2013: 19m, 2%, the VMS CGU is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
This is expected of an acquisition where the acquired intangible assets were recently valued at fair value.
The sensitivity of the recoverable amount has been assessed to identify the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
If all other assumptions were held constant, a reduction in assumed growth rates in the first five years by 25% of those planned would lead to a reduction in the value in use of this CGU of 77m.
In addition, a further reduction of 100 bps in the terminal growth rate would result in an additional reduction in the value in use of 61m.
Applying these sensitivities together would result in the carrying value of this CGU exceeding its value in use by 21m.
The recoverable amount of the Oriental Pharma CGU exceeds its carrying value by 23m 20%, and as such is also sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
If all other assumptions were held constant, a reduction in assumed growth rates in the first five years by 25% of that planned would lead to a reduction in the value in use of this CGU of 33m.
In addition, a further reduction of 100 bps in the terminal growth rate would result in an additional reduction in the value in use of 9m.
Applying these sensitivities together would result in the carrying value of this CGU exceeding its value in use by 19m.
