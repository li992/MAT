Segmental information The Group has determined its operating segments based on the management information including trading revenue and trading operating profit reviewed on a regular basis by the Companys board.
The Group considers the executive members of the Companys board to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Group reviews the composition of the operating segments at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether they remain appropriate.
In September 2012, ICAP created the Global Broking division, an amalgamation of ICAPs three regional voice broking businesses, to streamline the management of Global Broking businesses around the Group.
Reporting of information to the CODM under the new structure took effect in June 2013, when Global Broking was reported as one segment in addition to Electronic Markets and Post Trade Risk and Information, which continue to be the other two operating segments.
The change is reflected in the segmental information table below, where the prior year comparatives have been re-presented.
The change in the reporting structure also resulted in a change in identification of cash generating units for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing see note 14.
Revenue comprises brokerage or access fees from its Electronic Markets business, fees from the provision of Post Trade Risk and Information services and commission from the Groups Global Broking business.
Electronic Markets The Group acts as a broker for FX, interest rate derivatives, fixed income products and CDS through the Groups electronic platforms.
Revenue is generated from brokerage fees which are dependent on the average trading volumes.
The Group also charges fees to use the electronic trading platform for access to liquidity in the FX or precious metal markets.
Post Trade Risk and Information The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information and provision of post trade risk and information services to third parties.
These are stated net of value added tax, rebates and other sales taxes and recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade receivables within trade and other receivables note 17.
Global Broking Matched principal and stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in a non-advisory capacity as principals in the matched purchase and sale of securities and other financial instruments between our customers.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the commitment by our customers to sell and purchase the security or financial instrument.
The revenue generated by the stock lending business is not material to the Group.
Agency business name give-up The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal in name give-up transactions and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
For the shipbroking business, the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of services and recognises revenue, net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is a completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
Execution on exchange business The Group also acts as a broker of exchange listed products, where the Group executes customer orders as principal and then novates the trade to the underlying customers respective clearing broker for settlement.

Governance and Strategic report Financial statements Other information directors report ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 111 4.
Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted EPS for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates trading EPS from the trading profit.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement for assessing ICAPs performance since it better reflects the businesss trading earnings.
The diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting share capital in issue for additional weighted average number of ordinary shares that are likely to be issued under various employee share award schemes as of the balance sheet date.
Weighted average number of ordinary shares excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 17m 2012 13 18m and those owned by employee share trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 6m shares 2012 13 6m.

The directors have proposed a final dividend of 15.4p per share for the year ended 31 March 2014.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 103m.
Therefore, subject to shareholders approval of the proposed final dividend of 15.4p per share, the full-year dividend will be 22.0p per share, which will be covered 1.5 times 2012 13 1.5 times by trading EPS of 33.2p 2012 13 33.0p.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts and no dividend is payable on Treasury Shares.

Under the terms of the settlements, IEL paid penalties of $65m to the CFTC and 14m to the FCA, totalling 55m.
A provision of 9m was recorded during the year with respect to a potential settlement by Link with the SEC.
The remaining 12m exceptional costs relate to legal and professional fees associated with the investigations noted above.
Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Calculations of current and deferred tax liability have been based on ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities, managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

Employee information and expense ICAP operates a number of pension plans throughout the Group including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as they fall due.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of its employee incentive schemes as well as other share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the grant date and is charged to employee expenses over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding amount is recognised in equity.

Interest rate risk exposure The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound sterling, euro, yen and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise its interest cost and the impact of interest rate volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.
At 31 March 2014, after taking into account the impact of cross currency swaps and FX swaps, the interest rate profile of the Groups cash and debt was as follows.

Net finance expense continued A 100 basis-points parallel increase in pound sterling Libor and Libid rates, which the Group considers to be an appropriate sensitivity measure, would decrease net finance costs by 2m.
An equal impact would result from a similar movement in dollar rates.
In the event that Libor and Libid rates each diverge by an additional 100 basis-points in the pound sterling rate, net finance costs would increase by 4m.
A 2m increase would result from the same movement in the dollar rate.
Company The Company is only exposed to interest rate movements as a result of a loan from a subsidiary of 140m.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basispoint movement in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the net finance costs of the Company.
Borrowings Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates, long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

These senior notes were issued at a re-offer price of 99.654 and are presented on the balance sheet at amortised cost, net of fees.
To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross-currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of 250m of the notes from euros to pound sterling at an FX rate of 1.21.
These swap 250m of the notes from a fixed effective euro interest rate of 3.20% to a fixed pound sterling interest rate of 4.39%.
The swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and at 31 March 2014 have a fair market value of 1m and they offset the effect of FX on the notes.
This resulted in a nil charge 2012 13 nil being recognised in the consolidated income statement and a nil credit 2012 13 nil in other comprehensive income during the year.
The remaining 100m of the notes remain in euros and have been designated as a net investment hedge of the Groups euro denominated net assets.
In June 2013, the Group refinanced its $880m RCF with a 425m RCF provided by eight banks.
This new RCF has a maturity date of December 2016 and incorporates a $200m swingline facility of which $75m is available as a late day fronted solution.
The drawings under the RCF as at 31 March 2014 were nil 2012 13 nil.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.5% 2012 13 2.2%.
Additionally, in May 2013 the Group issued a 15m senior note with a coupon of 4.3% and a maturity in 2023.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
Included in these, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
The Group and Company remained in compliance with the terms of all its covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2014.

These loans have been refinanced either immediately on maturity or a few days thereafter with similar terms.
The most recent loan was repaid on 27 March 2014.
In September 2013, the Group entered into a one-year term loan agreement of 50m.
This loan was drawn down in September 2013 and repaid in March 2014.
The carrying value of the five-year senior notes of 246m 2012 13 255m has been reclassified as short-term borrowings at 31 March 2014 as they mature in July 2014.
The carrying value of the notes includes a fair value hedging adjustment to decrease the carrying value by 9m 2012 13 3m increase.
On issuance, the Group entered into a number of cross-currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of the notes from euros to pound sterling at an FX rate of 1.16.

Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of customers client monies in accordance with local regulatory rules.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to customers.
Restricted funds comprise cash held with a CCP clearing house, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for regulatory purposes, but excluding client money.
The funds represent cash for which the Group does not have immediate and direct access or for which regulatory requirements restrict the use of the cash.

The balance fluctuates based on business events around the year end and increased during the year by 2m to 39m at 31 March 2014.
Capital and liquidity planning and management The Group does not seek to take proprietary market risk positions, so does not seek to expose its capital to market risk, and it does not undertake any form of maturity transformation so does not seek liquidity risk.
Thus, the overall approach to the planning and management of the Groups capital and liquidity is to ensure the Groups solvency, i. e. its continued ability to conduct business, deliver returns to shareholders and support growth and strategic initiatives.
This risk profile meets the necessary conditions for an investment firm consolidation waiver and the Group continues to benefit from a waiver under the CRD IV provisions in force since 1 January 2014.
Liquidity Group The Group incurs exposure to liquidity risk as a result of trades executed as principal and trades executed on exchange on behalf of clients.
As principal trades are executed as matched principal they give rise to no net funding requirement in the normal course of business and the liquidity requirements arise only in relation to the margin and collateral requirements of clearing houses, either directly or via financial institutions which provide ICAP with access to the clearing houses.
Governance and Strategic report Financial statements Other information directors report ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 121 12.
Capital and liquidity planning and management continued Liquidity continued Group continued In order to execute and clear matched principal trades in securities the relevant entities need access to clearing and settlement facilities, which requires access to credit during the settlement cycle, so typically only for a one to three day period.
In order to execute trades in on-exchange derivatives the entities need access to credit facilities to carry the trades until they are taken up by customers.
In both cases, the Group can be required to post collateral or margin to support the credit lines, so access to liquidity is needed to ensure trades can continue to be supported uninterrupted.
The most significant margin requirements arise in the US where, as part of its broking business, ICAP provides clearing services to customers and is required to deposit margin with the FICC and NSCC.
Following the introduction of a new clearing arrangement for US Treasuries in the prior year February 2013 US margin requirements have been significantly reduced and deposits averaged $15m during the year compared with $36m in the prior year.
Trading entities of the Group use locally held highly liquid assets, predominantly cash held to meet capital requirements, together with committed and uncommitted credit facilities to meet their liquidity requirements.
The Group has a centralised approach to the provision of contingency funding for its trading entities.
Through the GRACC, the board regularly reviews the liquidity demands of the Group and the financial resources available to meet these demands.
The GRACC ensures that the Group, in totality and by subsidiary, has sufficient liquidity available in order to provide constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
Therefore, to meets its liquidity requirements, the Group has maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of centrally held cash and undrawn debt facilities, of $250m throughout the year.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had gross debt of 787m 2012 13 577m, the maturity analysis of which is set out in note 10, and cash and cash equivalents of 703m 2012 13 602m see note 11 c. Cash has increased from 31 March 2013 due to funds raised as a result of the issue of the 350m senior notes in advance of the maturity in July 2014 of the 246m senior notes.
Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, to which the Group has no immediate access in practice is disclosed as restricted funds in the financial statements see note 11 e. The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA-rated liquidity funds, and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to counterparty credit risk and liquidity.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the GRACC in conjunction with the risk function.
Company The Companys policy is to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of liquidity to enable it to finance its forecast ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intraGroup for further investment.
With the exception of the retail bond of 125m due 2018, and the 15m bond due 2023, all of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within three months.
Capital management The Groups capital strategy is to maintain an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining flexibility and ensuring compliance with supervisory regulatory requirements.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt see note 10 and equity, including share capital see note 24, share premium, other reserves see note 25 and retained earnings.
The Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient regulatory capital at Group level and in individual regulated trading entities to meet regulatory requirements.
The Group has regulated subsidiaries in approximately 40 countries, most notably the UK and the US, and is subject to consolidated supervision by the FCA.
On 1 January 2014 the provisions of CRD IV came into force.
The rules preserved the derogation for the FCA to waive the application of the consolidated capital requirements.
The FCA has confirmed the grandfathering of our existing waivers which fall due for renewal in April 2016.
The requirements of the waiver are equivalent under CRD IV to the pre-existing BIPRU rules which prevent the Group from taking proprietary positions.
The Group continues to comply with these requirements.
The waiver modifies the calculation of the Group regulatory capital position, in effect excluding goodwill adjustments from the capital computation and, in so doing, allows the Group to undertake acquisitions using debt rather than equity finance.
As a result of the waiver, the Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital headroom represents the difference between the capital resources of the Company, on a stand-alone basis, and the regulatory capital requirements of the Group calculated, in accordance with the requirements of the waiver, on an aggregate basis.
Pillar 1 headroom is approximately 0.9bn 2012 13 0.9bn and is relatively stable due to the low amount of market and credit risk in the Group, but may fluctuate due to the timing of dividends and the distribution of subsidiaries profits to the Company.
122 ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 12.
Capital and liquidity planning and management continued Capital management continued Regulatory capital at solo entity level depends on the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and operates.
In each case the approach is to hold an appropriate surplus over the local minimum.
The highest capital requirements arise in the UK, where they are predominantly driven by the fixed overhead requirement, which is based on the fixed costs of the prior year and so does not fluctuate significantly within the year.
As the Group does not take proprietary positions it does not have an inventory of assets so regulatory capital is mostly represented by cash.
ICAP also evaluates at a Group and individual legal entity level the risks facing the business, to determine whether its capital is sufficient to cover any expected losses.
The Group uses a scenario-based model which assesses the economic capital required to cover expected risks.
The process followed at Group level is consistent with the CRD requirement for ICAPs FCA regulated entities to perform an internal capital adequacy assessment ICAAP under Pillar 2.
The results for both are documented, updated and approved annually by the board and the UK regulated entity boards respectively.
The Group overall and each regulated trading company complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
In general, higher levels of market volatility result in increased demand for the Groups services.
However, as the regulatory capital requirement is driven predominantly by the fixed cost base the impact of changes in volumes on the capital requirement is significantly dampened.
As such, absent a material acquisition, loss of the waiver or a change in the basis of computation, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to both operate and grow the business.
Intangible assets arising from development expenditure Development expenditure on software is recognised as an intangible asset in accordance with the provisions of IAS38 Intangible Assets.
Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at cost and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within trading operating expenses.
Amortisation is charged against assets from the date at which the asset becomes available for use.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation Since 1 April 2004, intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and customer contracts that arose on business combinations.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column acquisition and disposal costs.
The Group reviews the performance of the acquired businesses and reassesses the period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the carrying value.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures, when the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree exceed the amount of the identifiable net assets acquired.
If the amount of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in associates when the cost of investment exceeds ICAPs share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets and liabilities.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included in Interests in associates and is not tested separately for impairment.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and are adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment.
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated income statement.
All intangible assets have a finite life.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 210 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset for which the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indicator of impairment.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a CGU at acquisition for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The identification of CGUs is reviewed where there is a significant change to the Groups segmental reporting structure.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of a CGU is based on the assets and liabilities of each CGU, including attributable goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use VIU.
VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its VIU, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This process requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

The other intangible assets at 31 March 2014, all represent customer relationships and have varying remaining amortisation periods across CGUs.
During the year, goodwill and other intangible assets formerly attributed to 20 smaller Global Broking businesses were aggregated and reviewed for impairment at a single Global Broking CGU level.
This change in the identification of CGU reflects the creation of Global Broking division to enable the Group to execute a global strategy for all voice broking businesses and is in line with the change in the reporting structure as discussed in note 1.
The rationale for the aggregation of goodwill was presented to the Audit Committee, where the appropriateness was debated and approved.
Prior to the aggregation, individual goodwill balances in Global Broking were reviewed for impairment indicators, which resulted in a 7m impairment losses recognised in the year.
The remaining 4m of impairment losses relate to the writing off of goodwill attributable to two small Electronic Markets businesses.

Impairment testing methodology The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined using VIU calculations, which are based on discounting managements pre-tax cash flow projections for the CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital WACC ICAP allocates to investments in the businesses within which the CGU operates.
A long-term growth rate estimate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term nature of the businesses in the CGUs.
For the 2013 14 annual impairment testing, managements cash flow projections for the year ending 31 March 2015 were used.
As a result of the sale of a stake in Traiana during the year, the business was subject to a full external valuation which was in excess of the net book value.
For this reason, an annual impairment review of Traiana was not conducted.

Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Discount rates The Groups pre-tax WACC was 9.3% 2012 13 10.7%, reflecting a downward revision of the market risk premium estimate.
The Group WACC is a function of the Groups cost of equity, derived using a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM, and the Groups cost of debt.
The cost of equity estimate depended on inputs in the CAPM reflecting a number of variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These inputs are based on the markets assessment of economic variables and management judgement, which are subject to scrutiny by the Governance committees, including the GRACC and the Audit Committee see page 60.
All inputs to the CAPM model were externally sourced.
The CGU specific WACCs were then derived by adjusting the Group WACC for business specific risk factors.
Nominal long-term growth rate The growth rate reflects weighted average GDP growth and inflation for the countries within which the CGUs operate.
The rates are based on International Monetary Funds medium-term forecast growth rates as they are deemed to be a reliable estimate of likely future trends.
The rates applied do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy or, for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions included in the cash flow projections of the CGUs are discussed below: BrokerTec BrokerTec cash flow projections are largely predicated on continued growth of the on-the-run US Treasury actives market and forecasted improvement in the volume of UST off-the-run trading.
The key challenges to the cash flow projections arise from potential increased competition in the US Treasury active market space and from uncertainty around how regulatory reforms, such as higher capital requirements for banks, will affect the US and European repo markets.
EBS The key assumptions included in the cash flow projections for EBS are that the new initiatives and growth areas, including EBS Direct, will continue to drive revenue in 2014 15 and the projections are also based on EBS Markets growing market share in emerging market currencies.
The key challenge to the cash flow projections is a worse than anticipated decrease in EBS Market revenue driven by a decrease in FX market activity.
Reset The cash flow projections for Reset is predicated on expected positive changes to the macroeconomic environment in 2014 15, specifically some sporadic or small increase in the volatility expectations.
Our ability to achieve the budgeted cash flow for Reset could be challenged if central banks continue their policy of quantitative easing and low and stable interest rates.
TriOptima The key assumption included in the cash flow projections for TriOptima reflect continued growth anticipated in triResolve revenues as new subscribers continue to join the service in response to significant changes in our customers regulatory requirements.
The key risk to our cash flow projections is a worse than expected performance in triReduce as the market migrates to CCPs where the compression value proposition is lesser than for bilateral trades.
Global Broking The cash flow projections for Global Broking are based on managements assumption that the challenging market conditions experienced in many asset classes in 2013 14 will continue in 2014 15.
The trading activity levels in the last quarter of the financial year indicate that while ICAP continues to hold significant market share, the decline in revenue is consistent with general market trends.
The key risk to the 2014 15 cash flow assumptions arise from worsening market volumes and brokerage rates and the impact of short-term uncertainties arising from regulatory reforms continue to be felt next year.
Based on the conditions at the balance sheet date and having assessed sensitivities of the key assumptions, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of those key assumptions noted above would not cause an impairment in any of CGUs.

Since then Link has continued to co-operate with the SECs investigation.
Link closed its cash desk in 2010, and ceased all commercial operations in April 2013.
Regulatory matters include a provision of 9m recorded at 31 March 2014 in respect of any potential settlement by Link with the SEC as a result of the former brokers conduct.
The remaining 4m regulatory matters provision made during the year relates to estimated professional services fees to comply with the orders in the undertakings that were agreed with the CFTC, as part of reaching settlement on the yen Libor investigations.
Legal provisions represent amounts for certain claims brought against subsidiaries of the Group in relation to certain tax matters and the provisions have been acquired by the Group on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings.
Based on the developments in the year, management determined that as at 31 March 2014, the probability of an economic outflow relating to certain legal provisions were less than remote, hence released 3m to the income statement.
At the present time, the timing of any payment is uncertain and the matters are reviewed by the Group on a regular basis.
It is unlikely that the outcome of these legal claims will give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 March 2014.

Additionally, contingent liabilities also include present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.
Contingent liability On 25 September 2013, ICAP Europe Limited IEL, one of ICAPs Global Broking division's subsidiaries, reached settlement agreements with the FCA and the CFTC relating to the involvement of certain brokers in the attempted manipulation of yen Libor by bank traders.
ICAP continues to respond to requests from several government agencies in relation to the setting of yen Libor, including ongoing investigations being conducted by the Competition Directorate of the European Commission.
IEL does not believe that it has breached EU competition laws, however it is not practicable to predict the ultimate outcomes of these investigations or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.
IEL continues to work closely and co-operate fully with an ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice relating to the Libor matters.
The US Department of Justice has not taken action against IEL nor any other ICAP company to date.
Based on ICAPs present assessment of this matter, no provision has been made.
In addition, ICAP plc is a named defendant in three civil litigations against various Libor and Tibor setting banks in the US.
It is not practicable to predict the ultimate outcomes of these litigations or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group, but the Company intends to defend the claims vigorously.
ICAP continues to co-operate with the CFTCs inquiries into the setting of USD ISDAFIX rates.
ICAP Capital Markets LLC was the collection agent for ISDAFIX panel bank submissions in dollar up until January 2014, when the collection process was changed by ISDA.
It is not practicable to predict the ultimate outcome of this investigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact on the Group.
From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters.
It is also frequently required or requested to retain and or provide transaction records and other information to regulators and other government agencies as part of informal and formal inquiries or market reviews.
It is not practicable to quantify the extent of any potential liabilities in litigation, nor identify the purpose or outcome of any regulatory requests, but currently there are none expected to have a material adverse impact on the Groups consolidated results or net assets.
Contractual commitments Operating lease commitments At the end of the financial year, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases which fall due as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2014 2013 m m Within one year 24 16 Between one and five years 71 83 After five years 30 41 125 140 No amounts were expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases as at 31 March 2014 2012 13 nil.
Operating lease commitments relate to the rental of premises for office space in the UK, US, Israel and Asia Pacific, in the locations that the Group operates.
Guarantees In the normal course of business certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover clearing and settlement arrangements and or the use of third party services software.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group has given 357m 2012 13 354m of guarantees to counterparties.
ICAP plc has provided a subordinated guarantee to a subsidiary company in respect of the $193m subordinated loan notes repayable in 2015.
The fair value of the guarantee at 31 March 2014 was immaterial.
Governance and Strategic report Financial statements Other information directors report ICAP plc Annual Report 2014 129 17.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost less any provision for recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in the currency risk management note note 26.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our customers.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when all sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables note 18, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
If any unmatched trades remain outstanding, the asset or liability is held within matched principal trade receivables or payables as appropriate and fair valued through the consolidated income statement until the trade is completed.
The Group acts as an intermediary between our customers for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due to and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned note 18.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

The risk in respect of name give-up, post trade risk and information services businesses is limited to the collection of outstanding commission and transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Groups credit control function: the exposure to credit loss is limited to the value of the receivable.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.
The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk, including setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparts which are stringently monitored by the regional credit risk teams to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default.
The credit risk on core cash, cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are monitored on a daily basis.
All financial institutions that are transacted with are approved by GRACC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors, including external credit ratings.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents is deposited with financial institutions rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies.
Approximately 85% of the Groups counterparty exposure at any given point throughout the year is to investment grade counterparts rated BBBBaa3 or above.
The Groups potential stressed counterparty credit risk calculated in the ICAAP is less than 5% of the total Group capital.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets plus other off-balance sheet items as disclosed below: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2014 2013 m m Financial assets of the Group note 19 23,648 17,473 Guarantees given to counterparties 357 354 24,005 17,827 Company The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
This risk is considered minimal as all counterparties are Group companies and the risk of non-payment is viewed as low.

Trade and other receivables continued b Impairment of other trade receivables Other trade receivables represent amounts receivable in respect of agency business and information services.
All receivables are individually assessed for impairment at the reporting date.
Management judgement is applied in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and, if so, the measurement of the impairment allowance.
In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement is exercised in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, which is not restricted to the consideration of whether payments are contractually past due but includes broader consideration of factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of customers affecting their ability to pay.
For those receivables where objective evidence of impairment exists, management determines the size of the allowance required based on a range of factors, including probability of default and, if defaulted, expectation of recovery.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 March 2014, 3m of other trade receivables remain impaired 2012 13 3m.
There have been no new impairments during the year.
Past due but not impaired trade and other receivables are those in respect of which the debtor has failed to make a payment or a partial payment in accordance with the contractual terms of the invoice, but there is no major concern over the creditworthiness of the counterparty, hence not impaired.
In the prior reporting periods, receivables past a normal settlement date were considered past due and were reported on that basis.
As of 1 April 2013, the Group realigned the age grouping of receivables to reflect better how management monitors aged receivables internally.
As at 31 March 2014, the following trade and other receivables were past due but not impaired: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2014 2013 m m Less than 30 days overdue 108 120 Over 30 days, but less than 90 days overdue 59 56 Over 90 days, but less than 180 days overdue 10 13 Over 180 days overdue 12 9 As at 31 March 189 198 The prior year comparatives have been re-presented to enable comparability.
c Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Under a clearing arrangement for certain US matched principal transactions on a fully disclosed clearing basis, the Group has the legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and settle on a net basis.
As such, certain matched principal trade receivables and payables were recorded on a net basis.

b Contingent deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions A number of acquisitions made by the Group are satisfied in part by contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due where necessary, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill for acquisitions made prior to the adoption of IFRS3 revised Business Combinations.
For acquisitions made since the adoption of IFRS3 revised, any adjustments made to the contingent deferred consideration are made through the acquisition and disposals costs column of the consolidated income statement.
Included within contingent deferred consideration are amounts which are exercisable at certain dates in the future on put options written over shares held by non-controlling interests where the Group considers it highly likely that these options will be exercised.
At 31 March 2014, contingent deferred consideration of 5m 2012 13 9m was outstanding.

Principal subsidiaries and joint ventures An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Company has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The Company recognises investments in subsidiaries initially at fair value, and subsequent changes in value as a result of impairment are recognised in the income statement.
a Investment in subsidiaries Company The Companys immediate subsidiary companies are ICAP Group Holdings plc, Intercapital Limited and Garban Group Holdings Limited, all of which are incorporated in England and Wales and are 100% owned by the Company.

The Group determined that as a result of these adoptions the joint ventures results will not be proportionately consolidated in the Group financial statements but will be treated under the equity accounting method.
If IFRS11 and amendments to IAS28 were applied in the current year, Groups revenue and operating expenses would have been 19m and 14m lower respectively.
Groups profit before tax and tax charge would have both been 1m lower.
However, there would be no impact on the Groups profit for the year as 4m income from joint ventures net of tax would have recorded after the Groups operating profit.

Investment in associates Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method.
Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets.
Investments in associates are reviewed for indicators of impairment under IAS39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Whenever application of IAS39 indicates that an investment may be impaired, the carrying amount of the investment, including attributed goodwill, is tested for impairment as a single asset under IAS36, by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sale.

The difference in these associates year ends to the Groups year end is not considered to have a material impact on their results.
All other associates have a 31 March year end.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments in equity assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, are subsequently recorded at cost less impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on such financial assets, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
All other available-for-sale financial assets are fair valued subsequently at each period end.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement for an investment in an available-for-sale equity instrument are not reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity investments are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
When an available-for-sale financial asset is derecognised, any cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.

Currency risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exist for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the accounting for the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
For periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign-denominated investment.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
The principal exchange rates which affect the Group are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.

Currency risk management continued Group continued i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for all subsidiaries to hedge their material non-functional currency transactional exposures through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
The majority of these exposures relate to dollar and euro sales arising in pound sterling functional currency companies.
The Group revised its hedging policy during the year such that, under the revised policy, a minimum of 75% of the forecast exposures are hedged for the first six months, 50% for the following six months and 25% for the next six months.
The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, with a total notional value of 17% of its forecast dollar and 28% of its forecast euro transactional exposures for the year to 31 March 2015.
These contracts are at average rates of $1.5955 and 1.1717 respectively.
ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
Where material, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts.
Cross currency swaps have therefore been used to hedge both the FX and the interest rate risks of the Group in relation to the 300m of five-year senior notes note 10 a.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups non-pound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pound sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenure than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate these exposures.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group has the subordinated loan notes, 100m of the 2019 five-year senior notes and the 2023 ten-year senior notes, designated as hedging instruments against the underlying dollar and euro exposures respectively.
As at 31 March 2014, these exposures were $1.6bn 2012 13 $1.4bn and 0.2bn 2012 13 0.2bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.2bn 2012 13 $0.3bn and 0.1bn 2012 13 nil of hedging.
The Group disclosed in note 2 the actual impact and anticipated impact on the Groups 2013 14 operating profit from the movements during the year of the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposures.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups equity of movements in the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposures.
The table below also discloses the anticipated impact on the Groups equity of a 10 cent weakening, which the Group considers to an appropriate sensitivity measure, in the dollar and euro in terms of transactional and translational exposure.

Currency risk management continued Group continued iii Derivative financial instruments Among other methods, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to implement its FX policy.
These include the use of forward FX contracts to hedge a portion of its transactional dollar and euro exposures and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the FX and interest rate risks on its senior notes.
Where these are designated and documented as cash flow hedges in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on recognition of the underlying item being hedged.

Company Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
At 31 March 2014, the Company had 12m financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which related to its ten-year senior notes 2012 13 nil.
