For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Underlying earnings per share figures are presented to exclude the effect of exceptional and other adjusting items.
The Directors consider that the supplementary figures are a useful indicator of performance.
