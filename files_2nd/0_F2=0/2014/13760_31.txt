Where a derivative ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedging instrument or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold, matures or is extinguished, hedge accounting is discontinued and amounts previously recorded in equity are recycled to the profit and loss account.
A similar treatment is applied where the hedge is of a future transaction and that transaction is no longer likely to occur.
When the hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
