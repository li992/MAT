perforManCe MeasUres anD tarGets aUDIteD The central feature of the Remuneration Policy is the Annual Award Pool.
All incentives are governed by an overall limit expressed in terms of cash profit.
The table below includes the cost of incentives drawn from the Annual Award Pool for the financial year under review and the two previous years.
Annual Award Spend on Cash profit Pool incentives FY m m m 2012 164.9 49.5 29.5 2013 10.7 3.2 22.1 2014 339.1 101.7 50.2 The calculation of cash profit has been reviewed and as a result adjusted.
A change has been made to ensure that the provision for and receipt of rolled up interest are treated consistently.
We have clarified the definition of cash profit and applied this to all years for which the Annual Award Pool has been in operation.
The cumulative spend as a percentage of profit to date is 20.6%.
As discussed in the policy table, a Managing Directors annual incentive award is governed by the size of the Annual Award Pool in addition to their individual performance as determined by the annual appraisal process.
At the beginning of the financial year under review, the Company assigned each Managing Director a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs broadly in the areas of fundraising and growth, investment portfolios, operational and risk management measures, people and performance management and financial performance.
The Board considers that the precise content of each of the Managing Directors KPIs is commercially sensitive because they would provide information to our competitors who, typically, are not required to disclose similar details, and so they are not disclosed in this report and will not be disclosed in the future.
Deferred Share Awards are made in respect of 50% of any annual bonus in excess of 100,000.
The vesting of these awards is subject to a continued service condition.
Payments from shadow carry arrangements were made to certain Managing Directors during the year which are included in the single total figure of remuneration on page 73.
The hurdle rate of return 8% in respect of the relevant vintage s has been met.
The split between variable elements of pay from the Annual Award Pool for the Managing Directors in 2013 14 was as follows: Elements of variable pay % PLC Equity 64 Balance Sheet Carry 14 Annual Cash Bonus 12 Deferred Share Award 10
