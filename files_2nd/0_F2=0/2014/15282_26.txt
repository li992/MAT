100 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 Notes to the Company financial statements 31 December 2014 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statement.
The cash flows of the Company are included in the Synthomer plc group financial statements.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and comply with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset plus the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Revaluation of properties Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
On the disposal or recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Intercompany Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right of set off exists.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Company financial statements Synthomer plc Annual Report 2014 101 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments are recognised on the Company balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade creditors Trade creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the profit and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the profit and loss account.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding In accordance with FRS 17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the defined benefit scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not an employer making the pension payments.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
