Directors Remuneration Report Continued Annual bonus for 2014 15 For the 2014 15 financial year, an element of the annual bonus 20% of basic salary will be assessed against strategic measures to better align our reward structure with key strategic priorities and to encourage behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business.
The remainder of the annual bonus will continue to be assessed against Group profit before tax.
Performance targets will continue to be set at the challenging levels of previous years.
50% of the annual bonus will be earned for on-target performance.
The actual performance targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive at this time.
The targets will be disclosed in next years Directors Remuneration Report or at such point that the Remuneration Committee considers that the performance targets are no longer commercially sensitive.
No changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity which will remain at 100% of salary.
Long term incentives audited information Awards vesting in respect of the financial period LTIP awards granted in April 2011 were subject to the achievement of an average EPS growth performance condition over a three year period ending 26 January 2014.
Awards vest if the average EPS for the three years running up to and including the year of calculation exceeds the average EPS of the three years preceding that period, both being adjusted for Retail Price Index RPI, by 10% or more.
EPS is calculated on the basis of profit before tax, adjusted to exclude exceptional items and other significant non-recurring items as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
No part of an award vests if EPS growth is less than 10% above RPI over the three year period.
20% 99.9% of an award vests on a sliding scale where EPS growth exceeds RPI by 10% or more but by less than 32.5%.
100% of an award vests where EPS growth exceeds RPI by 32.5% or more.
The maximum value of any award of shares is 100% of basic salary.

Long term incentives 2014 15 The current LTIP the 2003 LTIP was approved by shareholders in May 2003 and expired in May 2013.
The Remuneration Committee took the opportunity to review the remuneration policy for the executive directors, including the LTIP.
After engagement with major shareholders, shareholder approval for a new LTIP the 2014 LTIP is being sought at the AGM.
The Remuneration Committee is keen to ensure that the 2014 LTIP uses appropriate measures consistent with the Companys strategic objectives, including the long term delivery of sustainable growth.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore concluded that EPS growth should continue to be used as the performance measure for the 2014 LTIP.
The detailed performance metrics proposed are as follows: Threshold vesting at 20% of Maximum vesting at 100% % linked to award the maximum award of the maximum award EPS growth 100% 10% 32.5% There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
EPS this is a key measure of the Companys profitability.
Awards would vest if the average EPS for the three years running up to and including the year of calculation exceeds the average EPS of the three years preceding that period, both being adjusted for CPI, by at least 10%.
EPS is calculated on the basis of profit after tax, adjusted to exclude exceptional items and other significant non-recurring items as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
No part of an award would vest if EPS growth is less than 10% above CPI over the three year period.
20%-99.9% of an award would vest on a sliding scale where EPS growth exceeds CPI by 10% or more but by less than 32.5%.
100% of an award would vest where EPS growth exceeds CPI by 32.5% or more.
The normal maximum annual award under the 2014 LTIP will be increased from 100% to 125% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a normal maximum annual award of 125% is appropriate given the level of stretch in the proposed targets.
The Remuneration Committee proposes that the current vesting schedule is maintained so that the amount that will vest at threshold is 20% of the maximum award.
The Remuneration Committee is also conscious that the 2003 LTIP rules did not reflect best practice in terms of governance and administration of incentive awards.
The 2014 LTIP therefore includes updated provisions to reflect current best practice.
A summary of the key terms of the proposed 2014 LTIP rules is set out in the Notice of the AGM.
