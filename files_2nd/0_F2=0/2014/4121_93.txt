Impairment During the prior year the Board took the decision to demolish its mothballed production facility in East Lancashire following considerable investment in increased capacity at other Group locations in preference to utilising these premises as previously planned.
The book value of the property, plant and equipment was 1,836,000.
The fair value, which relates solely to the land, was determined by an independent valuer as 50,000, giving rise to an impairment loss of 1,786,000.
A further 50,000 was accrued for demolition of the property giving a total income statement impairment charge of 1,836,000.
