78 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOlIDATED FINANCIAl STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 Trade and other receivables continued A TrADE rECEIvABlES: CrEDIT rISk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in Note 24.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 30-60 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience reflecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to specific receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.
On this basis, the ageing analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is as follows: Trade receivables past due by: Less than 30 60 60 90 More than Current 30 days days days 90 days Total m m m m m m Carrying value at 30 April 2014 28.9 116.3 52.9 17.0 22.4 237.5 Carrying value at 30 April 2013 22.5 104.0 44.4 12.5 17.4 200.8 In practice, Sunbelt operates on 30 day terms and considers receivables past due if they are unpaid after 30 days.

The key assumptions for these financial plans are those regarding revenue growth, margins and capital expenditure required to replace the rental fleet and support the growth forecast which management estimates based on past experience, market conditions and expectations for the future development of the market.
The projections consist of the 2014 15 budget, a further two years from the Groups business plan and a further seven years cash flows.
The valuation uses an annual growth rate to determine the cash flows beyond the three year business plan period of 2%, which does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets, and a terminal value reflective of market multiples.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is 11% 2013: 10.5%.
The impairment review is sensitive to a change in key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the annuity growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the recoverable amount of the Sunbelt CGU being reduced to the carrying value.
The A-Plant CGU has headroom of 65m at the reporting date.
No reasonably possible change in the annuity growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value but an increase in the discount rate from 11% by 2.5% would reduce the recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying value.
SUNBElT Sunbelts revenue is linked primarily to US non-residential construction spend.
Following its return to growth in 2012, it is expected to continue to grow during the business plan period.
Sunbelt has grown more rapidly than both non-residential construction and the broader rental market and this out-performance is expected to continue over the business plan period, although not necessarily to the same degree as over the last two financial years.
EBITDA margins are forecast to increase slightly from current levels as Sunbelt benefits from increased scale.
A-PlANT A-Plants revenue is linked primarily to UK non-residential construction spend.
This market is expected to return to growth in 2014 and grow during the business plan period.
A-Plant has grown over the last two years while non-residential construction has declined and we expect it to perform ahead of the market as it recovers.
EBITDA margins are forecast to increase slightly from current levels as A-Plant benefits from increased scale.

FIrST PrIOrITy SENIOr SECUrED CrEDIT FACIlITy At 30 April 2014, $2.0bn was committed by our senior lenders under the asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility ABL facility until August 2018 while the amount utilised was $1,084m including letters of credit totalling $35m.
The ABL facility is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolving credit facility is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 175bp to LIBOR plus 225bp.
At 30 April 2014 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 175bp.
There are two financial performance covenants under the asset-based first priority senior bank facility: funded debt to LTM last twelve months EBITDA before exceptional items not to exceed 4.0 times: and a fixed charge ratio comprising LTM EBITDA before exceptional items less LTM net capital expenditure paid in cash over the sum of scheduled debt repayments plus cash interest, cash tax payments and dividends paid in the last 12 months which must be equal to or greater than 1.0 times.
These covenants do not, however, apply when excess availability the difference between the borrowing base and facility utilisation exceeds $200m.
At 30 April 2014 availability under the bank facility was $916m $667m at 30 April 2013, with an additional $770m of suppressed availability meaning that covenants were not measured at 30 April 2014 and are unlikely to be measured in forthcoming quarters.
As a matter of good practice, we calculate the covenant ratios each quarter.
At 30 April 2014, as a result of the continued significant investment in our rental fleet, the fixed charge ratio, as expected, did not meet the covenant requirement whilst the leverage ratio did so comfortably.
The fact the fixed charge ratio is below 1.0 times does not cause concern given the strong availability and managements ability to flex capital expenditure downwards at short notice.
Accordingly, the accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.
6.5% SECOND PrIOrITy SENIOr SECUrED NOTES DUE 2022 HAvING A NOMINAl vAlUE OF $900M On 16 July 2012 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Capital, Inc. issued $500m of 6.5% second priority senior secured notes due 15 July 2022.
On 12 December 2013, the Group issued an additional $400m of 6.5% second priority secured notes.
These notes were issued as an add-on to the 6.5% notes due 25 July 2022 indenture and, as such, were consolidated to form a single series of notes.
The notes are secured by second priority interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Under the terms of the 6.5% notes the Group is, subject to important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with another company.
Financial performance covenants under the 6.5% senior secured note issue are only measured at the time new debt is raised.

84 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOlIDATED FINANCIAl STATEMENTS CONTINUED 21 Share-based payments The Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT facilitates the provision of shares under the Groups Performance Share Plan PSP.
It holds a beneficial interest in 2,103,554 ordinary shares of the Company acquired at an average cost of 562.5p per share.
The shares had a market value of 18.4m at 30 April 2014.
The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not significant.
Details of the PSP are given on pages 49 and 54.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2014, there was a net charge to pre-tax profit in respect of the PSP of 3.4m 2013: 2.7m.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 2.3m 2013: 1.9m.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 664.5p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 1.13%, volatility of 42.2%, a risk-free rate of 0.73% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.
Details of the PSP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 2014 2013 Number Number Outstanding at 1 May 7,813,619 12,262,736 Granted 767,562 1,395,975 Exercised 4,044,350 5,709,095 Expired 63,446 135,997 Outstanding at 30 April 4,473,385 7,813,619 Exercisable at 30 April 22 Operating leases Minimum annual commitments under existing operating leases may be analysed by date of expiry of the lease as follows: 2014 2013 m m Land and buildings: Expiring in one year 4.8 4.1 Expiring between two and five years 18.5 18.7 Expiring in more than five years 12.7 12.8 36.0 35.6 Total minimum commitments under existing operating leases at 30 April 2014 through to the earliest date at which the lease may be exited without penalty by year are as follows: m Financial year 2015 36.0 2016 29.5 2017 26.0 2018 21.5 2019 16.5 Thereafter 43.1 172.6 5.1m of the total minimum operating lease commitments of 172.6m relating to vacant properties has been provided within the financial statements and included within provisions in the balance sheet.
Financial statements Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 85 23 Pensions DEFINED CONTrIBUTION PlANS The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.
The plans for new employees throughout the Group are all defined contribution plans.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were 6.3m 2013: 5.4m.
DEFINED BENEFIT PlAN The Group also has a defined benefit plan for certain UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
The plan is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
The Trustees are composed of representatives of both the Company and plan members.
The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy of the assets and the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
The plan is a final salary plan which provides members a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided by the plan depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
The plans duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the plan as whole, the duration is around 20 years.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid by the Company to the plan during the 2014 15 financial year is 0.8m.
The plan exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant being investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and life expectancy risk.
The most recent actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2013 by a qualified independent actuary and showed a funding surplus of 4.8m.
The actuary was engaged by the Company to perform a valuation in accordance with IAS 19 revised as at 30 April 2014.
The principal financial assumptions made by the actuary were as follows: 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.3% 4.2% Inflation assumption RPI 3.5% 3.4% CPI 2.5% 2.4% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.4% 3.3% Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 30 April 2014 update is based on the S1P CMI 2013 projection model mortality tables adjusted so as to apply a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.25% a year.
Samples of the ages to which pensioners are assumed to live are as follows: 2014 2013 Life expectancy of pensioners currently aged 65 Male 86.8 87.0 Female 89.0 89.3 Life expectancy at age 65 for future pensioner currently aged 45 Male 88.5 88.4 Female 90.9 90.9 The plans assets are invested in the following asset classes: Fair value 2014 2013 m m UK equities 43.2 38.6 US equities 9.6 8.1 European equities 2.3 1.9 Asia Pacific excluding Japan equities 3.8 3.6 Corporate bonds 9.8 16.4 Global loan fund 10.3 8.7 Property 5.1 Cash 0.3 0.2 84.4 77.5 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2014 2013 m m Fair value of plan assets 84.4 77.5 Present value of funded defined benefit obligation 78.3 77.0 Present value of unfunded defined benefit obligation 0.1 Net asset recognised in the balance sheet 6.1 0.4 86 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOlIDATED FINANCIAl STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Pensions continued The components of the defined benefit cost recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2013 2014 m m restated Current service cost 0.7 0.6 Administration expense 0.2 0.3 Net interest on the net defined benefit plan 0.2 Net charge to the income statement 0.9 0.7 The remeasurements of the defined benefit plan recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2014 2013 m m Actuarial gain loss due to changes in financial assumptions 0.3 10.6 Actuarial loss due to changes in demographic assumptions 0.3 0.1 Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments 0.7 0.6 Return on plan assets in excess of that recognised in net interest 4.6 7.5 Remeasurement of the defined benefit pension plan 5.3 3.8 Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2013 2014 m m restated At 1 May 77.1 63.7 Current service cost 0.7 0.6 Interest cost 3.2 3.0 National Insurance rebates received 0.1 Contributions from members 0.2 0.3 Remeasurements Actuarial gain loss due to changes in financial assumptions 0.3 10.6 Actuarial loss due to changes in demographic assumptions 0.3 0.1 Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments 0.7 0.6 Benefits paid 2.2 1.9 At 30 April 78.3 77.1 The key assumptions used in valuing the defined benefit obligation are: discount rate, inflation and mortality.
The sensitivity of the results to these assumptions is as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would result in a 7m 2013: 7m decrease in the defined benefit obligation.
An increase in the inflation rate of 0.5% would result in a 5m 2013: 6m increase in the defined benefit obligation.
This includes the resulting change to other assumptions that are related to inflation such as pensions and salary growth.
A one-year increase in the pensioner life expectancy at age 65 would result in a 3m 2013: 3m increase in the defined benefit obligation.
The above sensitivity analyses have been determined based on reasonably possible changes to the significant assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
The sensitivity information shown above has been prepared using the same method as adopted when adjusting the results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.
This is the same approach as has been adopted in previous periods.

Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports and pays dividends in pounds sterling.
MArkET rISk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas, the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of fixed and variable rate debt The Group has fixed and variable rate debt in issue with 47% of the drawn debt at a fixed rate as at 30 April 2014.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds plus 175bp.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2014, the Group had no such swap agreements outstanding.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2014, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax profits would change by approximately 6m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 4m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.
Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, the majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its financing such that, at 30 April 2014, 94% of its debt was denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
At 30 April 2014, dollar-denominated debt represented approximately 66% of the value of dollar-denominated net assets other than debt.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenue in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas profits into sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2014, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax profits by approximately 3m and equity by approximately 8m.
At 30 April 2014, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
CrEDIT rISk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 2014 2013 m m Cash and cash equivalents 2.8 20.3 Trade and other receivables 259.8 218.6 262.6 238.9 The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving almost 500,000 during the financial year, and does not have any significant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage it more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
88 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 NOTES TO THE CONSOlIDATED FINANCIAl STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 Financial risk management continued lIqUIDITy rISk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates significant free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash flow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2014, excess availability under the $2.0bn facility was $916m 667m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
The undiscounted cash flows have been calculated using foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates ruling at the balance sheet date.

The embedded prepayment options included within the new $900m secured loan notes are closely related to the host debt contract and hence, are not accounted for separately.
The loan notes are carried at amortised cost.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2014.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
