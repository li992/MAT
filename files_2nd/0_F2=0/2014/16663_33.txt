Shareholders funds 8.1 Accounting policy Taxation Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balancesheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.

Share-based payments 9.1 Accounting policy The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
9.2 Profit and loss account recognition The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed between pages 75 to 93 of the Directors remuneration report.
1.3m was charged to the profit and loss account in the year with regard to share-based payments 2013: 0.9m.
9.3 Details of outstanding options The information in the tables below has been restated to take into account the demerger of the Alent business from the Cookson Group.

10. contingent liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2014 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 457.7m 2013: 467.7m, which includes guarantees of $310m and 30m 2013: $310m and 30m in respect of US Private Placement Loan Notes and 81.5m 2013: 96.4m in respect of drawings under the syndicated bank facility: together with 108.2m 2013: 108.2m inrelation to a guarantee provided to the Companys UK subsidiary which acts as Trustee for the Groups UK pension plan.
The guarantee is over all present and future pension liabilities of the plan and the contingent liability amount represents the net deficit on a solvency valuation basis as shown in the most recent triennial valuation.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, thesubject of dispute with tax authorities.
While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition orresults of operations.
Related parties All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this Note.
