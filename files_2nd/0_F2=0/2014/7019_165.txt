Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition are included and accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
During the financial year ended 29 March 2014 adjustments were made to the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities included in the provisional accounting for the following prior year acquisitions: a MicroSurgical Technology, Inc. : b Thinketron Precision Equipment Company Limited and its main trading subsidiary, Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co. Ltd : and c ASL Holdings Limited.
The provisional accounting was updated for non-material changes to certain provisions, inventory valuations and deferred tax balances.
The combined adjustments made for each acquisition resulted in a net adjustment to goodwill of 617,000.
All adjustments to the provisional accounting were made within the goodwill measurement period, relevant to each acquisition, as defined by IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the accounting for all current and prior year acquisitions is completed.
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired shown above approximates to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 revised.
None of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Talentum, the one acquisition in the year, contributed 2,132,000 of revenue and 576,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 29 March 2014.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 52,000 and 13,000 higher respectively.
