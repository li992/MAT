The appointment of trustees is determined by the trust documentation.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by the trustees of the scheme or on behalf of the Board in the case of the local government pension schemes to meet long-term pension liabilities to beneficiaries.
The trustees or boards as appropriate of the schemes invest the assets in line with the Statement of Investment Principles.
The Statement of Investment Principles has been established after taking into consideration the liabilities of the schemes and the investment risk that the trustees or boards as appropriate are willing to accept for those schemes governed by trustees the Group will have been consulted before the Statement of Investment Principles was formally adopted.
