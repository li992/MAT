There were no unchanged with 2013. changes to the Limpopo Reserves.
Revisions to the South African Mineral Resource The attributable total Mineral Reserves for estimates were confined to the Marikana and Marikana were 35.5 million ounces of 3PGE Au Pandora properties.
The Mineral Resources at in 2014.
Marikana excluding tailings were unchanged in The Proved Mineral Reserves increased by 2014.
This is attributed to the nett effect of an 0.1 million ounces 3PGE Au in 2014.
This is increase in the Merensky Mineral Resources the net effect of depletion 0.5 million ounces being offset by a decrease of the UG2 Mineral offset by the conversion of Probable to Proved Resources.
The Merensky Measured and Mineral Reserve.
Indicated Mineral Resources increased by 0.8 million ounces whereas Inferred Mineral No changes occurred with respect to the Resources increased by 0.2 million ounces due operating shaft boundaries at Marikana during to re-evaluation after depletion.
The decrease in the period.
UG2 Mineral Resources of 1.0 million ounces is There were no fundamental changes in the the result of mining depletion 0.6 million ounces Lonmin life of business plan from the 2013 and loss on evaluation 0.4 million ounces.
Considering the disruptions The Pandora Mineral Resource decreased by experienced during 2014, the original 2013 2014 20,000 of 3PGE Au, the net result of mining LTP plan was applied for the purposes of depletion partially offset by reduced geological quantifying the Mineral Reserves for 2014. losses.
Attributable 3PGE Au in Mineral Reserve Moz The Marikana Tailings, Akanani, Limpopo and Loskop Mineral Resources were unchanged Marikana 35.5 during 2014.
Akanani The Mineral Resources for the Denison Limpopo 4.4 109 Deposit in Canada have been reported Pandora JV 0.8 unchanged.
Limpopo Baobab Shaft 1.0 Revisions to the non-South African Mineral Loskop JV Resources have been reported for the Bumbo Tailings Dams 0.7 base metal and gold deposit in Kenya.
Changes Sudbury PGM JV to the Mineral Resource classification was made 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 by converting 28,000 tonnes of Cu-equivalent metal from Inferred to Indicated confidence.
All figures are reported on a Lonmin Plc attributable basis, the relative proportions of ownership are per project.
Loskop and Sudbury PGM JV exclude Rh, due to insufficient assays, and therefore 2PGE Au are reported.
Tailings Dam exclude Au, due to assay values below laboratory detection limit, and therefore are reported as 3PGE.
Resources are reported Inclusive of Reserves.
