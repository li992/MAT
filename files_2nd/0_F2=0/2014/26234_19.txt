STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 105 Independent auditors report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc Report on the group financial statements Our opinion In our opinion, Legal & General Group Plcs group financial statements the financial statements : give a true and fair view of the state of the groups affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended: have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited Legal & General Group Plcs financial statements comprise: the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2014: the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended: the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended: the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended: and the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach Overview Overall group materiality: 70 million which represents 5.5% of Operating profit before tax.
Of the Groups 84 reporting units, we identified 30 that, in our view, required an audit of their Materiality complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics.
Specific audit procedures on specific balances and transactions were performed at a further 8 reporting units.
These reporting units represent 87% of total assets, 87% of Operating profit before tax and 85% of Audit scope IFRS profit after tax.
We concluded that this, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.

focus Valuation of participating and non-participating insurance liabilities protection.
Valuation of complex financial investments and investment property.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table below.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditors report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc continued Report on the group financial statements continued Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Valuation of non-participating insurance liabilities retirement We focused on this area because the non-participating insurance liabilities for retirement products are significant in size and their estimation is inherently judgemental.
The valuation of non-participating insurance liabilities for retirement is sensitive to: Valuation interest rate the discount rate derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liability used in calculating the present value of annuity and benefit payments.
The discount rate also includes an explicit allowance for future default and reinvestment risk on the asset portfolio: and Longevity how long the policyholders receiving annuity payments are expected to live and how that might change over time.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and Note 1 to the group financial statements for the Directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and Notes 20, 21 and 22 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates.

to calculate the internal rate of return IRR.
We tested the mathematical accuracy of the IRR calculations.
On a sample basis, we tested the credit ratings used to estimate the long term default allowance back to independent third party credit rating sources.
Where internally generated ratings were used, we assessed the rating model and the methodology using specialist treasury expertise and tested the inputs to third party data.
We did not identify any significant exceptions in this testing.
Our work involved understanding the degree of rigour, challenge and oversight provided by Management and the Directors in relation to the setting of the credit default assumptions and the methodology used to model the cash flows.
Using our actuarial specialist team members, we obtained and challenged technical papers that set out the relevant factors being taken into account by Management when making judgements on setting the credit default assumptions and changes to the valuation interest rate methodology.
Based on the work undertaken, we found the valuation interest rate used to be appropriate.
Longevity assumptions We evaluated the design and implementation as well as tested the operating effectiveness of The estimates of the period over which an amount controls over accuracy and completeness of the data used in the experience analysis.

We found that the methodologies and models used are in line with the prior year and industry standards, whilst reflecting the nature of the groups Retirement business.
Valuation of participating and non-participating insurance liabilities protection We focused on this area because the participating and non-participating insurance liabilities for protection products in the UK are significant in size and their estimation is inherently judgemental.
The valuation of insurance liabilities for protection is sensitive to: persistency the rate at which policies are retained over time and therefore continue to contribute premium income: and mortality and morbidity the rate at which policyholders die or suffer critical illness.
Persistency assumptions Using our actuarial expertise, we assessed the results of the experience analysis carried out The rate at which policyholders cease protection by the group for the protection business to determine whether they provided support for the products is projected using the groups historical assumptions used.
In undertaking our assessment we took account of the potential for future experience and assumptions experience analysis changes in experience arising from regulatory changes, including the Retail Distribution about future changes to policyholder behaviour.

We also agreed data back to policy documentation and claims history.
We compared the Directors persistency assumptions with those adopted by other insurers using our own independent industry benchmarking survey.
Persistency assumptions are inherently subjective, particularly in light of recent regulatory changes.
However, we found that the assumptions used were reasonable in the context of the groups products.

We found that the methodologies and models used are in line with the prior year and industry standards, whilst reflecting the nature of the groups protection business.
Valuation of complex financial investments and investment property The groups financial and property investments enable it to support its insurance liabilities and meet regulatory capital requirements, as well as providing returns on shareholder assets the assets available for distribution to shareholders after taking account of policyholder liabilities, including associated guarantees, options and bonuses.
Most of the groups financial investments are valued by reference to prices on active markets.
However, some are priced by reference to market data and or valuation models.
They vary in complexity depending on the nature of the investments.
Investments that are complex to value and require the use of significant judgement include: commercial loans: collateralised debt obligations CDOs : and over-the-counter OTC derivatives.
The groups property portfolio is significant and involves a number of complex investment transactions including social housing projects, sale-andleaseback transactions and asset based loans.
Due to the size of the groups property portfolio and the judgement involved in property valuations, the likelihood of misstatements is heightened.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report and Note 1 to the group financial statements for the Directors disclosures of the basis of preparation and use of estimates and Note 13 for related accounting policies and further information on judgements and estimates for investment risks.
Commercial loans, CDOs and OTC derivatives We assessed the investment valuation processes and tested controls in place over the We focused on the valuation of commercial loans, valuation of all investments.

For CDO investments, we: obtained independent confirmation from the counterparties for all outstanding positions and associated collateral: re-priced the collateral to independent external third party sources: read the report from and met with the Directors external valuation expert to understand their objectivity, qualifications, approach, and their findings: and compared the internal price, the counterparty price and Directors experts price and investigated differences over a tolerance based on the component materiality.
We did not identify any material exceptions in our testing of the confirmations, the collateral, or the comparison of different estimates of the prices.
We checked that the disclosures of the complex investments were compliant with IFRSs, and found that they were.

valuations adopted to be appropriate for the groups investment properties.
We agreed the valuations recognised to the Directors external valuation experts reports.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
The group is reported in five reportable segments: Legal & General Assurance Society LGAS, Legal & General Retirement LGR, Legal & General Investment Management LGIM, Legal & General America LGA and Legal & General Capital LGC.
These segments are disaggregated into reporting units.
The groups financial statements are a consolidation of these reporting units.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed on reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or component audit teams within PwC UK, from other PwC network firms and non PwC firms operating under our instructions.
Of the groups 84 reporting units, we identified 30 that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or risk.
Specific audit procedures on specific balances and transactions were performed on a further 8 reporting units.
Additional procedures were performed at a group level over expenses.
This gave us 87% coverage over total assets, 87% of Operating profit before tax, and 85% of IFRS profit after tax.
We concluded that this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Overall group materiality 70 million 2013: 70 million.
How we determined it Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole of 70 million which represents 5.5% of Operating profit before tax 2013: 7.5%.
Rationale for benchmark applied We concluded that Operating profit before tax was the most relevant benchmark because it reflects the underlying profit of the business.
While this is not an IFRS measure of profit, it is reconciled to IFRS profit before tax in the financial statements and is one of the key metrics used by the group in running its business.
Whilst overall materiality was assessed with reference to Operating profit before tax, we compared our materiality level against other relevant benchmarks, such as total assets, total revenue and IFRS profit before tax in order to ensure the materiality benchmark selected was appropriate for our audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 3.5 million 2013: 3.5 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors statement in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 109 As noted in the Directors statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting.
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 110 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent auditors report to the members of Legal & General Group Plc continued Report on the group financial statements continued What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation Legal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom UK, together with its subsidiaries, transacts life assurance and long-term savings business, fund management and most classes of general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries and associates in the UK, the United States and other countries throughout the world.
Significant accounting policies The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The group financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB as adopted by the EU.
The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
The group presents its balance sheet in order of liquidity.
This is considered to be more relevant than a before and after 12 months presentation, given the long term nature of the groups core business.
However, for each asset and liability line item which combines amounts expected to be recovered or settled before and after 12 months from the balance sheet date, disclosure of the split is made by way of a note.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the balance sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the income statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 or later periods but which the group has not adopted early.
Details of these are contained within Note 13 Financial investments and Investment property and Note 23 Investment contract liabilities.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
This is particularly relevant for the determination of fair values of investment property Note 13 and unquoted and illiquid financial investments Note 13 iv : the estimation of deferred acquisition costs Note 11 : tax balances Note 36 : and the estimation of insurance and investment contract liabilities Notes 22 and 23.
The basis of accounting for these areas, and the significant judgements used in determining them, are outlined in the respective notes to the financial statements.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 119 PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee Note 47.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders Note 13 v in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures The group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 48 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity partnerships, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the groups share of the profit or loss after the date of the acquisition.
Product classification The groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 22 and 23 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these consolidated financial statements.
Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
The year end exchange rates at 31 December 2014 were 1.56 United States Dollar and 1.29 Euro at 31 December 2013: 1.66 United States Dollar and 1.20 Euro.
The average exchange rates for year ended 31 December 2014 were 1.65 United States Dollar and 1.24 Euro year ended 31 December 2013: 1.57 United States Dollar and 1.18 Euro.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 120 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIMARY STATEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 1 Basis of preparation continued Changes to accounting policy IASB consolidation project On 1 January 2014 the application of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities became compulsory for entities reporting in the EU.
IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements defines the principle of control and establishes control as the basis for determining which entities are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements.
This states that an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The application of IFRS 10 has resulted in the group consolidating a small number of investment vehicles which were not previously consolidated.
There is no material impact on the profit reported for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The effect on profit, total equity and cash flow previously reported at 31 December 2013 is shown below.
A statement of consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2012 has not been presented as the effect is not material.
The prior period information in the following Notes 13, 15, 16, 26, 28, 33 and 42 has been restated to reflect the adoption by the group of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements defines and establishes accounting principles for joint arrangements.
Based on how rights and obligations are shared by parties to the arrangements, it distinguishes between two such types: joint ventures and joint operations.
As all of our joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures the adoption of this Standard has no impact upon the group.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities, and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
As a result we have enhanced the disclosures we provide around our interests in subsidiaries Note 47, associates and joint ventures Note 48, together with providing additional information on structured entities Note 49 which we do not consolidate.

G ains on non-controlling interests have been restated to reflect the adoption by the group of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements.
The impact is to increase gains on non-controlling interests and profit for the year by 10m for 2013.
The profit attributable to equity holders remains unaffected.
Group debt costs exclude interest on non recourse financing.
Group Investment projects and expenses in 2014 include restructuring costs of 31m.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the groups key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and the group believes gives shareholders a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year.
During the year the group redefined its operating profit definition, and applied this prospectively.
Under the new definition, restructuring costs, while varying from year to year, are considered to be part of ongoing business activities and as such, are included within operating profit.
Operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items.
Operating profit therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the groups insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGA which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed assumptions are reported below operating profit.
Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition, start-up and closure costs, are excluded from operating profit.
LGAS represents Insurance business retail protection, group protection and general insurance and Savings business platforms, workplace, SIPPs, mature savings and with-profits.
The LGAS segment also includes Legal & General France LGF, Legal & General Netherlands LGN and emerging markets.
LGR represents Annuities both individual and bulk purchase and longevity insurance.
The LGIM segment represents institutional and retail investment management businesses.
LGC represents the medium term investment return less expenses on group invested assets, using assumptions applied to the average balance of group invested assets including interest bearing intra-group balances calculated on a monthly basis.
The LGA segment comprises protection business written in the USA.

The LGAS operational cash generation also includes the shareholders share of bonuses on with-profits business, dividends remitted from LGF and LGN and operating profit after tax from General Insurance and the remaining Savings businesses.
New business strain for LGAS and LGR represents the cost of acquiring new business and setting up regulatory reserves in respect of the new business for UK non profit Insurance, Savings and Annuities, net of tax.
The new business strain and operational cash generation for both LGAS and LGR exclude required solvency margin from the liability calculation.
Net cash generation for LGAS and LGR is defined as operational cash generation less new business strain.
Operational cash generation and net cash for LGIM and LGC represents the operating profit net of tax.
The operational cash generation for LGA represents the dividends received.
See Note 2 iii for more detail on experience variances, assumption changes and non-cash items.

The mortality morbidity experience variances in LGAS in 2014 primarily relates to adverse morbidity on one of our group protection products.
The persistency valuation assumption change in LGAS primarily relates to an improvement in the experience and modelling for persistency on some of our long term products.
The mortality morbidity valuation assumption change in LGAS primarily relates to an improvement in the modelling for certain morbidity features on our retail protection products.
The LGR mortality valuation assumption change primarily relates to the adoption of the recent CMI projection table CMI2013 with an allowance for anticipated changes that have been incorporated into the CMI2014 model.
T he other valuation assumption change in LGAS primarily relates to a refinement in the modelling for reinsurance on certain long term policies.
The DAC in LGAS represents the amortisation charges offset by new acquisition costs deferred in the year.
The DIL reflects initial fees on insured savings business which relate to the future provision of services and are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which these services are provided.
T he other non-cash items in LGR primarily relates to the elimination of intra-group future profits arising from the provision of investment management services at market referenced rates.

The impact is to increase the profit for the period by 10m for 2013.
The equity holders effective tax rate for the year is 19.9% 2013: 20.8%.
The groups effective tax rate remains slightly below the UK corporation tax rate due to differences between the measurement of accounting and taxable profits.
3 Other operational income and expense Operational income comprises fee income from estate agency operations, agency fee income relating to distribution services, and revenue of 628m 2013: 600m from consolidated private equity investments.
Operational income is accounted for on an accruals basis.

The dividend per share calculation is based on the number of equity shares registered on the ex-dividend date.
The dividend proposed is not included as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
5 Earnings per share Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT 7 Principal Products A significant part of the groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
A description of the principal products offered by the groups segments is outlined below.
The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.
The groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 48-55.
Details of the risks associated with the groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 8 and 19.
LGAS LGAS business comprises retail and group protection, general insurance products, the businesses in France and Netherlands and savings products.
Protection business retail and group The group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits: these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benefits cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.
General insurance The group offers Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU products: Household contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
In addition, there are portfolios of Motor Insurance and Domestic Mortgage Indemnity Insurance DMI in run off.
Since 1993, the DMI contract has included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed.
The group also sells pet insurance products.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 129 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Legal & General France LGF and Legal & General Netherlands LGN In addition to protection products, LGF and LGN also write savings business.
In LGF this includes unit linked savings, including shares of open ended investment vehicles SICAVS, risks for which are borne by unit holders of these funds, Euro denominated funds with a 100% profit sharing clause and bank based investment accounts.
In LGN this includes unit linked and index linked savings products, bank based investment accounts and corporate pension products.
Certain savings products include an exposure to interest rate and credit risk, managed through an active asset-liability management programme.
Savings A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benefits within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benefits.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts and with-profits bonds: and Unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products.
For unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written in the LGAS LTF long term fund.
Collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benefits.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
Participating contracts Discretionary increases to benefits on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the groups Principles Practices of Financial Management PPFM for the management of the with-profits part of the LGAS LTF.
The principles include: The with-profits part of the LGAS LTF will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: With-profits policies have no expectation of any distribution from the with-profits part of the LGAS LTFs inherited estate.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the LGAS LTF over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benefits: Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term fluctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits part of the LGAS LTF are not immediately reflected in payments under with-profits policies: and Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 130 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 7 Principal Products continued LGAS continued Participating contracts continued At 30 June 2005 an assessment was made of the expected cost of guarantees and options to be paid in the future, and funds with the same value to meet these costs were allocated from the capital in the with-profits sub-fund.
The value of the funds is regularly assessed and is reduced by the cost of guarantees and options paid since 1 July 2005.
At each assessment point, if the value of the funds is lower than the expected cost of guarantees and options, it is possible to make deductions from or refunds to asset shares to cover the difference.
It is intended to limit deductions to no more than 0.75% each year, up to a maximum of 5% per policy.
In 2013 the timing of the deduction refund was changed to be based on the period ending 30 September to ensure that in future the deduction refund could be included in the forthcoming bonus declarations rather than delaying for a year.
Following the movement in the expected cost of guarantees and options and the value of the associated funds up to 30 September 2014, and in accordance with the Societys PPFM, a refund of 0.55% was made to asset shares.
This followed a zero deduction in respect of the period from 31 December 2012 to 30 September 2013.
The refund of 0.55% to asset shares has returned all outstanding past charges to policyholders.
In addition, a charge of 1.25% would be levied on all unitised with-profits policies in the February 2015 bonus investigation to adjust their asset shares in respect of unrecovered expenses on future claims so that fairness between different groups of with-profits policies can be maintained.
The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the year.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
Business which is written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF is managed to be self-supporting.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the with-profits part of the Society LTF to meet its liabilities, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 Society LTF restructure, the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 150m at the end of 2014 and will then gradually reduce to zero at the end of 2017.
LGR Annuity contracts Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2014 was 524m 2013: 311m.
Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 5m 2013: 3m.
Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
The group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 196m 2013: 140m.
Longevity insurance contracts The group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return.
Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.

LGC Investment Strategy and Implementation Shareholder assets, which are managed by LGC, include portfolios of equity, property, bond and other direct investments, not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
The value of, and income from, these assets is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy.
Potential volatility in returns are managed using a range of techniques, including performance benchmarks, foreign exchange hedging and limits on investment variance and, concentrations of exposures by asset type and geographic region.
Direct Investments and Structuring Direct Investments are becoming an increasingly important part of our growth strategy.
We define Direct Investments as one off investments made with another counterparty, for example: a loan made directly to a UK SME: a property purchased and held or an equity stake in a private company.
We invest in Direct Investments for a number of reasons including when they offer better risk adjusted returns: give diversity to our traded market instruments, and where synergies arise with other parts of our business.
All with the aim of increasing shareholder returns.
We currently have a sector focus on Housing, Urban Regeneration, Energy and Alternate Financing for investments made in LGC.
LGA Protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 132 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 7 Principal Products continued LGA continued Protection business continued Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the groups balance sheet.
Within LGA, reinsurance and securitisation is also used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation governing term insurance and universal life reserves.
Universal life Universal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $653m 419m at 31 December 2014 $666m 402m at 31 December 2013.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2013: 3% to 4%.
Annuities Immediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGR.
Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.
The reserves for immediate annuities and deferred annuities totalled $10m 6m and $194m 124m, respectively, at 31 December 2014 $11m 7m and $193m 117m at 31 December 2013, respectively.
8 Asset risk The group is exposed to the following categories of risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 7.
Market risk Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.
Credit risk Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.
Liquidity risk The risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
The financial risks associated with LGIMs businesses are directly borne by the investors in its funds.
Therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented.
The approach to the management of operational risks, including loss arising from trading errors, breach of fund management guidelines or valuation errors, where a breakdown in controls could lead to successful litigation against the company by one or more clients, is set out in Note 29.
The principal risks and associated controls relevant to our businesses are consistent with those identified for our UK businesses and therefore have not been repeated here.
The group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board.

9 Assets analysis The group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
The four categorisations presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both the Society Long term fund LTF and in the LTF of Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The group is, therefore, not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the Society LTF and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
With-profits also includes participating business in the LGF operation which shares similar characteristics.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held within UK LTFs, which comprise of Annuities, Protection and Non profit savings products in UK business.
Shareholder All other assets are classified as shareholder assets.
Shareholders of the group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets.
This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations and general insurance.

The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts.
These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Intangible assets acquired via business combinations, such as the value of customer relationships, are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised over their useful life in line with the expected emergence of profit from the business.
Where software costs are separately identifiable and measurable they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life.
Purchased interest in long term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows: Long term insurance business Acquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits part of the UK Long Term Funds LTFs which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins.
For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
General insurance A proportion of commission and other acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums is carried forward as deferred acquisition costs or, in respect of reinsurance outwards, as deferred income.
Investment contracts For participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable from future revenue.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.

The group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The groups policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classified as AFS.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the groups investment strategy.
Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS under IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Assets backing participating and non-participating policyholder liabilities outside the US are designated as FVTPL.
For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The groups non-participating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments are based on bid prices, which management believe to be representative of fair value.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, consensus market pricing, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which represent current best practice, developed by the Association Franais des Investisseurs en Capital, the British Venture Capital Association and the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.
The techniques used for determining fair value include earnings multiples, the price of a recent investment or a net asset basis.
Financial investments classified as HFT and FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the income statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 140 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 13 Financial investments and Investment property continued Financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reflected in the income statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement within investment return.
Investment property in the UK is valued bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
Future developments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments issued in July 2014 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement.
The first is a principle-based model for classification and measurement of financial instruments driven by cash flow characteristics and the business model in which an asset is held, replacing existing requirements.
The second is a single expected loss impairment model that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses.
Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected credit losses from when financial instruments are first recognised, and it lowers the threshold for recognition of full lifetime expected losses.
Finally, IFRS 9 also introduces a substantially reformed model for hedge accounting with enhanced disclosures about risk management activities, enabling entities to better reflect these activities in their financial statements.
The publication of IFRS 9 now completes the IASBs project to replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The group does not intend to early adopt this Standard.

Investment risks on unit linked assets are borne by the policyholders.
The remaining risks associated with financial investments are outlined in Note 8.
Financial investments include 554m 2013: 313m of debt securities pledged as collateral against derivative liabilities.
The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA and AA Corporate Bonds and Cash 2013: Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA Supranational Bonds and AA Corporate Bonds having a residual maturity of over 41 years 2013: over 42 years.
The group is entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the asset during the period when it is pledged as collateral.
Further, there is no obligation to pay or transfer these cash flows to another entity.
The group can decide to substitute an asset which is designated as collateral at any time, provided the relevant terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association agreement are met.
Various bulk purchase annuity deals were undertaken throughout the year and 3,008m of Corporate Bonds and Treasury Gilts are pledged as collateral in relation to these.
Financial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected settlement of the backed liabilities.
Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be settled after 12 months.
Non profit non-unit linked debt securities includes 919m 2013: 568m of commercial loans designated as fair value through profit and loss.

A loss of 14m 2013: loss of 2m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the movement in fair value of these investments.
Property investments which are held via partnerships or unit trust vehicles are also included within equity securities.
A gain of 47m 2013: gain of 5m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the movement in fair value of these investments.
Included within unit linked equity securities are 315m 2013: 306m of debt instruments which incorporate an embedded derivative linked to the value of the groups share price.
ii Collateralised debt obligations CDOs The group holds CDOs with a market value of 1,215m at 31 December 2014 2013: 1,098m.
These holdings include 994m 2013: 983m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by Legal & General as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The group selected at outset and manages the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversified portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk although there have been no substitutions in 2013 or 2014.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: 2014 2013 Sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services and Goods 25 25 Financial Services 6 6 Technology and Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil and Gas 6 6 Health Care 4 4 100 100 The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 27.5%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, then over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 27.5% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 30.4% or if 43.5% of the names in the reference portfolio defaulted, with an average 30% recovery rate.
All figures are averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2013 or 2014.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependent on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs during 2014 2013: nil.
During 2014, the group received nil 2013: nil previously posted collateral.
The amount of the cash equivalent collateral attached to CDOs during the year is nil.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
The remaining balance of CDO holdings is 221m 2013: 115m.
Unit linked CDOs are excluded from the analysis as the risk is retained by the policyholders.

Other loans includes 188m 2013: 6m of commercial mortgage loans in 2014.
There are no material differences between the carrying values reflected above and the fair values of these loans.
Were these loans to be held at fair value they would fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
iv Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the groups level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as iBoxx, IDC and Bloomberg, which use mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, except for bespoke CDO and swaps holdings see below.
In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classified them as level 2.
The CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTRaxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classified in level 2.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2014 2013: nil.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 146 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 13 Financial investments and Investment property continued iv Fair value hierarchy continued a Assets measured at fair value based on level 3 Level 3 assets where internal models are used to represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed, comprise both property and unquoted equities, the latter including investments in private equity, property vehicles and suspended securities.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within level 3.
The group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgements regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could significantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 149 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 14 Derivative assets and liabilities The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: recognise in shareholders equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Any cumulative gains and or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation: defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the income statement, within other expenses, in the current year.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.

Actual trends in policy lapse rates are monitored with adverse trends being subject to actuarial investigation.
For insured contracts, terms and conditions typically include surrender deductions to mitigate the risk.
In later periods, once the acquisition costs have been recouped, the effect of lapses and surrenders depends upon the relationship between the exit benefit, if any, and the liability for that contract.

Reinsurance arrangements are used to further mitigate the risk.
Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
These correlations are difficult to estimate though they would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios became more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 164 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 20 Long term insurance valuation assumptions The groups insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the groups operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
i Non-participating business For its non-participating business the group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that used to determine the assumptions used for PRA statutory Peak 1, although the actual assumptions may sometimes differ from those used for regulatory reporting purposes.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2014, the group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and also maintained the level of the long term default allowance at 40bps per annum 2013: 40bps for unapproved securities backing non profit business and 35bps per annum 2013: 35bps for unapproved securities backing non participating with-profits business.
For approved securities and swaps backing the non profit annuity business, the allowance is 9bps per annum 2013: 9bps.
For approved securities and swaps backing non participating with-profit business the allowance decreased to 5bps per annum 2013: 5bps.
For unapproved securities backing non profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 54bps per annum 2013: 56bps when expressed over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 2.3bn 2013: 1.8bn.
The group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable, adjusted for the cost of default.
Default rates used in the calculations vary by tenant category.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, with an appropriate allowance for prudence.
These tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 165 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Expenses The group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the groups business plan.
An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
The expense assumptions also include an appropriate allowance for prudence.
Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
ii Participating business For its participating business, the group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out in FRS 27.
Non-economic assumptions Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the groups best estimates of future experience.
Economic assumptions The PRAs realistic reporting regime requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, and for property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased by ten basis points.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and inflation.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
Guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available at retirement.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 167 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Persistency assumptions Lapse rates assumptions are used in the PRA statutory Peak 1 valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of non profit business, as defined by the requirements of the annual returns to the PRA, is shown below.
The lapse rates for unit linked business represent the decrement from in-force to surrender and for 2013 combine experience for non profit and non-participating business.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 170 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 21 IFRS sensitivity analysis continued The table shows the impacts on group pre-tax profit and equity, net of reinsurance, under each sensitivity scenario for the group.
The participating funds have been excluded in the above sensitivity analysis as the impact of the sensitivities on IFRS profit and equity is offset by the movement in the unallocated divisible surplus UDS.
The shareholders share of with-profit bonus declared in the year is relatively insensitive to market movements due to the smoothing policies applied.
The above sensitivity analyses do not reflect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analyses also ignore any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged, though in practice, items of the groups experience may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
These results should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
The interest rate sensitivity assumes a 100 basis point change in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with a 100 basis point change in the real yields on variable securities.
For the UK long term funds, valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of PRA regulations.
The interest rate sensitivities reflect the impact of the regulatory restrictions on the reinvestment rate used to value the liabilities of the long term business.
Modelling improvements have been made in the year which more accurately isolate the impacts of discrete assumptions changes.
This, coupled with the increase in the groups annuity liabilities have led to an increase in the reported 2014 sensitivities for interest rates and inflation.
No yield floors have been applied in the estimation of the stresses, despite the current low interest rate environment.
Interest rate and inflation expectation have historically shown positive correlation and have therefore been presented next to each other.
The inflation stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in inflation resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense inflation rate is increased by 1% pa.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The equity stress is a 10% fall in listed equity market values.
The property stress adopted is a 10% fall in property market value.
Rental income is assumed to be unchanged: however the vacant possession value is stressed down by 10% in line with the market value stress.
Where property is being used to back liabilities, the valuation interest rate used to place a value on the liabilities moves with the implied change in property yields.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 1% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
The assurance mortality stress represents an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
The credit default stress assumes a -10bps stress to the current credit default assumption for unapproved corporate bonds which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities.
The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of the individual bonds in the asset portfolio and their outstanding term using Moodys global credit default rates.
For the sensitivity to the default of the groups largest external reinsurer, the reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to the external reinsurer and represents the impact of the default of largest external reinsurer at an entity level.
Details of IGD sensitivity analysis can be found in Table 2 of Note 30.
The group also uses embedded value financial statements information to manage risk.
The effect of alternative assumptions on the long term embedded value, prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in October 2005 are contained in Note 8 of the European Embedded Value section.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 171 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 22 Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract.
A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benefits as well as additional benefits: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the group: and which are contractually based on: the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or the profit or loss of the Company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK and most Garantie Long Terme contracts in France are classified as participating.
Long term insurance Death claims are accounted for on notification of death.
Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other long term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
The change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business.
The movement also reflects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous periods expectations.
Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
UK In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the long term funds LTFs in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs and contractually guaranteed benefits.
For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent with Legal & General Assurance Society Limiteds Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
The shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits PVFP for this business is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
Overseas The long term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reflect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 172 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 22 Insurance contract liabilities continued General insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be definitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but not yet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.
Liability adequacy tests The group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
Reinsurance The groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.

Insurance contract undiscounted cash flows are based on the expected date of settlement.
Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
Non-participating investment contracts are unit linked contracts.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the year less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014, is effective, subject to EU endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
This Standard provides clear guidance over when and how much revenue should be recognised.
It provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition, and introduces the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied.
As IFRS 15 has only recently been issued a full assessment is currently on going to determine the impact upon the group, focussing in particular on our investment management business.
The Standard does not apply to business classified as insurance contracts.

Accordingly unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the reported cash flows.
A maturity analysis based on the earliest contractual repayment date would present investment contract liabilities as due on the earliest period of the table because policyholders can exercise cancellation options at their discretion.
In such a scenario, the liability would be reduced due to the application of surrender penalties.

Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Borrowings comprise core borrowings such as subordinated bond issues and long term unsecured senior debt.
Operational borrowings include commercial paper issuance and bank borrowings under both committed and uncommitted debt facilities including bank overdrafts.
Borrowings secured on specific assets cash flows such as Triple X securitisations and private equity fund linked partnership assets are included as non recourse borrowings.
Mortgage loans raised by SIPP clients secured on those properties invested in their portfolio of linked SIPP investments which we manage on their behalf are treated as unit linked borrowings.

No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2014.
The maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If refinancing under the groups credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.
Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.
Short term assets available at the holding company level exceeded the amount of non-unit linked short term operational borrowings of 81m 2013: 177m.
Short term operational borrowings comprise Euro Commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts.

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 185 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long-term pension obligations to past and present employees.
Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries.
The Trustees long term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the ongoing operational costs of the schemes and to maximise returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.
The total number of members of the UK Fund and Scheme was: 2014 2013 537 637 Active 4,173 4,227 Deferred Pensioners 3,371 3,285 8,081 8,149 The group work closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long term objectives of the trustees as noted above.
Each UK scheme has a Statement of Investment Principles which governs the mix of assets and limits for each class of asset.
As noted below the asset mix of the schemes is primarily split between bonds and equities.
Additionally certain of the liabilities of the scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group.
These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes but at 31 December 2014 the value of these annuities, on an IAS19 basis, was 723m 2013: 646m.
The Scheme and Fund are primarily exposed to equity price risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk.
These risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Scheme and Fund and the sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.
Annuities are purchased to mitigate these risks for certain of the pension liabilities which passes the risks from the Scheme and Fund onto the group.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out on the Scheme and Fund every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates.
The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
Where the Scheme or Fund are in deficit following the triennial valuation, the group and the Trustee agree a deficit recovery plan.
Both the Scheme and Fund have formal deficit recovery plans which agree to make good the deficits over a certain period of time.
The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2012 showed a total funding deficit for both the Scheme and the Fund as 494m.
As a result of this, a recovery plan has been agreed of 55m a year until 2024.
The Scheme and the Fund liabilities have average duration of 23.4 years 2013: 23.1 years and 23.6 years 2013: 23.1 years respectively.
The expected undiscounted benefits payments to members of the Scheme and Fund, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the chart below: UNDISCOUNTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS m 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2015 2025 2035 2045 2055 2065 2075 Active and Deferred member cashows Pensioner cashows Annuity payments LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 186 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 27 Provisions continued ii Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit plans continued The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the fund is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the group.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the income statement but through the statement of comprehensive income.
The benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The group has no liability for retirement benefits other than for pensions, except for a small scheme in LGF Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire, which provides lump sum benefits on retirement.
The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 97% of worldwide assets of the groups defined benefit schemes.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes were: Fund and Fund and Scheme Scheme 2014 2013 % % 3.60 4.40 Rate used to discount liabilities 1 Rate of increase in salaries 2.30 2.30 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.40 3.70 4.30 4.20 Rate of increase in deferred pensions Rate of general inflation RPI 3.10 3.50 Rate of wage inflation 2.30 2.30 Post retirement mortality 2014: 100% Fund 85% Scheme of PCMA PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2011 base date 2000 with long-term rates 1.5% p. a males and 1.0% p. a females, with tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.

O n 1 December 2008, the conditions of the fund and scheme were amended to cap future pensionable salary increases at a maximum of 2.5% each year with effect from 1 January 2009: benefits accrued before that date have an underpin of the early leaver benefits.
This equates to average life expectancy as follows: Fund and Fund and scheme scheme 2014 2013 years years Normal retirement age 60.0 60.0 Male life expectancy at retirement age 89.0 88.9 Female life expectancy at retirement age 90.4 90.3 Male life expectancy at 20 years younger than retirement age 91.6 91.4 Female life expectancy at 20 years younger than retirement age 92.0 91.9 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 187 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Fund and Fund and Scheme Overseas Scheme Overseas 2014 2014 2013 2013 m m m m Movement in present value of defined benefit obligations 2,069 41 1,851 39 As at 1 January Current service cost 12 2 11 2 Interest expense 90 2 81 2 234 13 208 1 Actuarial remeasurement recognised in statement of comprehensive income Benefits paid 57 1 65 1 Exchange differences 1 17 Curtailment As at 31 December 2,348 56 2,069 41 Movement in fair value of plan assets As at 1 January 956 44 884 40 Expected return on plan assets at liability discount rate 42 2 39 2 124 9 38 1 Actuarial remeasurement recognised in statement of comprehensive income Employer contributions 68 1 60 2 Benefits paid 57 1 65 1 1 Exchange differences As at 31 December 1,133 54 956 44 1,215 2 1,113 3 Gross pension obligations Restricted surplus not recognised 3 Gross pension obligations included in provisions 1,215 2 1,113 723 646 Annuity obligations insured by Society Gross defined benefit pension deficit 492 2 467 Deferred tax on defined benefit pension deficit 98 93 Net defined benefit pension deficit 394 2 374 The total amount of actuarial losses net of tax recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year was 94 m: cumulative 741 m 2013: 145 m : cumulative 647 m. Actuarial losses net of tax relating to with-profits policyholders of 38 m 2013: 49 m have been allocated to the unallocated divisible surplus.
In 2013, a curtailment was recognised in the UK schemes due to the assignment of annuities to members with small pensions following the purchase of additional annuities in respect of future increments for them.
There is no curtailment in 2014.
The mortality base assumptions are aligned with those used by the schemes Trustees at the last valuation.
The effect of assuming reasonable alternative assumptions in isolation to the gross defined benefit pension deficit are shown below.
Opposite sensitivities are broadly symmetrical, but larger sensitivities are not necessarily broadly proportionate due to the existence of maxima and minima for inflation linked benefits.

For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date the liability is re-measured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash flows will be reflected in the fair value movement for a year.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation of the asset.
P ayables and other financial liabilities and fair value hierarchy have been restated to reflect the adoption by the group of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other liabilities include obligations under repurchase agreements of 7.0bn in 2014 2013: 3.2bn, amounts payables to brokers for the settlement of investment trades and net variation margins in 2014: 658m 2013: positive net variation margins of 306m on derivative contracts which are maintained daily.
Included within the variation margins are collateral held and pledged of 107m and 235m respectively 2013: 31m and 35m respectively.
The repurchase agreements are presented gross, however they and their related assets are subject to master netting arrangements.
Other includes future commission payments which have contingent settlement provisions of 186m 2013: 176m.
This liability has been determined using the net present value of the future commission which will be payable on fund values.
This valuation technique uses assumptions which are consistent with the groups effective rate of interest, investment return assumptions and persistency assumptions used in other valuations, but it is not determined by reference to published price quotations.
The undiscounted value which is expected to be paid at maturity in respect of such commission is 252m 2013: 247m.
Payables and other financial liabilities settled after 12 months are expected to be settled within five years with the exception of derivative liabilities, as disclosed in Note 14.

29 Operational risk Operational risk is defined as exposure to loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the groups businesses.
All business managers are required to confirm regularly the adequacy of controls to mitigate those operational risks relevant to their responsibilities.
Significant control issues are escalated to senior and executive management through the groups risk management framework.
The framework is supported by Risk Oversight teams which facilitate the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of risks across the groups businesses.
There are a number of categories under which operational risk and its management across the group can be considered, and these are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Internal process failure The group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from failure of the internal processes with which it transacts its business.
Each business division is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the controls over its processes.
Regular reviews are undertaken of their appropriateness and effectiveness.
People The group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from inappropriate actions by its staff.
Recruitment is managed centrally by HR functions, and all new recruits undergo a formal induction programme.
All employees have job descriptions setting out their accountabilities and reporting lines, and are appraised annually in accordance with agreed performance management frameworks.
Employees in regulated subsidiaries are provided with appropriate training to enable them to meet the relevant regulatory requirements.
Risks relating to health and safety and other legislation are managed through the provision of relevant training to all staff.
Outsourcing The group is potentially exposed to the actions or failure of suppliers contracted to provide services on an outsourced basis.
The group has defined minimum standards of control to be applied for all outsourced arrangements within a formal outsourcing and critical supplier policy.
Legal Legal risk is the risk of loss from unclear or deficient product documentation: inadequate documentation in support of material contracts such as reassurance treaties: the incorrect interpretation of changes in legislation: employment related disputes and claims: and commercial disputes with suppliers.
The groups product development and broader legal risk framework defines minimum standards of control to be applied to minimise the risk of loss.
Compliance Compliance risk within the group relates to the risk of non-adherence to legislative requirements, regulations and internal policies and procedures.
Responsibility for ensuring adherence to relevant legal and regulatory requirements is vested in individual business managers.
Regulatory risk functions have oversight of the groups compliance with conduct of business requirements and standards, providing policy advice and guidance and oversight of compliance arrangements and responsibilities.
Event Event risk relates to the potential for loss arising from significant external events such as terrorism, financial crisis, major changes in fiscal systems or disaster.
Typically, such events have a low likelihood of occurrence, a material impact and can be difficult to prevent.
The groups risk mitigation focuses on minimising the business disruption and potential financial loss which may ensue from such an event.
This includes maintaining a framework for the management of major incidents, the maintenance and regular testing of detailed business, technical and location recovery plans and the provision of insurance cover for the loss of buildings, contents and information technology systems and for the increased cost of working in the event of business disruption.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 191 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Fraud The group is potentially exposed to the risk of internal fraud, claims-related fraud, and external action by third parties.
The risk of internal fraud is managed through a number of processes including the screening of staff at recruitment, segregation of duties and management oversight.
The activities of Internal Audit also act to counter the risk.
Claims-related fraud is managed by ensuring business processes are designed to fully validate claims and ensure that only bona fide claims are settled.
Anti-fraud techniques are regularly updated to mitigate risks and emerging threats.
The groups approach to mitigating fraud and other dishonest acts is supported by promoting an open and honest culture in all dealings between employees, managers and those parties with which the group has contact.
A formal code of ethics sets out the groups expectations in this respect.
Effective and honest communication is essential if malpractice is to be effectively dealt with.
The group has defined whistle blowing procedures to enable all employees and those who work with Legal & General to raise matters of concern relating to Legal & General in confidence.
Technology The group places a high degree of reliance on IT in its business activities.
The failure of IT systems or a cyber event could potentially expose the group to significant business disruption and loss.
To mitigate this risk, standards and methodologies for developing, testing and operating IT systems in a secure manner are maintained.
Disaster recovery facilities enable IT operations to be conducted at remote locations in the event of the loss of computer facilities.
Contagion The potential for contagion risk arises as a consequence of the use of a common brand across the majority of the group and the provision of intra-group loans and indemnities.
The group has defined policies and procedures for managing matters that may have reputational implications, to ensure that Legal & Generals position is correctly understood.
The group also has defined policies for the provision of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 192 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 30 Management of capital resources Capital structure From a regulatory perspective the group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on an ongoing basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates.
At 31 December 2014, Legal & Generals unaudited Insurance Group Directive IGD capital resources were 3.9bn 2013: 4.0bn in excess of capital requirements of 3.8bn 2013: 3.3bn, representing a solvency coverage ratio of 201% 2013: 221%.
This surplus capital is after accruing for a 2014 final dividend of 496m 2013: 408m.
The group writes a range of long term insurance and investment business in the long term fund LTF of its main operating insurance subsidiary, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
This fund is segregated from the groups other assets.
The fund includes participating with-profits business where policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and rewards, and nonparticipating non profit business, where the shareholders receive profits or incur losses.
Capital in excess of the amount required to cover the liabilities is currently held within Society.
This capital provides support for new and existing non profit business within our UK non profit LGAS and Retirement businesses.
In January 2015, Legal & General announced the closure of the with-profits fund to new business.
There will be no change to how this fund is managed as a result of this closure.
The non-linked, non profit pensions and annuity business of Society is ceded, on arms length terms, to a wholly owned Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV, Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL.
Whilst an ISPV is not required to segregate policyholder assets within a LTF, LGPL continues to manage policyholder and shareholder assets separately for internal purposes.
Managed pension fund business is written through Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited PMC, which is a life company writing predominantly non-participating group pension business effected by trustees of occupational schemes in the UK or their equivalent overseas.
The assets are held in a LTF and are separate from other assets within the group.
In addition, the group operates a UK long term insurance business through Suffolk Life Annuities Limited.
General insurance business is written in the UK by Legal & General Insurance Limited, and long term insurance business is also written by LGA, LGN and LGF.
Capital management policies and objectives The group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the group include: Accounting bases Management use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and an Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
In addition, the supplementary accounts prepared using EEV principles provide further insight into the value of the business to shareholders.
Accordingly the groups net asset value and total capital employed are also analysed and measured on this basis.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
One of these regulatory measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA, measures capital using risk based stochastic techniques, and provides a measure of the level of economic capital required to run the groups business.
In addition, management assess financial strength under our current interpretation of the Solvency II rules.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by long term insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below: LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 193 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED UK regulatory basis Required capital for the life business is based on PRA rules.
Society must hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts: the first being calculated using the PRA rules specified by the Regulator pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the Company which is reviewed by the PRA pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying fixed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modified by the PRA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using PRA pillar 1 and pillar 2 requirements.
The pillar 1 calculation applies fixed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied in this business.
The group has developed an internal model to meet the future Solvency II requirements.
We anticipate that our Solvency II internal model will be approved in 2015, ready for use on the Solvency II go live date 1 January 2016.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is defined by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual firms, the group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
Available regulatory capital resources Capital resources available to meet regulatory UK capital requirements are determined using PRA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules are based on applicable GAAP, adjusted for admissibility, counterparty exposure limits and specific valuation differences.
The groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the different sources of capital held within the group.
The groups total available capital resources, under FRS 27 requirements, are 6.9bn 2013: 6.6bn of which 4.6bn 2013: 4.5bn is held by the life businesses.
The use of capital held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained by local regulatory requirements, and may not be available to provide funding for other businesses.
The total available capital resources of the groups with-profits business with-profits estate is determined in accordance with the Realistic Balance Sheet rules prescribed by the PRA.
At 31 December 2014, the excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities was 0.4bn 2013: 0.8bn, excluding the risk capital margin.
The capital resources reflect the surplus in that part of the fund which is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
The liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 196 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 30 Management of capital resources continued Available regulatory capital resource risks The groups available capital resources are sensitive to changes in market conditions, both to changes in the value of the assets and to the impact which changes in investment conditions may have on the value of the liabilities.
Capital resources are also sensitive to assumptions and experience relating to mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser extent, expenses and persistency.
The most significant sensitivities arise from the following four risks: market risk in relation to UK participating business which would crystallise if adverse changes in the value of the assets supporting this business could not be fully reflected in payments to policyholders because of the effect of guarantees and options.
The capital position of this business would also deteriorate if increases to the market cost of derivatives resulted in an increase in the liability for guarantees and options in the realistic balance sheet.
market risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the return from the fixed interest investments supporting this business were lower than that assumed for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the mortality of annuitants improved more rapidly than the assumptions used for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK and US term assurance businesses, which would crystallise if mortality of the lives insured was higher than that assumed, possibly because of an epidemic.
A range of management actions is available to mitigate any adverse impact from changing market conditions and experience, including pricing changes, cost management, reinsurance structure, investment strategy, changes to with-profits bonus rates, changes to discretionary surrender terms and charging for guarantees.
To the extent that management actions are expected only to offset partially adverse experience, then liabilities would be increased to anticipate the future impact of the adverse experience and total capital resources would be reduced.
Table 2 provides management estimates of the impact on the IGD surplus of changes in market conditions.

The above sensitivity analysis does not reflect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
In practice, the group actively manages its asset and liability positions to respond to market movements.
Additionally, the sensitivity tests are considered in isolation, although in practice there is likely to be a correlation between the scenarios.
The impacts of these stresses are not linear therefore these results should not be used to extrapolate the impact of a smaller or larger stress.
The results of these tests are indicative of the market conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results would be different if performed at an alternative reporting date.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 197 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Modelling improvements have been made in the year, which more accurately isolate the impacts of discrete assumptions changes.
This, coupled with the increase in the groups annuity liabilities, has led to an increase in the reported sensitivities to interest rates movements.
Zero yield floors have not been applied in the estimation of the stresses, despite the low interest rate environment at the balance sheet date.

Current tax Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Current tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values.
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.

The recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is supported by managements best estimate of future taxable profits to absorb the losses in future years.
These taxable profit projections are based on assumptions consistent with those used for EEV reporting purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset to the extent it is permissible under the accounting standard.

The move to a net deferred tax liability provision in the UK reflects the continued utilisation of tax losses and corresponding reduction in deferred tax asset while the deferred tax liability on actuarial reserves has increased.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 211 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED 39 Share-based payments The fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
i Description of schemes The group provides a number of equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.
The Savings related share option scheme SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the Performance Share Plan PSP, based upon individual and Company performance.
Prior to the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the groups relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
New performance conditions attached to the 2014 award result in the number of shares being transferred being equally dependent on the groups relative TSR and Earnings per Share EPS Dividend per Share DPS growth.
In addition, the shares vest evenly over three, four and five years.
The Company share option scheme CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved Executive share option scheme ESOS are designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers grade, salary and performance.
In order for the options to be exercisable, Legal & Generals TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.
Fair value is calculated using a binomial model, reflecting the historic exercise patterns.
The Share bonus plan SBP awards restricted shares and nil-paid options.
Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the Employee share plan ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 125.
From time to time, the group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.
The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE SAYE PSP Award date 3-Sep-14 9-Apr-14 11-Jun-14 Weighted average share price 243p 213p 232p Weighted average exercise price 191p 185p n a Expected volatility 28% 31% 30% Expected life 3-5 years 3-5 years 3-5 years Risk free investment rate 1.27%-1.78% 1.10%-1.80% 1.25% Dividend yield 3.9% 3.9% 3.9% LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 212 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED 39 Share-based payments continued ii Total recognised expense The total recognised expense relating to share-based payments in 2014 was 28m 2013: 23m before tax, all of which related to equity settled share schemes.

It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any group entity purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 216 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTINUED 44 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgements.
Various group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal and General Assurance Society Limited the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities, including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies liabilities under the Group Pension Fund and Scheme.
