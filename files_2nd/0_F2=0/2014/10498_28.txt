Governance 72 Corporate governance continued 2014 internal board evaluation process In line with best practice, we have conducted external evaluations at least once every three years.
As no material concerns were raised during the 2013 external evaluation the Boards determined that an internal evaluation would be carried out in 2014, recognising the opportunity this provides to reflect on the activities and performance of the Boards, committees and individual directors.
The process followed, which was facilitated by the company secretaries, is illustrated below: 1.
Reviewed prior year action plan and progress against plan 7.
Questionnaires agreed by the issued and Boards completed The report highlighted the positive and open dynamics of the Boards, noting the continued high degree of trust between the executive and non-executive directors.
One-on-one nominations interviews between committee and joint chairmen and recommendations individual directors made to the completed Boards 4. Review of joint chairmens 5.
Results performance by collated and SID and other report prepared directors completed The report highlighted the positive and open dynamics of the Boards, noting the continued high degree of trust between the executive and non-executive directors.
The robustness of debates and appropriate level of challenge, particularly during discussions of strategy and key business transactional agenda items, combined with the willingness to ask challenging questions, were of particular note.
