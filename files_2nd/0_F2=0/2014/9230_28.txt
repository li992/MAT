The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all years up to 2042 is 679.6 million 2013: 707.6 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 434.8 million 2013: 449.5 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 244.8 million 2013: 258.1 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2014 is 258.7 million 2013: 303.9 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 149.1 million 2013: 175.5 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 109.6 million 2013: 128.4 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2014 the Company has recognised a financial liability of 4.8 million 2013: 5.0 million in respect of these guarantees.
In addition to the passage of time, the liability has reduced in 2014 due to a number of factors.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
The default rate has been reduced as the remaining hotels under guarantee are considered to be in prime locations and furthermore have not suffered financially through the recent UK and European recession.
The 0.2 million credit arising as a result of these factors has been included within the Companys operating costs.
The table below provides a breakdown of the movement in the liability since 1 January 2014: Liability m At 1 January 2014 5.0 Reduction due to passage of time and a change in year end discount rate 0.2 At 31 December 2014 4.8 A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.4 million.
A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the financial liability by 0.4 million.

This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007 and will close to future accrual from 31 August 2015.
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2013.
The results of the 30 June 2013 actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2014 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the Plan.
The table also sets out as at 31 December 2014, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus or deficit of assets compared to the FRS17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability or asset and the net pension asset or liability.

The asset has been restricted to the present value of the liability expected to arise from future service, being the amount that could be expected to be recovered from reduced contributions to the plan.
The net pension asset for the company is lower than the net pension asset for the Group.
This is a result of technical differences between IAS19 and FRS17 regarding the size of an asset that can be recognised on the balance sheet.
The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the balance sheet date, using the figures shown above.
The sources used to determine the expected rates of returns include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 22.2% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional 441,667 per month to remove the shortfall in the funding identified at 30 June 2010 and 62,500 a month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.
The contributions made by the employers in 2014, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were 8.9 million 2013: 9.5 million.
The contribution schedule is due to be revised shortly.
Under this the level of employer contributions will be 27.1% of pensionable payroll in relation to the future accrual of benefits until the closure of the Plan at 31 August 2015, plus an additional 125,000 per month from April 2016 to June 2017 to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 June 2013 and 62,500 a month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the Plan.
These lead to an expected contribution of 3.7 million in 2015.
128 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 53 Financial statements NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The Plan is due to close to accrual on 31 August 2015.
Members were informed of this change in December 2014, following a consultation exercise and as such the impact of this change has been recognised within the 2014 profit and loss account.
The loss of 38.0 million recognised in the 2014 profit and loss account reflects the reduction in the pension asset that can be recognised as a result of the closure.
The impact on the present value of liabilities is different to this, the net reduction being 7.3 million reflecting the changes made.
The following table sets out the amounts charged to profit and loss and directly in equity for the year ended 31 December 2014 in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17, together with the prior year comparatives.
