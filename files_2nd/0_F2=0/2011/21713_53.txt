BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS continued Going Concern Whilst it is not currently anticipated that continuation votes will need to be put to any class of shareholders of the Company in the immediate future, the Board cannot be certain that the requirement for one or more continuation votes will not be triggered and, if continuation votes were triggered, it cannot be confirmed that any or all of such continuation votes would be passed.
Notwithstanding such uncertainty, the financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis in light of the Boards assessment of: shareholders appetite to continue their investments in the Company: and the expectation of the directors that the Company will continue for the foreseeable future.
