INCOME TAX CONTINUED The following factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium corporate tax rates greater than 26% and Ireland Poland Netherlands Czech Republic Slovakia corporate tax rates less than 26%.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with a corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 23.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been credited charged directly to equity and are shown in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax movement associated with actuarial loss 5.4 0.5 Current and deferred tax on share options 0.2 Tax charge on exchange and fair value movements arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 0.9 0.9 Change in rate 0.3 0.2 4.2 0.4 7.

A SAVE AS YOU EARN SAYE SCHEME The Company operates a SAYE scheme within the Republic of Ireland which is open to all employees and is linked to a monthly savings contract over three and five year periods.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at a percentage of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six month period three or five years from the date of grant.
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK since 2005.
Instead, the Company has operated a Share Investment Plan SIP since 2005 as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting see below.

No options were exercised in the year.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model in relation to the SAYE options granted in the prior year are as follows: Shares granted in 2010 Share price on date of official grant 100p 20 October 2010 Exercise price 95p Expected volatility 56.0% Actual life 3 and 5 years Risk free rate 4.5% Dividend 0.0p Expected percentage options exercised versus granted at date of grant: 3 years 50% 5 years 50% Revised expectation of percentage of options to be exercised as at 31 December 2011: 3 years 50% 5 years 50% No SAYE options were granted during the year.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors best estimate for the effects of behavioural conditions.
B EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES ESOS Under the existing ESOS for which the last options were granted in 2003, Directors and Senior Management can be awarded an annual grant of share options at market price, provided that the total amount payable by the individual to exercise options under the ESOS or any other share option scheme of the Group excluding savings related schemes granted during the immediately preceding ten years does not exceed four times base salary, bonus and benefits.
Share options under the ESOS are exercisable between three and ten years for the Inland Revenue approved scheme and three and seven years for the unapproved scheme from the date of grant.
The award would vest in full if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups earnings per share EPS is 6% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
None of the award would vest if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the RPI over the same period.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED C LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executives can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 100% of base salary.
2005 to 2008 ltip criteriA Awards under the 2005 to 2008 LTIPs are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The award vests if the following criteria are met: EPS % growth less RPI % growth over the three-year vesting period 2008 2007 2005-2006 Percentage of award vesting: none of the award vests 5% p. a.
3% p. a. award vests proportionately between 30% and 100% 5%12% p. a.
10% p. a No retesting of the performance criteria will occur.
2010 And 2011 ltip criteriA Awards under the 2010 and 2011 LTIP scheme are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
None of the award vests if, over the three year vesting period, the Groups cumulative underlying EPS is less than 30p.
The award vests proportionately if the Groups cumulative underlying EPS is between 30p and 40p, with the award vesting in full if the Groups cumulative underlying EPS is 40p or greater.
The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
Awards have also been made in 2010 and 2011 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED D DEFERRED ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME DABS Options were granted under the DABS scheme for the first time in 2005.
The DABS operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
Providing certain criteria are met, participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive nil cost matching shares up to a maximum of one per share purchased by the participant.
The criteria are as follows: 2005 to 2008 dAbS criteriA Percentage of award vesting Percentage growth in the Companys EPS over the three year period from the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made exceeds the percentage growth in the RPI over the same period by: less than 3% per annum compounded None of the award vests 3% per annum compounded 50% of the award vests between 3% and 5% per annum compounded Award vests proportionately between 50% and 100% 5% per annum compounded 100% of the award vests 2009 dAbS criteriA Awards under the 2009 DABS are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
None of the award vests if, at the end of the three year vesting period, the Groups underlying EPS is less than 10p.
25% of the award vests if the Groups underlying EPS is between 10p and 13.5p, with the full award vesting if the Groups underlying EPS is 13.5p or greater.
Between the two limits, the awards vest proportionately.

E SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN SIP Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is a HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2011, 50,635 2010: 48,622 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

Of the impairment charges, 11.1m 2010: nil relates to the disposal of the Groups UK Interiors Manufacturing business, and 0.3m 2010: 3.8m relates to asset write downs arising from the Groups cost saving and restructuring programme.
INTEREST IN ASSOCIATE The Groups share of operating income expense arising from its interest in associate, Ice Energy Technologies Limited Ice, for the year ended 31 December 2011 was a loss of 0.1m 2010: nil, which has been recognised on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
The only material transaction between SIG plc and its associate is a loan made by SIG plc to Ice amounting to 1.2m as at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010: 1.2m which is included within other receivables.
Interest receivable on the loan for the year was 51,000 2010: 24,000.
The loan is due for repayment in 2013.
Ice purchased goods and services from SIG plcs subsidiary undertakings amounting to 1.2m in 2011 2010: nil, of which 0.8m was outstanding as at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
The current accounting period for Ice ends on 31 March 2012.
The company does not have the same accounting reference date as SIG plc as the company operates independently of SIG, and therefore may independently select the accounting reference date it considers most appropriate.
The Group has a call option to purchase the remaining 75% shareholding of Ice in two phases, 26% in 2013, and the remaining 49% in 2015.

GOODWILL CONTINUED IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PROCESS The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may exist.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs to reflect the operational gearing of the Group.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
For those businesses not based in the UK or Western Europe, the cash flows are risk adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the individual CGU.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget and a projection of cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-3% over a further period of five years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry or economy.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates and range between 11% and 13%.
The most recent results of the impairment review process indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in one of the Groups CGUs, Central Europe, is currently unsupportable, and that an impairment is necessary.
2011 IMPAIRMENT REVIEW RESULTS While sales have grown strongly more than 10% in the Groups Central European business in 2011, given the extremely challenging economic environment in this region, exacerbated by the current Eurozone crisis, the recovery is now anticipated to take longer than previously envisaged.
This worsening outlook has therefore adversely affected projected future cash flows to the extent that the Directors have concluded that the remaining carrying value of goodwill of 7.0m and intangible assets of 4.0m are no longer supportable.
The Groups value in use calculation indicates an impairment in full, which has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement within Other items.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Group currently has 13 CGUs.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in turnover has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, no further impairments would arise, although in one CGU, Larivire, the remaining headroom would be relatively low.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecast associated with Larivire, noting its continued pattern of strong growth, and are satisfied that no impairment is necessary.
SUMMARY ANALYSIS Following these impairments, the recoverable amounts of goodwill in respect of all CGUs are fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK Distribution 83.4 83.4 UK Roofing and External Elements 80.8 80.8 UK Specialist Construction Products 22.6 22.6 Poland 8.7 10.2 Larivire 165.2 170.4 German Roofing 19.0 19.6 Central Europe 7.3 Air Trade Centre 11.4 13.8 Total 391.1 408.1 Other CGUs 40.3 39.0 Total goodwill 431.4 447.1 96 Accounts SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 14.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS The intangible assets presented below relate entirely to acquired intangibles.
These arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of acquired intangibles from goodwill.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2010 and 2011, the Group owned other purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

As a result of the annual impairment reviews referred to in Note 13, the Directors have decided that the carrying value of the intangible assets in relation to the Groups Central Europe business is no longer supportable.
This has led to an impairment charge of 4.0m relating to customer relationship assets.
The basis for this impairment is detailed in Note 13.
The disposals relate to the divestment of the Groups UK Interiors Manufacturing and UK Scaffolding businesses.
The net book value of intangible assets at both 31 December 2010 and at the date of disposal for these businesses was nil.

No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 31.1m at 31 December 2011 2010: 34.5m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 107.7m 2010: 103.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 27 days overdue 2010: 28 days.
AGEING ANALYSIS OF TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR WHICH NO PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT HAS BEEN MADE 2011 2010 m m Neither past due or renegotiated 242.9 249.5 Renegotiated Balances overdue which have no provision for impairment: 130 days 77.4 76.5 3160 days 24.0 19.6 6190 days 2.8 4.0 91120 days 1.5 1.2 121180 days 1.3 1.3 180 days 0.7 1.2 107.7 103.8 Total trade receivables 350.6 353.3 MOVEMENT IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL DEBTS 2011 2010 m m Beginning of year 34.5 35.0 Utilised 10.1 10.3 Disposals 0.4 Charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 8.1 10.8 Exchange differences 1.0 1.0 End of year 31.1 34.5 In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 47.1m 2010: 55.1m and a provision for impairment of 31.1m 2010: 34.5m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
CREDIT RISk MANAGEMENT Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

As noted in the Business Review on page 35, in March 2011 the Group signed a new 250m four year bank facility, at which point the Groups existing UK bank debt facilities were cancelled and repaid using cash held on deposit.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Treasury Risk Management section of the Business Review on pages 34 to 36 includes a review of all treasury, liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Business Review on page 28.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and derivative financial instruments.
The following financial assets form part of the net debt of the Group: 2011 2010 m m Cash at bank including cash deposits repayable on demand 126.9 129.5 Derivative financial instruments 52.7 52.0 179.6 181.5 The Directors consider the fair value of financial assets to approximate to their book value.
The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of interest of up to 2%.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Of the above cash at bank, 45.4m is denominated in Sterling, 65.8m in Euros, 12.6m in Polish Zloty, 1.9m in Czech Koruna, 0.5m in US Dollars and 0.7m in other currencies.
2011 INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY PROFILE The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2011, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments including derivative assets of 52.7m as noted above was as follows: Weighted effective average time Floating Fixed fixed for which Amount Amount Total rate rate interest rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % Years m m Private placement notes Sterling 139.5 14.4 125.1 4.3% 4.9 139.5 Private placement notes Euro 83.5 50.3 33.2 4.5% 1.8 83.5 Other borrowings Euro 11.8 11.2 0.6 5.2% 1.6 4.3 7.5 Finance lease contracts Euro 6.9 6.9 6.0% 3.2 6.9 Other borrowings PLN 0.3 0.3 N A N A 0.3 Finance lease contracts PLN 0.4 0.4 7.4% 5.0 0.4 Other borrowings HUF 0.4 0.4 N A N A 0.4 Total 242.8 76.6 166.2 12.3 230.5 In addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into two short term currency derivative financial instruments which alter the currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities.
A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of 44.4m and a liability of 53.0m was entered into on 31 December 2011 at market rates and therefore the fair value is deemed to equate to its book value of nil.
A currency derivative financial instrument which swapped CZK denominated financial liabilities into Sterling denominated financial liabilities was entered into on 31 December 2011, this amounted to an asset of 1.0m and a liability of CZK30.2m, the fair value of this derivative financial instrument is a liability of less than 0.1m.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2011 was 115.9m, of which 80.8m is denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling 7.3m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes approximates to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 7.9m and relates to finance lease contracts and fixed rate loans.
The Directors consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to materially approximate to the book values shown above.

Included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 10.5m 2010: 12.6m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 497.8m 2010: 574.8m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments overleaf are categorised as Level 2.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUED A net inveStment hedgeS As at 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2010: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro denominated debt.
In addition as at 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2010: one cross-currency forward contract which swaps Sterling denominated debt into Euro denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets.
Both of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as net investment hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into three 31 December 2010: five cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2011, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2010: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2011, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 4.2 years 2010: 4.0 years.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
A INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
To a lesser extent the Group is also exposed to Polish Zloty, Czech Koruna and Hungarian Forint interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

B FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars, Polish Zloty, Czech Koruna and Hungarian Forints.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
Therefore, in order to present a complete analysis of the Groups exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, the exposure on the Groups total assets and liabilities has been disclosed.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 29.
LEASEHOLD DILAPIDATIONS This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 29.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of prior year acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made within two years.
OTHER AMOUNTS Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and three years time.

DEFERRED TAX The net deferred tax asset at the end of the year is analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax assets 35.7 28.7 Deferred tax liabilities 20.8 26.5 Net deferred tax asset 14.9 2.2 SUMMARY OF DEFERRED TAX The different components of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period are analysed below: Goodwill Property, Retirement and plant and Tax benefit intangibles equipment assets obligations Losses Other Total m m m m m m m As at 31 December 2009 34.9 3.8 12.6 5.3 0.4 1.4 11.4 Credit charge to income 13.1 0.4 1.2 0.2 0.8 2.1 13.2 Credit to equity 0.5 0.2 0.7 Exchange difference 0.1 0.2 0.1 Change of rate 0.2 0.2 As at 31 December 2010 21.8 4.3 13.6 5.4 1.2 0.5 2.2 Credit charge to income 7.8 3.1 1.1 0.8 0.6 0.6 7.8 Credit to equity 5.4 5.4 Exchange difference 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.2 Change of rate 0.3 0.3 As at 31 December 2011 14.0 7.5 12.2 9.7 0.5 1.0 14.9 The deferred tax credit for 2011 includes a charge of 0.8m arising from the reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 25% which comes into effect on 1 April 2012.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
The Group has not taken account of excess non-trading losses associated with financial instruments in determining the above deferred tax asset at 31 December 2011.
During the year, the Group has utilised 14m gross of previously unrecognised deferred tax on non-trading losses.
In this respect, any future utilisation of the unrecognised deferred tax asset associated with the non-trading losses of 94m 2010: 108m will result in a reduction of cash payments of tax and will also result in a profit and loss benefit in the year of utilisation.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 13m 2010: 8m that have not been recognised on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in the Czech Republic of 5m and Poland of 1m expire after five years, the tax losses in Slovakia of 1m expire after seven years and the tax losses in The Netherlands of 2m expire after nine years.
The remaining tax losses of 4m may be carried forward indefinitely.
The total gross value of unrecognised tax losses at 31 December 2011 therefore amounted to 107m 2010: 116m.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 27m 2010: 30m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The multi-employer scheme is a defined benefit scheme but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow the assets and liabilities to be separately identified in relation to SIG plc.
Therefore, the Groups pension expense for this scheme for the year is the required contribution for that year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan decreased to 97.8% as at 31 December 2011 2010: 102.1%.
Because of the low coverage ratio, BPF HiBiN prepared and executed a recovery plan which was approved by the Dutch Central Bank.
Due to the low coverage ratio, the pension premium percentage increased to 22.2% from 2010 onwards previously 20.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
The Groups total pension charge for the year amounted to 7.5m 2010: 7.2m, of which 2.6m 2010: 2.4m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 4.9m 2010: 4.8m related to defined contribution schemes.
defined benefit penSion Scheme vAluAtionS In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefits pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2007 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 75.0m and their actuarial value covered 83% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
A formal actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2010 is currently being performed and it is anticipated that this will be finalised by 31 March 2012.
The other four schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
conSolidAted income StAtement chArgeS The pension charge for the year relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 2.6m 2010: 2.4m.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2011 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, has an age profile that is rising, and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
conSolidAted bAlAnce Sheet liAbility The balance sheet position in respect of the five defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2011 2010 m m Pension liability before taxation 44.5 25.2 Related deferred tax asset 9.7 5.4 Pension liability after taxation 34.8 19.8 The actuarial loss of 21.8m 2010: 1.8m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 5.4m 2010: 0.5m and deferred tax charge of 0.3m 2010: 0.2m in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of tax to 25% effective from 1 April 2012, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The remaining deferred tax charge of 0.8m 2010: charge of 0.2m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income amounted to a loss of 40.0m 2010: 18.2m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 38.8m 2010: 20.2m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 5.7m 2010: 5.0m relates to unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2011 2010 m m Pension liability at beginning of year 25.2 24.0 Current service cost 2.2 1.9 Contributions 4.9 2.8 Net finance cost 0.4 0.5 Actuarial loss 21.8 1.8 Exchange difference 0.2 0.2 Pension liability at end of year 44.5 25.2 Contributions of approximately 9.4m are expected to be paid to the plan during the annual period beginning 1 January 2012.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and have therefore not been disclosed.
During the year, Gerry Carr, a Director of the Groups Ireland business, exercised his option to sell his 20% non-controlling interest in Insulation Distributors Limited, an indirect subsidiary undertaking of SIG plc in Ireland, to the Group.
The original option agreement was signed in 1996 when the business was a start-up operation and the amount payable of 5.4m is based upon an agreed multiple of 2005 and 2006 profits.
Deferred consideration of 5.4m has been reclassified from accruals at 31 December 2011 in respect of the option, which was settled in cash in January 2012.
Following settlement of the option, the Group now owns 100% of the shares of Insulation Distributors Limited.
Also during the year, the Company exercised its option to purchase the remaining non-controlling interest of Air Trade Centre International B. V. for a consideration of 1.1m.
Following the purchase of this 5.4% shareholding, the Group now owns 100% of the shares in Air Trade Centre International B. V. but not 100% of the shares of all of the subsidiary businesses.
Other than the relationship disclosed in Note 11, the Group has not identified any other material related party transactions in the year to 31 December 2011.
