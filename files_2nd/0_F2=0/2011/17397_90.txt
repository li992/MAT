The onerous contracts provision relates to PFI school and hospital facilities management contracts in the UK segment relating to the Asset Management business.
The PFI provisions held are expected to be utilised over the next 19 years.
The vacant property provision is expected to be utilised over the next 11 years 2010: 8 years.

Post-employment benefit liabilities The Groups post-employment benefit liabilities are analysed below: Group 2011 2010 m m Retirement benefit liabilities 337.8 440.0 Other post-employment benefit liabilities 12.5 10.5 350.3 450.5 a Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The two main defined benefit schemes are the Atkins Pension Plan and the Railways Pension Scheme, both of which are funded final salary schemes.
The assets of both schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Plan in the Republic of Ireland, which is a final salary funded defined benefit scheme, and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent.
The UK Government announced on 8 July 2010 that private sector pension schemes should be able to link inflationary pension increases to the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI.
For the Railways Pension Scheme, the rules of the scheme imply that the move from RPI to CPI would impact the increases granted to pensions in payment and to increases granted to deferred pensions.
Calculations for the Railways Pension Scheme are therefore based on a CPI-based inflation assumption.
The effect of this change is to reduce the liabilities by 27m.
The Atkins Pension Plan continues to apply RPI for the purpose of indexation.
In the previous year, on 1 September 2009, the terms of the Railways Pension Scheme were amended to offer two options regarding future benefits.
The options were to receive future benefits linked to final salary in exchange for higher contributions or to receive future benefits linked to salary as at 1 September 2009 with future increases capped at inflation.
This resulted in a curtailment gain being reflected in the income statement of the Group.
Also during the prior year, as a result of a TUPE transfer, 49 members transferred out of the Atkins section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The bulk of the assets were transferred in January 2010 and the liabilities in respect of transferring members were valued at 31 December 2009.
The bulk transfer resulted in a settlement gain of 4.1m.
The Company also made a top-up payment to the receiving section to ensure full funding for protected members, which amounted to 1.8m.
The payment was made directly to the receiving section and so did not appear in the disclosures for the Atkins section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The net gain recognised in the income statement was 2.3m.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor information Financial Statements 125 The Atkins Pension Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits on 30 September 2007 and all members were transferred to a defined contribution section for future service where it was clear they did not enjoy a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension.
Although the service accrual under the defined benefit sections ceased for these members, the link to final salary currently remains whilst employed by Atkins Limited unless opting out or retiring if sooner.
The Atkins McCarthy pension scheme was closed to future accrual of benefits for members who do not enjoy a statutory or contractual right to a final salary pension.
These members transferred to the Personal Retirement Savings Accounts Ireland PRSA Irish Life scheme with effect from 1 April 2009.
The defined benefit sections of all pension schemes are closed to new entrants, who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.

Future improvements are based on CMI improvements with a 1.5% per annum improvement trend, based on year of use application.
The Railways Pension Scheme results have been adjusted on an approximate basis to be based on the same mortality tables.

b Other post-employment benefit liabilities The Group operates unfunded schemes within certain of its non-UK businesses including Gratuity Schemes, Key Employee Supplemental Option Plans KESOP and post-retirement medical benefit schemes.
Members of the Gratuity Schemes are entitled to receive a cash gratuity on leaving the business which is dependent on their length of employment and final salary.
Valuation of the gratuity obligation is carried out in line with the principles of IAS 19, Employee benefits.
The comparative figures shown for the year ended 31 March 2010 relate only to this scheme.
As a result of the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation, the Group now operates a KESOP plan providing key officers and employees with post-retirement benefits, known as the Supplemental Income Programme SIP.
The SIP is an unfunded plan that provides participants with retirement income for a specified period of between 5 and 15 years upon retirement, death or disability.
The plan fixes a minimum level for retirement benefits to be paid to participants based on the participants position at the company, their age and service at retirement.
Additionally, certain executive agreements have been amended to provide post-retirement medical benefits to those employees and their spouses, at a level substantially similar to those medical and hospitalisation benefits paid and provided to senior executives currently employed by the company.
The insurance benefits will be provided without any further or additional services from the employee to the company as they will be paid for and provided for as long as the employee and their spouse shall live.
