NOTE 6 TAXATION Recognised in the Group Income Statement 2011 2010 m m Current tax expense UK corporation tax 694 566 Foreign tax 181 128 Adjustments in respect of prior years 114 91 761 603 Deferred tax expense Origination and reversal of temporary differences 148 110 Adjustments in respect of prior years 12 124 Change in tax rate 57 3 103 237 Total income tax expense 864 840 A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
2 Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
The proposed reduction from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and has therefore been reflected in these Group financial statements.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
A resolution passed by Parliament on 29 March 2011 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 26% from 1 April 2011.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
None of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not reflected in these Group financial statements.
The effect of the changes enacted by Parliament on 29 March 2011 to reduce the corporation tax rate to 26%, with effect from 1 April 2011, is to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at the balance sheet date by 32m 46m increase in profit and 14m decrease in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The effect of the changes expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2011 to reduce the corporation tax rate from 26% to 25%, with effect from 1 April 2012, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at the balance sheet date by a further 32m 46m increase in profit and 14m decrease in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by 66m being 33m recognised in 2013 and 33m recognised in 2014.
