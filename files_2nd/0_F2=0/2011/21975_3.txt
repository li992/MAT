Acquired intangible assets decreased by 79m during 2011 to 209m, principally due to amortisation of 61m, impairments of 10m and the impact of foreign exchange movements.
Property, plant and equipment and software Property, plant and equipment and internally developed and purchased software decreased by 362m to 16,446m at 31 March 2011, principally due to capital expenditure of 2,590m, further details of which are given below, which was more than offset by 2,979m of depreciation and amortisation.
