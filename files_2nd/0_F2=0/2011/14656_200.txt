Contingent liabilities and assets In prior years, the Group has disposed of a number of properties for which it remains contingently liable for the head leases should the assignee default on the terms of the lease.
This may result in a number of leases reverting to the Group for which the annual net exposure to the Group is considered unlikely to exceed 6m per annum.
At 21 August 2010 a contingent asset of 18.8m existed in relation to the Groups outstanding gaming machine VAT claim.
A decision was released during 2010 in respect of the Rank Group plcs gaming claim, and this latest ruling fell in the taxpayers favour.
As a result, the Group was able to further pursue its own gaming claim and, during the period to 20 August 2011, the Groups claim was repaid by HMRC.
HMRC agreed to make the repayment of the existing claim, subject to the Group providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision in the Rank Group plc is overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
The decision in relation to the Rank Group plcs claim has been referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The Group has therefore recognised the repayment amount as a provision, until the Rank Group plc case has reached its final conclusion.
