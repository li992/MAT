30. financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups financial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks, which have an adverse impact on the value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities or on reported profitability and on the cash flows of the Group.
The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans, bank revolving facilities, other loans and finance leases.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts.
It is, and has been throughout 2010 and 2009, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The Groups main treasury risks relate to the availability of funds to meet its future requirements and fluctuations in interest rates.
The treasury policy of the Group is determined and monitored by the Board.
The Group monitors its cash resources through short, medium and long-term cash forecasting, against available facilities.
Surplus cash is pooled into an interest bearing account with the Groups bankers.
The Group monitors its overall level of financial gearing monthly, with short and medium-term forecasts showing levels of gearing within targets.
It is the Groups policy not to exceed a ratio of 1:1 of adjusted net debt to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group includes within adjusted net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, bank revolving facilities, less cash and cash equivalents and excludes, for this calculation, the Dominos Leasing Limited non-recourse loans and the Dominos Germany non-controlling interest loan.
The Dominos Germany non-controlling interest loan is excluded from the Groups net debt calculation as it does not form part of the long term funding strategy of the Group.

fide Notes to the Group financial statements continued 30. financial risk management objectives and policies continued The Group Balance Sheet shows a net current liability position as at 25 December 2011.
This is because the Groups 25m RCF is due for renewal in December 2012 and has therefore been classified as a current liability.
Although current economic conditions create uncertainty over the general availability of bank financing, the Group has no reason to believe that a renewal may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations in the Republic of Ireland and Germany and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, the Euro in particular.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its currency exposures by agreeing fixed Euro rates with franchisees and suppliers wherever possible.
The Board does not consider there to be any significant unmitigated foreign currency risk in relation to the Groups profit before tax.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Sterling against Euro exchange rates with all other variables held constant, of the Groups equity due to changes in the carrying value of Euro denominated assets in subsidiaries with a Sterling functional currency and Sterling denominated assets in subsidiaries with a Euro functional currency : Increase decrease in Effect Sterling vs on profit Euro rate before tax % 000 2011 25 504 -25 840 2010 25 5 -25 8 Credit risk Customers who trade on credit terms and obtain finance leasing from the Group are predominantly franchisees and it is considered that the franchisee selection process is sufficiently robust to ensure an appropriate credit verification procedure.
Non-recourse loans are only repayable provided the related lease receivables are settled in full.
This limits the Groups exposure to the non-repayment of other lease receivables.
In addition, trade receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide guarantees as required under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
It is Group policy that cash deposits are only made with banks that have been approved by the Board and have a high credit rating in accordance with the Groups treasury policy to ensure that the Group is not exposed to unnecessary risk.
Price risk The Board considers that the Groups exposure to changing market prices on the values of financial instruments does not have a significant impact on the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
As such no specific policies are applied currently, although the Board will continue to monitor the level of price risk and its exposure should the need occur.

All major investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process.
In this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising.
Financial liabilities due within 3 months of the period end will be settled by the Group using cash and receipts from trade receivables outstanding at the period end.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 25 December 2011 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Whilst fixed rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to benefit from a reduction in borrowing costs when market rates are declining.
Conversely, whilst floating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk as costs are impacted by changes in market rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on the period end floating rate cash balances and borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
