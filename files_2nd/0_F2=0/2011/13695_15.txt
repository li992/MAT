Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Significant accounting policies RPS Group Plc the Company is a company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 7 March 2012. a Basis of preparation The Group has prepared its annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the UK.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
During 2011 the IASB has issued a variety of IFRIC amendments and interpretations that have no impact on the Groups reporting.
The Group has augmented its accounting policy in respect of deferred consideration d and added policies in respect of negative goodwill e ii and operating profit g. Otherwise, these financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies set out in the Report and Accounts 2010.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
c Revenue Revenue is stated net of sales tax.
Revenue is recognised only when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
i Fees expenses Revenue is classified into Fee revenue and Expense revenue.
Fee revenue represents the Groups personnel, subcontractor and equipment time and expertise sold to clients.
Expense revenue is the recharge of costs incidental to fulfilling the Groups contracts, for example mileage, flights, subsistence and accommodation.
ii Time and materials In the case of time and materials projects, revenue represents the fair value of services provided using time spent at agreed rates as the basis.
iii Fixed price In the case of fixed price contracts, revenue is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
iv Tuition Tuition fees in respect of courses run by RPS are recognised over the period of instruction.
v Agency agreements The Group enters into certain agreements with clients where it manages client expenditure.
It is obliged to purchase third party services and recharges those costs, plus a management fee, to the client.
In these cases only the management fee is recognised as revenue.
Receivables, payables and cash related to these transactions are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Accrued revenue is booked as a receivable in the consolidated balance sheet when the amount of revenue recognised on a contract exceeds the amount invoiced.
Where the amount invoiced exceeds the amount of revenue recognised, the difference is booked as a payable on the balance sheet in deferred income.
Significant accounting policies continued d Deferred consideration Deferred consideration arises when settlement of all or part of the cost of a business combination falls due after the date the acquisition was completed.
i IFRS 3 2004 At the date of acquisition, deferred consideration is stated at the fair value of the total consideration outstanding.
In these cases all deferred consideration has been treated as part of the cost of investment.
At each balance sheet date deferred consideration comprises the fair value of the remaining deferred consideration valued at acquisition.
ii IFRS 3 2008 Where the payment of deferred consideration is not contingent upon continuing employment of the vendors by the Group, deferred consideration is treated in the same way as under IFRS 3 2004.
Where the payment of deferred consideration is contingent upon the continuing employment of vendors by the Group, it is treated as a remuneration expense and accounted for as an employment benefit under IAS 19.
A charge is made through the consolidated income statement as a cost of employment.
The cost associated with each payment is accrued over the period it is earned.
At each balance sheet date the contingent deferred consideration balance comprises the accrual for the unsettled remuneration expense to date.
Contingent deferred consideration treated as remuneration is included in the cash flow statement as deferred consideration.
e Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries and the business, assets and liabilities of partnerships.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Negative Goodwill Negative goodwill arises where the purchase price of acquisitions for accounting purposes is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired and is immediately credited to the consolidated income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 2008. iii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets identified in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
The fair values ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in income as an expense as incurred.
iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis from the date that the intangible assets are available for use over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite.
The estimated useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are as follows: Customer relationships 3 to 15 years Trade names 1 to 5 years Order backlog 1 to 4 years Non complete agreements 5 years Software 10 years Intellectual property nights 10 years 42 Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts f Impairment of non financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each annual balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement unless the asset is recorded at a revalued amount in which case it is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus has previously been recorded.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010. i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
g Operating profit The Board has disclosed four non statutory performance measures as part of the Consolidated Income Statement.
These are Operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs, Profit before tax, amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs, Adjusted basic earnings per share and Adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The Board considers these to be more meaningful measures of business performance than the statutory measures Operating profit, Profit before tax, Basic earnings per share and Diluted earnings per share.
The Board has also shown in note 3 segment underlying profit which is segment result before reorganisation costs and amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs.
The Board considers this measure to be a more meaningful measure of performance than the measure segment result.
i Amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs note 4 This classification of income and expense comprises amortisation of acquired intangibles see note 1 e iv, deferred consideration payments that are contingent on continuing employment and are treated as remuneration see note 1 d ii, negative goodwill that has been credited to the income statement see note 1 e ii, gain on revaluation to fair value of investment in associate upon acquisition of all outstanding share capital note 28 and third party transaction related costs.
ii Reorganisation costs This classification of income and expense comprises costs arising as a consequence of reorganisation including redundancy costs, profit or loss on disposal of plant, property and equipment, the costs of consolidating office space and rebranding costs.
An explanation of adjusted earning per share is given in note 10. h Key accounting estimates and judgements These significant accounting policies also require the use of judgement, in particular when to recognise revenue, the valuation methods used to ascribe value to intangible assets arising on acquisition and the discount rates and growth rates used when performing impairment reviews.

Other accounting policies a Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in income.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to translation reserve.
They are recycled and taken to income upon disposal of the operation.
iv Foreign currency forward contracts Foreign currency forward contracts are initially recognised at nil value, being priced-at-the-money at origination.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value determined by price changes in the underlying forward rate, the interest rate, the time to expiration of the contract and the amount of foreign currency specified in the contract.
Changes in fair value are recognised in income as they arise.
b Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy 1 f above.
ii Leased assets Leases which contain terms whereby the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item are classified as finance leases.
Assets acquired under a finance lease are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value of the leased assets, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities net of finance costs allocated to future periods.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalised.
iii Subsequent costs The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
iv Depreciation Depreciation is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Alterations to leasehold premises Life of lease Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures, fittings, IT and equipment 3 to 8 years c Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at cost and carried out at cost less impairment losses.
Trade and other receivables are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses are taken to the income statement as incurred.
44 Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts d Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
e Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payments The Group operates share based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity settled awards for share based payments is determined at grant and exposed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The Group has calculated the fair market value of options using a binomial model and for whole share awards the fair value has been based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant adjusted to take into account some of the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted.
Those fair values were charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting period adjusted to reflect actual and expected vesting levels.
The Group has not relied on the exemption afforded under IFRS 1 to exclude instruments granted before 7 November 2002.
Prior to 2004, the Group granted options and super options to employees under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and Save as You Earn SAYE scheme.
Under the ESOS, share options are granted at the market price on the date of grant with the exercise of options subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance conditions and continuity of employment provisions.
For SAYE options, share options are granted at the market price on the date of grant.
Employees can exercise the SAYE option at the end of their savings contract.
Since 2004 the Group has incentivised and motivated employees through the grant of conditional share awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Bonus Banking Plan BBP for Executive Directors and other senior directors: the Performance Share Plan PSP, for senior managers and staff, and the Share Incentive Plan SIP, available to staff.
Under these arrangements shares are granted at no cost to the employee.
The release of shares granted under the LTIP, BBP and PSP are subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance conditions and continuity of employment provisions.
Share holder approval has lapsed for the LTIP and therefore no further grants will be made under this plan.
The release of shares under the SIP are subject to continuity of employment provisions.
iii Accrued holiday pay Provision is made at each balance sheet date for holidays accrued but not taken, to the extent that they may be carried forward, calculated at the salary of the relevant employee at that date.
f Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
g Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Trade payables with a short useful life are not discounted.
h Borrowings Bank overdrafts and interest bearing loans are initially measured at cost.
i Reserves The description and purpose of the Groups reserves are as follows: rpsgroup.

Other accounting policies continued Share premium Premium on shares issued in excess of nominal value, other than on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.
Merger reserve Premium on shares issued in respect of acquisitions when merger relief is taken.
Employee trust Own shares held by the SIP and ESOP trusts.
Translation reserve Cumulative gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling.
Retained earnings Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of changes in equity.
j Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
k Income tax Income tax on the income for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In accordance with IAS12, deferred tax is taken directly to equity to the extent that the intrinsic value of the outstanding share awards based on the closing share price is greater than the share based payment expense already charged to the income statement.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
l Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when they are paid.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
m Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP As the Company is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, it is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purpose of the Group accounts.
The ESOPs assets other than investments in the Companys shares, liabilities, income and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements.
The ESOPs investment in the Companys shares is deducted from shareholders funds in the Group balance sheet as if they were treasury shares.
Proceeds from the sale of ESOP shares in excess of the cost of those shares is not credited to the share premium account.
n Accounting standards issued but not adopted The IASB and the IFRIC have issued additional standards which are effective for periods starting after the date of these financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations which would have an impact on the Groups reporting, have yet to be adopted by the Group: n Amendments to IFRS 1: severe hyperinflation and removal of n IFRS 9 Financial instruments fixed dates for first time adopters.
n IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 46 Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts n IFRS 11 Joint arrangements n Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying assets n IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities n Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and n IFRS 13 Fair value measurement financial liabilities n Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures: offsetting financial assets n IAS 19 Employee benefits June 2011 and financial liabilities n IAS 27 Separate financial statements May 2011 n Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of items of other comprehensive income n IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures May 2011 None of these standards has been endorsed by the EU.
The Group is still assessing the impact that these changes will have on its reporting.
3. Business and geographical segments Segment information is presented in the financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The business segment reporting format reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Business segments As announced on 3 November 2011 the Group merged Planning and Development UK and Ireland and Environmental Management.
The business segments of the Group are as follows: Built and Natural Environment BNE - consultancy services advising on all aspects of the built and natural environment including the provision of energy infrastructure, planning and development, engineering, design and surveying, environmental assessment and management and risk management.

Tax Law Amendment 2010 Measures No.
1 Act 2010 was enacted in Australia during July 2010 and amends the tax treatment of certain assets acquired in business combinations.
The impact is to retrospectively reduce the income tax liability for the head company of the Australian tax group for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2009 when acquisitions entered the tax group.
The tax expense for 2011 is reduced by 238,000 2010: 1,754,000 in relation to the impact of this legislation.
The Budget announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 23 March 2011 included changes to the main rates of tax for UK companies.
The main rate of corporation tax will reduce to 25% from 1 April 2012.
The reduction to 25% is included in the Finance No.
This change of rate became substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS12 - Income Taxes on 5 July 2011 when the bill received its third reading in the House of Commons.
The group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 25%.
This has resulted in recognition of a deferred tax credit of 176,000 in the income statement and recognition of a deferred tax credit of 216,000 in equity.
The Chancellor has also announced his intention to reduce the rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014.
As these changes have not been substantively enacted at 31 December 2011 they have not been recognised in the financial statements.
Had these changes been enacted, the cumulative effects would have been credits to the income statement of 91,000 24%, or 182,000 23%, and credits to equity of 179,000 24% or 358,000 23%.
Earnings per share The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share were based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the related period as shown in the tables below: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 000s 2011 2010 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 29,111 31,736 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share 215,727 214,737 Effect of employee share schemes 1,547 1,311 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share 217,274 216,048 Basic earnings per share pence 13.49 14.78 Diluted earnings per share pence 13.40 14.69 The directors consider that earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangible and transaction related costs and the effect of the change in Australian tax law provides a more meaningful measure of the Groups performance than statutory earnings per share.
The calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share were based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year as shown above, the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders before the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, transaction related costs and the tax thereon and the change in Australian tax law as shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2011 2010 Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 29,111 31,736 Amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs note 4 10,361 5,524 Tax on amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related costs 3,256 1,598 Change in Australian tax law note 9 238 1,754 Adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 35,978 33,908 Adjusted basic earnings per share pence 16.68 15.79 Adjusted diluted earnings per share pence 16.56 15.69 rpsgroup.

Deferred consideration treated as remuneration Where contingent deferred consideration is now treated as remuneration for acquisitions completed in 2010 there is a reduction in goodwill brought forward of 7,439,000.
This adjustment is not considered to be material and so the prior year balance sheet has not been restated in accordance with IAS 8 see note 28.

The Group reorganised its management structure during 2011 and has reflected this in new reportable segments as disclosed in note 3.
The Group has reviewed and represented the allocation of goodwill to CGUs as a result of this reorganisation.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2011 2010 Built and Natural Environment UK and Ireland 142,910 143,843 Netherlands 9,723 9,856 Europe 152,633 153,699 Australia Asia Pacific 54,060 40,895 206,693 194,594 Energy 66,866 84,587 273,559 279,181 The Group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Management have not identified any impairment triggering events in the period since the last annual review.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and the growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Thereafter, a perpetuity is applied to the final years cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rates applied, the growth rates and margins assumed over the forecast period.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
The Group bases its estimate for the long term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The inputs to this calculation are derived from long term market and industry data.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs were in the range 11% to 13%.
Growth rates The growth rates applied reflect managements expectations regarding the future performance of the business.
These incorporate the effects of the global recession over the last three years, the expected recovery of the CGUs affected and the past experience of the Group as it emerged from previous recessions.
They also reflect the expected benefits of the reorganisation of the Europe business announced on 3rd November 2011.
The long term growth rates applied to the perpetuity calculations were in the range 2.25% to 2.4% per annum reflecting the average long term growth rates of the economies in which the CGUs are based.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charge resulting 2010: nil.
In the Directors view, the results are most sensitive to the discount rate used and a 1% absolute movement in the value of the WACC is reasonably possible.
If that movement occurred the Group would not recognise any impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill in any CGU.

IFRS 3 2008 Business Combinations became applicable to the Group with effect from 1st January 2010.
The Group reviewed the requirements of this standard and determined that deferred consideration could continue to be treated as consideration for the acquisition and therefore capitalised.
In 2011 the Groups new auditors, who interpret this standard differently, advised the Group that the deferred consideration that was contingent on continuing employment should be recognised as a remuneration charge through the Consolidated Income Statement rather than be capitalised.
This revised treatment of deferred consideration impacts the Group accounts in the following ways: 1.
In respect of 2010 acquisitions the Group has derecognised the deferred consideration payable that was previously shown in the balance sheet on the date of acquisition of subsidiaries.
The value of goodwill has been reduced by a corresponding amount since deferred consideration is no longer considered part of the cost of investment: 2.
For those acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 where the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the consideration transferred, the Group has recognised negative goodwill through the consolidated income statement: and 3.
A remuneration charge has been recognised through the consolidated income statement and a corresponding accrual has been recognised in the balance sheet under deferred consideration.
The Group has calculated the impact of this revised treatment on the 2010 accounts and has determined that it is not material as omitting that information from the comparative results in the Report and Accounts for 2011 would not influence the decisions that users make about the Group.
Therefore the 2010 accounts have not been restated and the impact has been included in the 2011 accounts.
A reconciliation of goodwill in respect of acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 is given in the table below.

Financial Risk Management a Capital management The capital of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings and facilities disclosed in note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 and 22.
The Group manages its capital to support its strategy, and there were no changes in approach to capital management during the year.
The borrowings are managed centrally and funds are onward lent to operating subsidiaries as required.
The main borrowing facility of the Group is a 125 million multi currency revolving credit facility that provides a high degree of flexibility.
There are two financial covenants related to this facility, interest cover being group profit before interest and tax as a percentage of interest paid and payable must be no less than 400% and the ratio of group net borrowings to EBITDA of the Group should be no greater than 325%.
These covenants are tested regularly and were not breached during the year and have not been since.
The Groups businesses provide a good level of cash generation which helps fund future growth.
The Group seeks to minimise borrowings by utilising cash generated by operations that is surplus to the immediate operating needs of the business and an objective is to maintain a minimum level of cash at bank.
At the year end the balance is higher than the average month end balance during the year due to good cash collections toward the end of December.
b Financial instruments The Groups financial assets comprise cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise bank loans, deferred consideration and trade and other payables.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Fair values The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are considered to be materially equivalent to their book value.
The classification of financial instruments is shown in the table below.
As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2011 2010 Cash 25,989 13,933 Trade and other receivables 171,751 158,766 Financial assets 197,740 172,699 Borrowings 49,513 45,470 Deferred consideration 10,327 18,534 Trade and other payables 111,161 88,023 Financial liabilities 171,001 152,027 Interest rate and currency risk are the most significant aspects for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to liquidity risk that is reviewed in note 16.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
c Interest rate risk The Group draws down term loans, typically between one and three months, against its revolving credit facility in US Dollars, GB Pounds, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Euro at fixed rates of interest for the term of the loan.
The Group has not entered any contracts to fix interest rates beyond the period of the term loans but will consider doing so if borrowings becomes significantly larger and longer term.
The Groups overdraft bears interest at floating rates.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term deposit or held within accounts bearing interest related to bank base rate.

There are no interest bearing trade and other receivables.
Borrowing facilities The Groups undrawn borrowing facilities comprise revolving credit facilities that expire in 2013 where interest costs are fixed at the time drawings are made.
During 2011, the Group had an overdraft facility expiring within one year, carrying floating rate interest.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2011 2010 Expiring in more than one year but not more than 2 years 79,728 Expiring in more than 2 years but not more than 5 years 83,936 Interest rate sensitivity A 1.0% decrease in interest rates would increase Group profit before tax by 365,000.
A further 1.0% increase in interest rates would decrease Group profit before tax by 365,000. d Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investments in overseas operations in the Netherlands, Ireland, USA, Canada and Australia that have functional currencies other than sterling.
As a result the Groups balance sheet and income statement can be affected by movement in the exchange rate between sterling and the functional currencies of overseas operations.
The most important exchange rates as far as the Group is concerned is the GB Pound to Australian dollar rate.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts held at year end was not material.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposures.
A number of the Groups operations transact in currencies other than their functional currency.
This creates a foreign currency exposure that is monitored and hedged centrally.
Foreign currency sensitivity Since the Group hedges its transactional foreign currency, the sensitivity of the results to transactional foreign currency risk is not material.
e Credit Risk It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
The Group does not enter into complex derivatives to manage credit risk.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider the Groups financial assets that are not impaired to be of good 70 Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts credit quality including those that are past due.
See note 14 for further detail on receivables that are past due.
The groups financial assets are not secured by collateral advanced by counterparties.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.

Events after the balance sheet date Since the year end the Group has exchanged contracts to dispose of that part of Built and Natural Environment Europe, which provides facilities management support to clients in Ireland.
The consideration for the goodwill and contracts is 1,500,000.
Certain other assets of the business will be sold at net book value whilst trade receivables will be retained and certain liabilities will be assumed by the acquirer.
All staff engaged directly in this business are expected to transfer to the acquirer.
Subject to a TUPE process, this disposal will complete in late March.
Commitments and contingencies The Group has completed a number of acquisitions since 1st January 2010 where deferred consideration payments to vendors are contingent on the vendors continued employment with the Group and so are recognised as employment costs over the deferred consideration period.
The Group consider it probable that these deferred consideration payments will be paid.
The total cash commitments in respect of contingent deferred consideration treated as remuneration that the Group expects to settle and the estimated remuneration charge for each financial year assuming exchange rates remain constant are disclosed in the table below: Cash Remuneration 000s commitment charge 2012 10,341 8,879 2013 7,760 5,962 2014 3,563 1,126 21,664 15,967 The balance sheet at 31st December 2011 includes, within deferred consideration amount due within one year, contingent deferred consideration remuneration expense accrued but not paid totalling 5,697,000. rpsgroup.
