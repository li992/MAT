Of the total contractual obligations of $89,148,000, $39,812,000 relates to the Companys share of obligations for its joint arrangements.
The Company may have a potential residual obligation to satisfy any shortfall in officers and former officers secured real estate borrowings in the event of default, a shortfall on the proceeds from the disposal of the properties and the individuals being unable to repay the balance.
The value of the residual obligation was estimated as insignificant.
In many of the countries in which the Group operates, land title systems are not developed to the extent found in many industrial countries and there may be no concept of registered title.
Although the Group believes that it has title to its oil and gas properties, it cannot control or completely protect itself against the risk of title disputes or challenges.
There can be no assurance that claims or challenges by third parties against the Groups properties will not be asserted at a future date.
The Group received a letter from the Iraq Ministry of Oil dated 17 December 2007 stating that the Production Sharing Contract PSC signed with the Kurdistan Regional Government without the prior approval of the Iraqi government is considered to be void by the Iraqi government as they have stated it violates the prevailing Iraqi law The Directors believe that the PSC is valid and effective pursuant to the applicable laws.
The Group received a letter from the Chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Company of Libya dated 28 February 2008 stating that the Block 7 licence area lies within the Libyan continental shelf and a portion of this area has already been licensed to Sirte Oil Company.
This letter also demands that the Group refrain from any activities over, or concerning, the Block 7 licence area and asserts the Libyan governments right to invoke Libyan and international law to protect its rights in the Block 7 licence area.
The Directors believe that the Libyan governments claims are unfounded.
