Notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Accounting policies With the exception of the accounting policy in respect of business combinations see below, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
The Group separately presents acquisition amortisation and specific non-recurring items in the income statement which, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
Specific non-recurring items include amounts relating to restructuring costs: pension curtailment gains: contingent payments on acquisition treated as remuneration: net inventory write-offs in respect of capitalised DTR-programme bid costs: impairment of property, plant and equipment: impairment of intangible assets: gain loss on business combinations and divestments: unrealised impairments of investments: and tax thereon.
Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 103-105.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant financial assets and liabilities.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 March 2011.
The purchase method of accounting has been adopted.
Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost usually on acquisition and disposal respectively.
A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies in order to obtain benefits.
Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when determining control.
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%-50% of the equity voting rights, over financial and operating policy.
A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount.
Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Groups share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies.
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.
Revenue Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added and other sales taxes on the following bases: Service contracts The Groups service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 Revenue.
Revenue is recognised once the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
This is typically when title passes or contractually agreed-upon milestones are reached and accepted by the customer.
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
The Group generally does not undertake construction contracts.
Goods sold Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.
Royalties and intellectual property Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates.
Intellectual property revenue can be attributed to either perpetual licences or limited licences.
Limited licences are granted for a specified time period and revenue is recognised over the period of the licence.
Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited time frames and are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Segmental information Segmental information is presented according to the Groups management structure and markets in which the Group operates.
A simplified structure has been implemented with effect from 1 April 2010 comprising three divisions: US Services, UK Services and Global Products.
This enables greater clarity around markets and customers aligning the Groups capabilities in order to leverage existing strengths and address weaknesses systematically.
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2010 have been restated to reflect the reorganised structure adopted at the start of the current financial year.
The segments previously reported were Europe, Middle East and Australasia EMEA, QinetiQ North America QNA and Ventures.
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group.
Corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Unallocated items comprise mainly profit on disposal of non-current assets, business divestments and unrealised impairment of investments, financing costs and taxation.
Eliminations represent inter-company trading between the different segments.
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.
Research and development expenditure Research and development costs incurred on behalf of a customer as part of a specific project are directly chargeable to the customer on whose behalf the work is undertaken.
Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project.
Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
All other research and development costs are expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed.
Financing Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial income earned on funds invested.
Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement are included within interest income and expense in financing.
Taxation The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to items charged or credited to equity in which case the relevant tax is charged or credited to equity.
Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Any change in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for as follows: Business combinations on or after 1 April 2010 IFRS 3, Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration and share based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If a business combination relates in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element, is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
56 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional fees and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
Non-controlling interests are measured at either the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised or at fair value.
The method used is determined on an  basis.
Business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 IFRS 3, Business Combinations 2004 The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Previously held identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are revalued to their fair value at the date of acquisition, being the date at which the Group achieves control of the acquiree.
The movement in fair value is taken to the asset revaluation reserve.
Upon initial acquisition of a non-controlling interest, the interest of minority shareholders is measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.
Intangible assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, typically between 0-9 years.
Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.
Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation.
Intangible assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight line basis as follows: Intellectual property rights 2-8 years Development costs Useful economic life or unit of production method subject to a minimum amortisation of no less than straight line method over economic life of 1-4 years Other 1-9 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible non-current assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: Freehold buildings 20-25 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease Plant and machinery 3-10 years Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Computers 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date.
In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and interest.
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually, and if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible, goodwill, intangible and held for sale assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash generating unit are written down to their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash generating unit calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.
QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Investments in debt and equity securities Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available for sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses.
When these investments are fide-recognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unquoted equity investments are held at fair value based upon the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.
Inventories Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost.
Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost.
Bid costs Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred.
In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding process typically involves a competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close with the customer.
In these cases, the costs incurred after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress.
From the point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life of the contract.
If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs deferred to that point will be expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not be achieved.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced.
Payments received on account are included in trade and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash.
In the cash flow statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents.
Current and non-current liabilities Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group.
Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet.
Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method.
If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments.
Fair value hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement.
The hedged item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedging Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability.
Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
58 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Hedging of net investment in foreign operations Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity are recognised in equity until the net investment is sold or disposed.
Any ineffective portion is recognised directly in the income statement.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments and fair value at the inception of the lease.
Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates.
Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction.
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period.
Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Post-retirement benefits The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined using the projected unit credit method.
Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out half yearly for the largest plans and on a regular basis for other plans.
Actuarial advice is provided by external consultants.
For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively.
For defined benefit plans, the actuarial cost charged to the income statement consists of current service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and past service cost.
The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance income and expenses, the remaining service cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full immediately through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payments The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees.
The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse.
The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise.
The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.
Share capital Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs.
Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid.
They are classified as own shares within equity.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.
Restatement of prior periods for finalisation of fair values arising on acquisitions The fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
All fair value adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and, consequently, may result in the restatement of previously reported financial results.

Significant accounting policies continued Recent accounting developments The following EU-endorsed new, revised and amended published standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2010 and have been adopted: IFRS 3 revised, Business Combinations and amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with some significant changes.
For example, all acquisition-related costs are expensed, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments subsequently re-measured at fair value through the income statement.
There are also changes to the reporting of non-controlling interest.
The change has been applied prospectively.
The improvements include changes to finance leases and financial instrument disclosures.
These consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the revised disclosure requirements.
The following EU-endorsed amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2010 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Groups financial statements: Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment: Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation: Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers: and Management Commentary practice statement.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group when they become applicable in future periods: IAS 24 revised, Related Party Transactions: Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, subject to EU endorsement: Amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes, subject to EU endorsement: Amendment to IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction: and IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
The impact of adopting the following new and improved published standards when they become effective in future periods, but were in issue at the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, is under assessment: IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, subject to EU endorsement: IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement: and Improvements to IFRSs 2010.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of management judgement required in their application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for the Group.
The level of management judgement required includes assumptions and estimates about future events which are uncertain, the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from that anticipated.
Revenue and profit recognition The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources required and other factors.
This process is carried out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work.
No profit is recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated.
Business combinations Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
This process is reliant on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its cash-generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered.
The Group additionally reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Further details on the sensitivity of the carrying value of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 11.
60 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Consolidation of US subsidiaries As described on page 35, the Group and the US DoD have entered into a proxy agreement that regulates the ownership, management and operation of the Groups 100% owned subsidiary, QinetiQ North America, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Having considered the terms of the proxy agreement, the Directors consider that the Group has control over the operating and financial policies of QinetiQ North America and, therefore, consolidates the subsidiaries in the consolidated accounts.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality, inflation and future salary and pension increases.
Management exercise their best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group.
Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the deficit or the net income statement costs.
Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the retirement benefit obligation recognised.
Further details on these assumptions are set out in note 39.
Research and development expenditure Internally-funded development expenditure is capitalised when criteria are met and is written off over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
Management decides upon the adequacy of future demand and potential market for such new products in order to justify capitalisation of internally-funded development expenditure.
These can be difficult to determine when dealing with innovative technologies.
Actual product sales may differ from these estimates.
Tax In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.

The gain in respect of negative goodwill on acquisitions in the period relates to the acquisition of Sensoptics Ltd on 16 December 2010 as described in note 13.
The gain in respect of deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions is the result of conditions for the deferred consideration in respect of the Cyveillance, Inc acquisition not being met.
The prior year gain on business divestments relates to the disposal of two businesses.
On 30 September 2009 the Group disposed of the Underwater Systems business, a division of QinetiQ Limited, to Atlas Elektronik UK Limited for a consideration before costs of 23.5m which resulted in a profit on disposal of 6.9m.

The rate on this credit is low as the majority of items do not attract tax relief in the current period.
Factors affecting future tax charges The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development relief in the UK.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any future tax legislation changes and the geographical mix of profits.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had unused tax losses of 188.7m 2010: 117.1m potentially available for offset against future profits.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 33.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.
Underlying basic earnings per share figures are presented below, in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share as the directors consider this gives a more relevant indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the impact of specific non-recurring items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and tax thereon.

Goodwill at 31 March 2011 was allocated across six cash generating units CGUs.
In the year two CGUs in the US Services business were amalgamated into one to reflect the way in which these businesses are managed and operated.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two year period.
Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the second year of the two year plan, with a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0%-3.0% 2010: 1.5%-2.5%.
Growth rates are formed based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer-term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for risks specific to the geographical location of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
The pre-tax discount rate applied for US CGUs was 11.8% 2010: 11.8%-12.1% and a range from 11.1%-19.0% for UK and Australia CGUs 2010: 9.3%-16.9%.
70 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Significant CGUs Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key variables impacting on the outcome of the recoverable amount.
The US Services CGU has headroom, with current assumptions, of 73.3m.
If the discount rate assumption was increased by 1% then the CGU would require an impairment of 16.2m.
Sensitivity analysis shows that an decrease or increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate could result in an impairment of 5.8m or headroom of 190.1m, respectively.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 369.9m.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the US has significant headroom.
An increase in either the WACC rate or decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 115.3m.
Within UK Services the individual CGUs have significant headroom.
An increase in the WACC rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for these CGUs as at 31 March was 27.6m.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the UK has headroom, under current assumptions, of 43.4m.
If the discount rate was to increase by 1%, or the terminal growth rate decrease by 1%, this would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 5.8m.
The Australia CGU has headroom, under current assumptions, of 1.1m.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 2.5m.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions since 31 March 2011 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

On 16 December 2010, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Sensoptics Limited from its founder management team.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been 1,705.0m and the Group profit before tax would have been 27.3m.

Sensoptics Limited was acquired to combine its technology with QinetiQs OptaSense signal processing capabilities.
The OptaSense solution provides cost-effective around-the-clock distributed acoustic monitoring over long distances.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination relate to the intellectual property embodied within the Sensoptics Limited existing products and products under development.
Total expected payments are in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired.
However, certain potential payments are linked to continuing employment assumptions for the retained founder management team, which would be forfeited in full should they leave within the stipulated period.
Under IFRS 3 revised this type of arrangement is required to be accounted for as remuneration expense as opposed to part of the consideration.
As a result, the acquisition resulted in negative goodwill of 0.2m, which was recognised as a gain in the consolidated income statement within gain loss on business combinations and divestments and unrealised impairment of investments.
The discounted fair value of the deferred contingent purchase price payments treated as remuneration was 6.1m and this was charged to the consolidated income statement within operating costs significant non-recurring items.
Acquisition-related costs included within other operating costs excluding depreciation and amortisation amount to 0.2m.

Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board, setting out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives.
Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
A Fair values of financial instruments The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices including those within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2011. note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Current other investments 20 2.3 2.3 Non-current other investments 17 4.8 4.8 Liabilities Current derivative financial instruments 26 0.4 0.4 Total 2.3 0.4 4.8 6.7 For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk.
For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available.
Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value.

The Groups current policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30-80% of the level of borrowings, achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
Where there are significant changes in level and or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board review of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.
At 31 March 2011 99% 2010: 98% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates with no adjustment for interest rate swaps at 31 March 2011.

Financial risk management continued C Currency risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Groups transactional hedge contracts.
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.
Functional currency of the operating company Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities all figures in millions US dollar Euro Australian dollar Other Total 31 March 2011 sterling 15.5 2.7 6.4 1.1 20.3 31 March 2010 sterling 5.1 1.4 4.1 0.4 11.0 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs.
The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2011 against sterling are net US dollars sold 5.4m US$8.3m and net Euros sold of 12.8m 14.3m.
Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost of such hedging activity is uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group had one 6m currency loan and one A$1.5m currency loan as net investment hedges in year, both were repaid before 31 March 2011.
D Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AAor equivalent.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals 121.9m 2010: 80.2m.
The Group held cash and cash equivalents of 102.5m at 31 March 2011 2010: 63.9m, which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets.
The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which are rated AA or better.

The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2011, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2011, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

For the 2003 Share Option Scheme, there was a pre-bonus issue weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options.
Prior to IPO in February 2006, there was no active market for the Companys shares, therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
At this time the Group had no established pattern of dividend payments therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.

Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 56.7m at 31 March 2011 31 March 2010: 55.1m in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the MOD and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Group's insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the arrangements referred to in note 36, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.

Post-retirement benefits Triennial funding valuation The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2008 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 111.3m.
On the basis of this full valuation, the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed the employer contribution rate of 11.5% from 30 June 2008, and past service deficit recovery payments of 13m per year for a ten-year period from this date.
The next scheduled triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2011.
Introduction and background to IAS 19 International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date.
It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries.
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees.
The Defined Benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes which are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
On 31 March 2009, the Group withdrew from the Public Sector Transfer Club.
The Defined Contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
The Company closed the DC section from 31 March 2011 and has replaced this with a Group Personal Pension Plan managed by Zurich.
All existing DC members will be automatically transferred to the GPP Plan.
The DC Section will be wound up by the Trustees in due course.
The expected employer cash contribution to the defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 March 2012 is 32.5m 2011: 36.6m, subject to the outcome of the next triennial valuation in June 2011.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2011 amounted to nil 31 March 2010: 0.2m.
QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date March 2010: nil.
Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes liabilities.
The fair value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: all figures in million 2011 2010 2009 2008 Equities 564.1 714.6 473.7 620.8 Corporate bonds 158.7 69.5 78.4 83.9 Government bonds 165.3 69.6 83.2 76.3 Property 78.0 53.4 Other 15.0 8.8 12.1 3.2 Total market value of assets 981.1 915.9 647.4 784.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,105.7 1,063.2 752.6 807.6 Net pension liability before deferred tax 124.6 147.3 105.2 23.4 Deferred tax asset 32.4 41.2 29.4 6.5 Net pension liability 92.2 106.1 75.8 16.9 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 99 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 39.

100 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2011 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.6% 3.6% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.6% 5.6% RPI inflation assumption 3.6% 3.6% CPI inflation assumption 2.7% N A Assumed life expectancies in years Future male pensioners currently aged 60 88 87 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 90 89 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 90 89 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 91 90 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators.
The life expectancy assumptions for mortality have increased in the year to 31 March 2011 with the base tables for mortality in line with the Medium Cohort projections with minimum annual rates of improvement of 1.25% for males and 0.75% for females 2010: improvement 1% for males and 0.5% for females.
The current mortality rates reflect the standard tables PNMA00MC for males and PNFA00MC for females for members year of birth.
These mortality tables are published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 24.1m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 24.5m Salary increase Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 5.8m Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 22.2m Scheme assets The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon the expected return rates for each asset class.
Equity return rates are the long-term expected return rates based upon the market rates of return for risk-free investments, typically government bonds, together with the historical level of risk premium associated with equities: with the resulting rate then being reviewed and benchmarked against a peer group of listed companies.
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets weighted to reflect the individual scheme actual asset allocations were: 2011 2010 Equities 8.0% 8.0% Corporate bonds 5.5% 5.5% Government bonds 4.3% 4.4% Property 8.0% 8.5% Cash 4.3% 4.3% Weighted average 6.9% 7.5% Return on scheme assets all figures in million 2011 2010 Actual return on plan assets: Expected return on scheme assets 68.6 46.3 Actuarial loss gain on scheme assets 14.0 206.6 Actual gain on scheme assets 54.6 252.9 Defined contribution schemes Payments to the defined contribution schemes totalled 24.1m March 2010: 24.6m.
