86 Inc hcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.
The principal schemes are held in the UK and are final salary defined benefit pension schemes.
Most of the schemes have assets held in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas defined benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
a. UK schemes The UK has four main defined benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes are considered below: Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The majority of the schemes liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of equities and gilts.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2009 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Whilst a majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benefits and the investment strategy reflects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities and bonds.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2010 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and the majority of the assets are invested in bonds, cash or gilts.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 5.0m 2010 4.8m.
There are no outstanding contributions to the defined contribution schemes at the year end 2010 nil.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported below.
The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were: United Kingdom Overseas 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 4.9 4.9 4.5 Rate of increase in pensions 3.0 3.4 Discount rate 4.7 5.4 2.7 3.2 Rate of inflation: Retail price index 3.0 3.4 0.4 0.2 Consumer price index 2.3 n a n a n a Expected return on plan assets 5.2 6.1 7.0 6.1 www.
com 87 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirements benefits continued The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 5.2% 2010 6.0% per annum.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 22.9 years 2010 22.6 years for current pensioners and 25.3 years 2010 25.0 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities, bonds and diversified growth funds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities, expected yields on bonds and expected returns on the diversified growth funds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.
The asset liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position is determined as follows: United Kingdom Overseas Total 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 837.3 824.8 44.0 37.1 881.3 861.9 Fair value of plan assets 906.5 841.6 35.9 38.1 942.4 879.7 Surplus deficit in funded obligations 69.2 16.8 8.1 1.0 61.1 17.8 Irrecoverable element of pension surplus 72.9 36.2 0.4 0.4 73.3 36.6 Net deficit surplus in funded obligations 3.7 19.4 8.5 0.6 12.2 18.8 Present value of unfunded obligations 1.2 1.3 1.5 2.1 2.7 3.4 4.9 20.7 10.0 1.5 14.9 22.2 The net pension asset liability is analysed as follows: Schemes in surplus 47.0 21.2 0.3 0.8 47.3 22.0 Schemes in deficit 51.9 41.9 10.3 2.3 62.2 44.2 4.9 20.7 10.0 1.5 14.9 22.2 The amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement are as follows: United Kingdom Overseas Total 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m m m Current service cost 5.1 5.2 2.1 2.1 7.2 7.3 Interest expense on plan liabilities 42.5 45.2 1.2 1.0 43.7 46.2 Expected return on plan assets 42.8 44.5 2.3 2.4 45.1 46.9 Plan settlements 6.1 6.1 1.3 5.9 1.0 0.7 0.3 6.6 The actual gain on plan assets amounts to 94.1m 2010 119.7m.

Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
This may be at country, regional or brand level.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segments: 2011 2010 m m United Kingdom 262.3 262.3 Russia and Emerging Markets 210.0 219.8 South Asia 20.2 20.3 Australasia 9.8 9.7 502.3 512.1 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2011.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth decline, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
These growth rates reflect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The growth rates used vary between 1% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate assumptions are based on an estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 12%, and reflect long-term country risk.
The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Discount rate Long-term growth rate United Kingdom 10% 2% Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 12% 5% South Asia 10% 1% Australasia 12% 1% Impairment An impairment charge of 5.5m was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2010 in relation to sites in the UK and Australia that were sold or closed.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long-term growth rates.
With the exception of the Musa Motors group in Russia and the Groups business in Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the other CGUs.

A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would reduce the headroom available to approximately 10% of the carrying value.
The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 5%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the headroom available.

To meet this requirement, management purchases and sells bonds regularly and does not usually hold the bonds to maturity.
Accordingly, the maturity profile of the bonds is not necessarily an indication of when management intends to realise the associated future cash flows.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the bonds classified as available for sale.

The asset is not recognised, as 144m 2010 132m relates to losses which exist within legal entities that are not forecast to generate taxable income with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax asset of 8.5m 2010 7.3m relates to trading losses in Russia 4.6m, Belgium 2.9m and other territories 1.0m where future profits are anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 33m 2010 36m relating to capital losses.
The asset represents 131m 2010 134m of losses at the UK standard rate of 25.0%.
The key territory holding the losses is the UK.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The vast majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost.
There are a small number of territories that do not qualify for this treatment but the annual profits for these territories are self assessed for UK current tax each year and hence no deferred tax accrues.
If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate effect, no tax charge 2010 nil would be payable.
The 12.7m 2010 9.0m deferred tax liability for provisions and other timing differences consists of a 32.0m 2010 31.0m liability in respect of the net book value of property, plant and equipment that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations, and a 19.3m 2010 22.0m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base.

Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to Sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
c. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2011 the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings.

com 107 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued d. Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated Financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedging Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on foreign currency earnings.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.

Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.

2 Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to Group policy.
3 Counterparties in certain markets in which the Group operates do not have a credit rating.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 385.6m 2010 376.5m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Groups broad customer base.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
Title to the vehicles sold on finance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received from the finance house in respect of a given vehicle.
com 109 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued f. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.

Hedging activities In accordance with IFRS 7 disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

com 111 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2011 was 520.1m 2010 637.5m.

Fair value hedge At 31 December 2011, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year loan notes.
Under these swaps the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays LIBOR 85bps and LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after debt reduction in 2009 to offset the non-required portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
h. Capital management The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
