Deferred income tax continued The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows: Accelerated capital Tax Share allowances Provisions losses Pension Hedging options Intangibles Total Deferred tax assets liabilities m m m m m m m m At 1 January 2010 10.8 22.2 10.2 0.2 2.1 0.6 0.9 23.2 Charged credited to the income statement 2.8 0.9 2.2 0.1 0.9 0.7 1.8 Credited directly to other comphrehensive income 1.2 1.2 Exchange differences 2.1 0.3 2.1 0.1 0.2 At 31 December 2010 15.7 23.4 14.5 0.3 2.1 2.7 0.3 26.4 Deferred tax asset 0.5 23.4 14.5 2.1 2.7 43.2 Deferred tax liability 16.2 0.3 0.3 16.8 At 31 December 2010 15.7 23.4 14.5 0.3 2.1 2.7 0.3 26.4 Accelerated capital Tax Share allowances Provisions losses Pension Hedging options Intangibles Total Deferred tax assets liabilities m m m m m m m m At 1 January 2011 15.7 23.4 14.5 0.3 2.1 2.7 0.3 26.4 Charged credited to the income statement 1.0 5.5 5.3 0.2 0.6 0.2 1.8 Credited directly to other comphrehensive income 0.7 0.7 Exchange differences 0.1 0.2 0.1 At 31 December 2011 16.8 17.9 20.0 0.6 1.4 2.8 0.1 24.6 Deferred tax asset 1.0 19.1 20.0 1.4 2.8 44.3 Deferred tax liability 17.8 1.2 0.6 0.1 19.7 At 31 December 2011 16.8 17.9 20.0 0.6 1.4 2.8 0.1 24.6 Deferred taxation has not been provided in the event of the distribution of the unappropriated profits or reserves of certain overseas subsidiary undertakings as the Group does not currently intend to make such distributions.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 6.3 million 2010: 6.4 million available for offset against future profits, subject to agreement with the tax authorities.
The losses carried forward are in certain entities and can only be utilised against future profits of those entities.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as there is uncertainty in respect of its future recoverability.
In particular, 3.8 million 2010: 3.8 million of the balance relates to losses arising in the Australian consolidated group which are subject to strict recognition rules.
The Group is still determining whether the losses can be recognised and if so, the extent to which they can be recognised.
Advance corporation tax written off to date amounts to 1.5 million 2010: 1.8 million and is available for offset against future United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities subject to certain conditions being met.
The future benefit of advance corporation tax has not been accounted for in the provision of deferred taxation as its recoverability is not probable.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
Legislation was passed in the Finance Act 2011 to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 25% as from 1 April 2011.
The deferred tax balances in these financial statements have therefore been measured at 25%.
However, in the March 2012 Budget Statement an additional announcement was made advising that the main rate of corporation tax will be reduced from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012.
This change was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 through the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 and is expected to be passed through the Finance Act 2012.
Had the new corporate tax rate been adopted, the deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2011 would reduce by 0.9 million.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and have therefore not been included in the financial statements.
