Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 continued 3. significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates continued c Trading properties continued If the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based their valuation prove to be false, this may have an impact on the net realisable value of the Groups properties, which would in turn have an effect on the Groups financial condition.
d Trade receivables The Group is required to judge when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade receivables.
It does this on the basis of the age of the relevant receivables, external evidence of the credit status of the counterparty and the status of any disputed amounts.
e Valuation of interest-rate swaps The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
f Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust REIT taxation regime On 1 January 2007 the Group converted to a group REIT.
In order to achieve and retain group REIT status, several entrance tests had to be met and certain on-going criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the notional taxable profit of the property rental business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a group REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business.
Segmental information Management has determined the Groups operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Senior Management Board SMB, which consists of the four Executive Directors, to make strategic decisions.
All the Groups operations are in the UK and are organised into two business segments against which the Group reports its segmental information, being Retail Portfolio and London Portfolio.
The London Portfolio includes all our London ofces and central London retail excluding assets held in the Metro Shopping Fund Limited Partnership joint venture and the Retail Portfolio includes all our shopping centres, shops, retail warehouse properties, Brand Empire, the Accor hotel portfolio and assets held in retail joint ventures, excluding central London retail.
The information and reports reviewed by the SMB are prepared on a combined portfolio basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures on a proportionately consolidated basis and, as such, the following segmental information has been prepared and presented on a proportionately consolidated basis.
The Groups primary measure of underlying profit before tax is Revenue profit.
This measure seeks to show the profit arising from ongoing operations and as such removes all items of a capital nature e. g. valuation movements and profit loss on disposal of investment properties and one-off or exceptional items.
Segment profit is the lowest level to which the profit arising from the on-going operations of the Group is analysed between the two segments.
The Group manages its nancing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and interest charges are not specic to a particular segment.
