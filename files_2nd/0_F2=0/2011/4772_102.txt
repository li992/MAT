The Board comprises eight Directors and the Non Executive Chairman.
There are the same number of independent NonExecutive Directors and Executive Directors which the Board consider to be an appropriate and effective combination.
The Board also considers that four Executive Directors are sufficient to manage a Company of this size and organisational structure and they have all confirmed that they are able to devote sufficient time to their roles.

The Chief Executive is responsible for: Operational management and control of the Group on a daytoday basis, local operational decisions are the responsibility of the local managers, who are accountable to the Chief Executive and other Board members: Formulating and proposing strategy to the Board: and Implementing the strategy and policies adopted by the Board.

A formal ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group exists.
This process was in place at the date of approval of the Annual Report and is in accordance with the Code and the Turnbull Guidance.
Internal controls are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Internal Audit completes a programme of work each year that provides assurance that the internal controls they have tested are working effectively and also propose improvements where appropriate and necessary.
Coupled with this, the biannual review of the Risk Register provides a further formal review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls.
All such work is reported to and monitored by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, as part of an ongoing process, has formally reviewed and continues to keep under review the effectiveness of the Groups systems of internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
The Audit Committee reviews risk management annually and receives reports from executive management regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of weaknesses in internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal control.
There have been no reports of system weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows: Financial reporting The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting.
The Groups monthly actual results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated with revised forecasts prepared as necessary.
Operational management receives comprehensive management accounts covering their areas of responsibility, which forms the basis for the consolidated accounts: Financial controls The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and procedures to be employed by operational management.
Key controls over major business risks include reviews against budgets and forecasts, review against key performance indicators and exception reporting: Quality and integrity of personnel One of the Groups core values is integrity.
This is regarded as vital to the maintenance of the Groups system of internal financial control.
The Directors have put in place an organisation structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority where the Board considers it necessary and appropriate: Internal audit The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Chief Executive and the Audit Committee.
It coordinates the completion of selfassessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control weakness or exposure.

In addition, regular meetings between Internal Audit and the external auditors,  LLP, were held during the year to discuss and plan audit work and to ensure a complementary approach.
The Head of Internal Audit provides reports to the Audit Committee at every meeting: Procedures The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its operations, both client facing and in support departments.
These provide clear guidance on the correct or most appropriate course of action in various circumstances.
Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have been identified.
Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such processes and procedures.
A comprehensive review of procedures and training commenced during 2008 and is ongoing: and Risk assessment Management has responsibility for the identification and evaluation of significant risks that might arise in their area of responsibility together with the design of suitable internal controls.
The Executive Directors and the wider management team continually assess the risks.
A Risk Register is maintained, which is formally presented to and reviewed by the Audit Committee twice a year.
These procedures are designed to, amongst other things, help to provide assurance around the process of preparing consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting system.
An explanation of how the Group creates and preserves value and the strategy for delivering its objectives is included in the Business Review section on pages 8 to 13.
Nomination Committee Peter Hindley, the Chairman, chaired the Nomination Committee during 2011, which met on two occasions during the year.
The other members of the Committee are James Newman, Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
The Committee regularly reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and the senior management team.
It is also responsible for identifying and nominating, for the approval of the Board, replacement or additional Directors and members of the senior management team.
Such appointments would be preceded by the preparation, by the Committee, of a role description and capabilities.
The Committee was actively involved in the identification and appointment of the new NonExecutive Directors, Martin Pexton and Jane Ashcroft.
The Nomination Committee and by extension the Board strongly supports the spirit of Lord Davies Report Women on Boards and will work towards a goal of 20 per cent of board positions filled by women by 2015.
To facilitate achievement of this aspiration, as retiring Directors are replaced, the Committee will ensure that our executive search agents include the strongest possible field of female candidates.
We will however remain mindful of the overall need to recruit the very best candidates regardless of gender.
The Board will continue to encourage similar diversity in senior management positions and throughout the workforce.
