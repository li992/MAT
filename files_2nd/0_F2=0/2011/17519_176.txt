Dividends paid and proposed The Group previously acquired the right to market to third parties various leading technologies for the mining, mineral processing and metals extraction 151 industries, in a business combination.
The technology patents are amortised over their useful economic lives of 20 years to June 2023.
2011 The Group previously acquired hydroelectricity rights which will be amortised over the expected life of the operation, currently estimated as being 40 years, 586 following commissioning.
381 A long-term feed contract is being amortised over an eight-year period.
967 Other intangible assets mainly comprise computer software and software development that are being amortised over their useful economic lives of between three to five years.
Impairment testing Goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs no larger than the reportable segments that are expected to benefit from the related acquisitions.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
This is usually considered a single operation or in some cases a number of operations that are in close geographical proximity or 14.
Intangible assets share operational efficiencies.
The carrying values of goodwill by CGU are as follows: Hydro Export Technology Feed electricity 2011 2010 US$m rights Goodwill patents contract rights Other 2011 Alloys Africa 40 49 1,017 6,505 54 197 501 126 8,400 Copper Americas 1,185 1,185 81 39 120 Zinc Lead 1,546 1,546 31 31 Zinc Lead Europe 195 203 18 4 40 37 99 2,966 2,983 16 16 The following goodwill balances result from the requirement on an acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax 156 91 7 240 effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
For the purposes of testing this goodwill for impairment, any of the related 843 6,495 50 173 501 166 8,228 deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition that remain at balance date are treated as part of the relevant CGU or group of CGUs.
The Group performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and at the reporting date if there are indicators of impairment.
The most recent test was undertaken at 31 October 2011 and, for any assets where additional indicators of impairment were identified in November or December, testing was updated at 31 December 2011.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU or reportable segment is compared with its recoverable amount.
The goodwill impairment expense recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement refer to note 10 relates to the following: Impairment method 2011 2010 US$m Nickel Americas South FVLCS 201 201 For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing in 2010 and 2011, recoverable amounts were determined based on fair value less costs to sell FVLCS calculations, with the exception of Coal Australia goodwill, Coal Americas South goodwill and Chrome Africa goodwill which were based on value-in-use VIU calculations.
Where observable market prices are not available, FVLCS was calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking account of assumptions that would be made by market participants.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 152 15.
Impairment testing continued VIU is based on the cash flows expected to be generated from mines, smelting and refining operations included within the CGUs or reportable segments.
Cash flows are projected for periods up to the date that mining and refining are expected to cease, based on managements expectations at the time of completing the testing.
This date depends on a number of variables, including recoverable reserves and resources, the forecast selling prices for such production and the treatment charges received from the refining operations.
Cash flows have been projected for a maximum of 45 years 2010: 30 years.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations and in determining the FVLCS are: recoverable reserves and resources: commodity prices: operating costs: treatment charges receivable by smelting and refining operations: capital expenditure: discount rates: and foreign exchange rates.
Economically recoverable reserves and resources represent managements expectations at the time of completing the impairment testing, based on reserves and resource statements and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by appropriately qualified persons.
A summary of the mineral resources and ore reserves is published on the Xstrata plc website.
Long-term commodity prices and treatment charges are determined by reference to external market forecasts.
Specific prices are determined using information available in the market after considering the nature of the commodity produced and long-term market expectations.
Forecast prices vary in accordance with the year the sale is expected to occur.
The commodity prices used in the impairment review are management estimates and are within the range of the available analyst forecasts at 31 October 2011 and 31 December 2011.
The attributable value to reserves and resources using the FVLCS method is based on managements best estimates using market-based forecasts and 2011 information available in the market.
7,250 15% 5% 75% Operating cost assumptions are based on managements best estimate at the date of impairment testing of the costs to be incurred.
Costs are 2,116 11% 2% 16% determined after considering current operating costs, future cost expectations and the nature and location of the operation.
Smelting and refining treatment charges vary in accordance with the commodity prices and time of processing.
Future capital expenditure is based on managements best estimate of required future capital requirements, which generally is for the extraction of existing reserves and resources.
It has been determined by taking into account all committed and anticipated capital expenditure adjusted for future cost estimates.
The discount rates that have been used are outlined below.
In the case of FVLCS they represent real after-tax rates, whereas the VIU discount rates represent 2010 real pre-tax rates.
These rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital specific to each CGU or reportable segment and the currency of the cash flows generated.
The weighted average cost of capital reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money, equity market volatility and the risks specific to the CGU or reportable segment for which cash flows have not already been adjusted.
These rates were calculated with reference to market information from third party advisers.

method 2011 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions FVLCS 392 A significant amount of commodity price and foreign exchange volatility continues to exist in the market.
Adverse changes in key assumptions as described FVLCS below could result in changes to impairment charges specifically in relation to Coppers Americas and Zinc Lead.

Impairment testing A summary of the mineral resources and ore reserves related to the goodwill balances, released in January 2010, is summarised as follows: 153 Reserves Resources Proved Probable Measured Indicated Inferred Million tonnes Copper Americas 1,318 3,283 2,045 6,184 7,246 Zinc Lead 98 81 335 245 238 Commodity prices commodity price forecasts were based on external market consensus information.
The copper prices ranged from US$2.62 per pound to US$3.30 per pound 2010 US$2.14 per pound to US$3.76 per pound, US$0.90 per pound to US$0.98 per pound 2010 US$0.98 per pound to US$1.11 per pound for zinc and US$0.92 per pound to US$0.93 per pound 2010 US$0.79 per pound to US$1.11 per pound for lead, varying in accordance with the year the sale was expected to occur.
Treatment charges received from smelting and refining in performing the FVLCS calculation for Zinc Lead, treatment charges were estimated to be in the range of US$218 per tonne to US$230 per tonne 2010 US$231 per tonne to US$275 per tonne for zinc and US$132 per tonne to US$142 per tonne 2010 US$105 per tonne to US$127 per tonne for lead refining fees, based on the year of processing.
As outlined above, these prices were based on external market consensus information.
Foreign exchange rates foreign exchange rates used were based on external market consensus information.
The impairment tests are particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, discount rates and foreign exchange rates.
Changes to these assumptions could have resulted in changes to impairment charges.
The table below summarises the change required to key assumptions that would result in the carrying value equalling the recoverable values: Change in the key assumption that would Excess of result in the recoverable amount equalling recoverable the carrying value % amount over carrying value Commodity Discount Foreign US$m prices rate exchange rate 2011 Copper Americas 7,250 15% 5% 75% Zinc Lead 2,116 11% 2% 16% Amounts relate to absolute movement in discount rate.
