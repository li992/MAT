Financial risk management 26 a Fair value of financial instruments i Hierarchy of fair value The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The levels are as follows: Level 1: derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: derived from other observable market data for the assets or liabilities: and Level 3: derived from valuation techniques using data that is not based on observable market data.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2011, are considered to fall into Level 2.
The Group held the following financial instruments which fall within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement at 31 December: Carrying amount Comparison Carrying amount Comparison measurement basis fair value measurement basis fair value Fair value Fair value Amortised hierarchy Amortised hierarchy cost Level 2 cost Level 2 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 m m m m m m Loans and receivables: Trade receivables note 19 609.0 609.0 579.4 579.4 Derivative financial assets: Derivative financial instruments: non-current 2.0 3.5 Derivative financial instruments: current 7.6 3.9 Financial liabilities at amortised cost: Trade payables note 25 217.7 217.7 203.8 203.8 Loans note 22 842.8 865.0 514.1 532.1 Derivative financial liabilities: Derivative financial instruments: current 12.3 2.4 Derivative financial instruments: non-current 26.3 5.2 The Directors estimate that the carrying amounts of trade receivables and trade payables approximate to their fair value.
The fair values of loans are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate associated with the loan.
All loans are held at amortised cost.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate quoted interest rates for the duration of the instruments as noted below: Currency swaps and interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The present value of foreign currency balances are converted at the year end exchange rate: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates matching the maturities of the contracts: and Commodity contracts are measured at the present value of estimated cash flows with reference to quoted forward prices for Gas Oil.
