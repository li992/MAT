The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
The directors consider the following potential key areas of judgement required to be made in applying the Groups accounting policies: the determination of the revenue recognition approach to apply to individual contracts: the classification of retirement benefit plans between defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements: the classification of financial assets or liabilities: the classification of investments as subsidiaries, equity accounted investments or otherwise: and the determination of assumptions underpinning goodwill impairment testing.
The directors do not consider that the practical application of the judgements is significantly uncertain or subjective in nature.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 32.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
There were no changes in these accounting policies in the year.
An explanation of the critical accounting estimates and judgements used in producing these consolidated financial statements is made in the Directors report on page 54.
Consolidation The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures results accounted for under the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 December.
Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to govern the operating and financial policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Prior to the disposal of the Regional Aircraft Asset Management business, subsidiaries included the special purpose entities that the Group transacted through for the provision of guarantees in respect of residual values, and head lease and finance payments on certain regional aircraft sold.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Equity accounted investments An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the consolidated income statement includes its share of their profits and losses, and the consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
