there were no indications that would require the Group to Equity accounting of associate permanently discontinue the exploration programme and the At 31 December 2011, the Group owned 26.0% of ENRC PLC, Group remained committed to the project with approval for a Kazakhstan-based mining company listed on the London further capital expenditure included in the 2011 Group budget.
Based on the above considerations, the Directors concluded that The investment has been recorded as an associate and accounted no impairment indicators existed in relation to the exploration and for under the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 Investments evaluation assets of Kazakhmys Petroleum at 31 December 2010. in Associates.
IAS 28 states that there is a rebuttable presumption that significant influence exists where an investor holds more than Following drilling results received at the end of June 2011, and the 20% of the voting power of the investee.
Although Kazakhmys does receipt of an offer to purchase the Petroleum business in July 2011, not have representation on the board of ENRC, the Directors believe the Directors performed an impairment review of Kazakhmys that the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence by Petroleum.
The net expected proceeds from the disposal of virtue of its substantial shareholding, whereby the Group owns in $100 million plus contingent consideration in the form of potential excess of 25% of the issued share capital of ENRC and is the single royalties of up to $476 million, dependent upon future oil revenues, largest shareholder.
was used to determine the recoverable amount, resulting in a $444 million impairment charge being recognised.
In determining This interest confers the Group with certain additional rights and the consideration receivable, no value has been assigned to the influence under the Companies Act 2006 CA06 which allows the contingent consideration given the inherent uncertainties in oil Group to block special resolutions proposed by ENRC at general exploration and the adverse drilling results which led to the assets meetings.
Consequentially, through the provisions of the CA06, impairment.
The sale and purchase agreement was signed on the Group is able to participate in policy making processes of ENRC, 24 August 2011 and the sale completed on 23 December 2011. including participation about distributions such as share buy-backs, Consequently, the business ceased to be consolidated with effect which form part of ENRCs capital management strategy.
from the disposal date and a loss on disposal of $24 million has been The Directors are of the view that the Group has influence over the realised in the Groups consolidated income statement for the year acquisition strategy of ENRC by having the ability to block related ended 31 December 2011, arising from the recycling of the foreign party transactions which ENRC have a history of making, where currency translation reserves which arose on conversion of the tenge these transactions are over and above the fide-minimis exemption denominated assets and liabilities of Kazakhmys Petroleum into in the Listing Rules.
Furthermore, the frequency and nature of meetings between the two Assets held for sale and discontinued operations companies have changed substantially since the Group increased its During 2009 the Directors decided to dispose of MKM given the shareholding above 25%, with matters such as acquisition strategy Groups strategy is to focus on natural resource opportunities in and the exchange of technical information regarding power the Central Asian region.
The business was classified as an asset held generation, taxation and mining safety being discussed.
for sale at 31 December 2009, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement for the 2009 financial In the Directors judgement, the Group has the ability to exercise year.
This classification was made as the Group believed that a sale significant influence over ENRC.
The Directors therefore believe that was highly probable to take place within 12 months from the date it remains appropriate for the Group to equity account for its interest the business was first classified as held-for-sale.
The sale of MKM in ENRC in accordance with IAS 28. has not completed within the envisaged 12 month period, as negotiations with potential acquirers have taken longer than was Exploration and evaluation expenditure originally anticipated, principally due to challenges faced by potential The Groups accounting policy for exploration and evaluation interested parties in raising the finance necessary to complete the expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised transaction.
The failure of the potential acquirers to secure the level for an area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable of funding required to meet MKMs working capital requirements is a by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached factor that was neither anticipated nor within managements control.
a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of As a result of the prolonged sales process, should a private sale not reserves.
This policy requires the Directors to make certain estimates complete in the near future, management will appoint an investment and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular bank to market the MKM business more internationally which would whether an economically viable extraction operation can be represent a change in the sales strategy as the previously internally established.
Any such estimates and assumptions may change as managed disposal process focussed on targeting potential European new information becomes available.
If, after having capitalised the acquirers only.
In addition, the Groups strategic objective of expenditure under this accounting policy, a judgement is made disposing of MKM remains the same, and discussions continue with that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised a number of interested parties at a price consistent with previous amount will be written off to the income statement.
Based on these facts, the Directors consider that MKM In the previous year, at 31 December 2010, the most significant continues to meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale at asset where the Directors applied their judgement in the area the balance sheet date, including, in particular, that a disposal is of exploration and evaluation expenditure related to Kazakhmys considered to be highly probable within the next 12 months.
Petroleum and the ongoing exploration and evaluation programme.
The Directors considered the following matters in reaching their judgement: although the exploration licence of Kazakhmys Petroleum expired in May 2011, the Directors were, at the time, of the opinion that the licence would be prolonged based on the positive discussions held Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 136 6 Determining the fair value of the Guarantee issued by the Impairment of assets Group to the China Development Bank CDB in respect of The Directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and Samruk-Kazyna intangible assets to determine whether there are any indicators of In 2010, the Group secured a $2.7 billion financing line with CDB and impairment such that the carrying values of the assets may not be Samruk-Kazyna, allocated from a $3.0 billion financing line agreed recoverable.
The assessment of whether an indicator of impairment between CDB and Samruk-Kazyna.
As part of this financing package, has arisen can require considerable judgement taking account of the Company, along with a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, provided a future operational and financial plans, commodity prices, sales guarantee in favour of CDB in respect of Samruk-Kazynas obligations demand and the competitive environment.
Where such indicators under its $3.0 billion financing line the Guarantee.
The Companys exist, the carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit is liability under the Guarantee is capped at $1.7 billion of principal plus compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the 85% of any interest and any other duly payable costs and expenses.
higher of net realisable value and value in use, which is determined An indemnity and netting-off agreement was entered into between on the basis of discounted future cash flows.
This involves the Company and Samruk-Kazyna ensuring that any payments made management estimates on commodity prices, market demand and under the Guarantee would be netted off against payments to be supply, economic and regulatory climates, long-term mine plans and made by Kazakhmys Finance PLC the principal borrower in the loan other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash flows due to changes agreements between Kazakhmys and Samruk-Kazyna under the loan in the above mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of agreements between it and Samruk-Kazyna.
In determining the fair value of the Guarantee in accordance with For the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the IAS 39, the right to net off payments made by the Company to the CDB most significant impairment charges related to businesses classified under the Guarantee against the balance payable by Kazakhmys as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, Finance PLC to Samruk-Kazyna under the financing line between these with impairment charges being recognised for Kazakhmys Petroleum parties is governed by English law, under which the Directors have $444 million 2010: $nil, MKM $9 million 2010: $58 million and the assumed the indemnity and netting-off agreement will be effective in Maikuben West coal mine $nil 2010: $12 million, each of which were the event of a default by Samruk-Kazyna under its financing line with written down to their recoverable amounts, represented by the fair the CDB.
The consequence of this assumption is the fair value of the value less costs to sell of each asset.
Guarantee is less than $5 million, an immaterial figure in the context At 31 December 2011, the carrying value of the Groups equity of a financing line available to the Group of $2.7 billion.
Should the investment in ENRC of $4,600 million exceeded the market value of indemnity and netting-off agreement not prove successful in a legal $3,289 million by an amount that the Directors deemed as significant or insolvency challenge in Kazakhstan, this would result in a potentially as envisaged by IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and larger liability as the Group would be required to fair value the full measurement.
As a result, an impairment review was performed in $1.7 billion exposure under the Guarantee.
accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, which concluded Determination of excess profits taxation that no impairment was necessary as the recoverable amount of Following the introduction of new tax legislation on 1 January 2009, the ENRC investment, being its value-in-use, exceeded the carrying the Directors interpreted the new tax legislation and the terms of value.
In determining the value-in-use of the ENRC investment, the the Groups subsoil licences and believed that excess profits tax was Directors made estimates of the future cash flows to be generated not applicable to the Groups operations after this date.

The results of the prior year and the period ended 23 December 2011 of Kazakhmys Petroleum are included within profit from discontinued operations see note 6 c. 6.
Discontinued operations and assets held-for-sale Discontinued operations consist of MKM see note 6 a, the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power plant for the period up to 26 February 2010 and the Maikuben West coal mine for the period up to 17 May 2011 within the Kazakhmys Power Division see note 6 b and Kazakhmys Petroleum for the period up to 23 December 2011, see note 6 c.

The business was classified as an asset held for sale at 31 December 2009, and correspondingly as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement for the 2009 financial year.
This classification was made as the Group believed that a sale was highly probable to take place within 12 months from the date the business was first classified as held-for-sale.
The sale of MKM has not completed within the envisaged 12 month period, as negotiations with potential acquirers have taken longer than was originally anticipated, principally due to challenges faced by potential interested parties in raising the finance necessary to complete the transaction.
The failure of the potential acquirers to secure the level of funding required to meet MKMs working capital requirements is a factor that was neither anticipated nor within managements control.
As a result of the prolonged sales process, should a private sale not complete in the near future, management will appoint an investment bank to market the MKM business more internationally which would represent a change in the sales strategy as the previously internally managed disposal process focussed on targeting potential European acquirers only.
In addition, the Groups strategic objective of disposing of MKM remains the same, and discussions continue with a number of interested parties at a price consistent with previous expectations.
The Directors, however, consider that MKM still meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date for the following reasons: x MKM is available for immediate sale and can be sold to a potential buyer in its current condition: x the Groups strategic objective of disposing of MKM remains the same and the Directors remain committed to the sales process: x an active marketing programme continues, with discussions being held with a number of interested parties for the purchase of the business at a price consistent with previous expectations, of which some of these parties have provided expressions of interest and have undertaken due diligence on MKM: and x a disposal within 12 months is considered to be highly probable.

Interest is payable on the drawn balance of the new facility at a rate of EURIBOR 2.25%.
The loan, consistent with the previous loan, is secured over the inventories and receivables of MKM.
The amount of inventories held as security for MKM borrowings is $95 million 2010: $200 million.
The amount of trade receivables held as security for MKM borrowings is $114 million 2010: $137 million.

Consequently, the results of discontinued operations only include the results of Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP for the period ended 26 February 2010.
Maikuben West coal mine On 17 May 2011 the Group sold the Maikuben West coal mine for a consideration of $3 million.

Segment information Information provided to the Groups Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of segmental performance is prepared in accordance with the management and operational structure of the Group.
For management and operational purposes, the Group is organised into four separate business units, as described below, according to the nature of their operations, end-products and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments.
Following the restructuring undertaken by the Group during 2011, the Groups operating segments have changed from those previously reported as at 31 December 2010.
Comparatives have been reclassified to align with the presentation for the period ending 31 December 2011.
The operating segments of the Group are: Kazakhmys Mining previously Kazakhmys Copper The Kazakhmys Mining business is managed as one operating segment and comprises all entities and functions within the Group responsible for the exploration, evaluation, development, mining and processing of the Groups mineral resources and sale of the Groups metal products.
The segment consists of: the Groups main operating entity, Kazakhmys LLC, whose principal activity is the mining and processing of copper and other metals which are produced as by-products: the Groups UK trading function, Kazakhmys Sales Limited, which is responsible for the purchase of exported products from Kazakhmys LLC and subsequently applies an appropriate mark-up prior to onward sale to third parties.
The UK entity is a sales function on behalf of the Kazakhmys Mining business and consequently the assets and liabilities related to those trading operations, i. e. trade payables and trade receivables, are included within the Kazakhmys Mining operating segment: the Groups exploration companies which provide services for greenfield drilling on new projects and deposits, brownfield drilling on expansion projects and deposits at existing mines, and exploration work for potential new projects and deposits for the Mining segment: the Groups project companies, whose function is principally the development of metal production related assets on behalf of the Mining segment involving the evaluation and development of the Groups mining projects: and the Groups technical and ancillary services which provide technical, logistics and other services principally to the Mining segment and which are managed as an extension of the Mining segment.
The financial and operating information used by the Board of Directors for the purpose of resource allocation of all these separate functions and entities are included within the Mining segment.
Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 150 6 Under the revised management and operating structure of the Group, Kazakhmys Gold, which was previously a separate segment, is now included within the Kazakhmys Mining segment.
The Groups captive power stations, which supply power to the Kazakhmys Mining segment and also externally to domestic customers, have been transferred to the Kazakhmys Power segment as these are now under the management of Kazakhmys Power and are reported to the Board of Directors as part of the Kazakhmys Power segment.
MKM MKM operates in Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy semi-finished products.
MKM faces different risks to the Groups other businesses, and produces different products, and is therefore shown as a separate operating segment.
As stated in note 6 a, the Directors have decided to dispose of MKM.
As a result, at 31 December 2011 and 2010, MKM has been classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation.
Kazakhmys Power Kazakhmys Power operates in Kazakhstan, and consists of the Groups captive power stations, the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power station joint venture and the Maikuben West coal mine up to the period ended 17 May 2011.
The principal activity of the Kazakhmys Power operating segment is the sale of electricity and coal to external customers and internally to the Kazakhmys Mining segment.
The captive power stations and the Groups 50% interest in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-fired power station are managed by the same management team and produce discrete financial and operating information that is used by the Board of Directors for operational and resource allocation decisions.
Kazakhmys Petroleum The Kazakhmys Petroleum business held a licence to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activity in the East Akzhar Exploration Block in western Kazakhstan.
As stated in note 6 c, the Group disposed of Kazakhmys Petroleum in December 2011, and as a result, it has been classified as a discontinued operation, and the comparative segment information has been restated accordingly.
Managing and measuring operating segments The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items.
Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business TFF note 10.
The Groups Treasury department monitors finance income and finance costs at the Group level on a net basis rather than on a gross basis at an operating segment level.
The accounting policies adopted by each operating segment are consistent with those published in note 3.
Inter-segment sales, which are transacted at cost, include power sales from Kazakhmys Power to Kazakhmys Mining from the Groups captive power stations, and coal sales from Kazakhmys Mining to the captive power stations within Kazakhmys Power from the Borly coal mine.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.

Corporate income tax is calculated at 26.5% 2010: 28.0% of the assessable profit for the year for the Company and its UK subsidiaries and 20.0% for the operating subsidiaries in Kazakhstan 2010: 20.0%.
MKM, which is included as part of discontinued operations, has a tax rate of 28.5% 2010: 28.5% which relates to German corporate income tax and trade tax.
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2011 is 13.6% 2010: 12.8%.
Kazakhstan corporate income tax CIT In 2010, new tax legislation was implemented such that the phased reduction in CIT, enacted in 2009, was removed and a flat rate of 20% would be maintained for future years.
Future tax charges are affected by the mix of profits and tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The lower CIT rate in Kazakhstan and the recognition of equity accounted earnings of ENRC and Ekibastuz GRES-1 on a post-tax basis will have the effect of significantly lowering the Groups overall future effective tax rate below the UK statutory corporate tax rate of 26%.
The following factors impact the Groups effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2011: Transfer pricing In June 2010, amendments to Kazakhstans transfer pricing legislation were passed into law and were made largely retrospective from 1 January 2009.
Under the new legislation, there is greater certainty over the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Following the amendments to the transfer pricing legislation, the Group amended the intercompany sale and purchase contracts between the UK and Kazakhstan to largely reflect the amended legislation.
Notwithstanding the revised intercompany sale and purchase contracts that were put in place and the amendments to the transfer pricing legislation, inconsistency still arises between the transfer pricing requirements in Kazakhstan and the UK.
Consequently, certain of the Groups profits are taxed in both jurisdictions which places upward pressure on the Groups effective tax rate.
Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 164 6 In addition, during 2010 and 2011, certain sales contracts entered into by Kazakhmys LLC with European and Russian customers included discounts applied to LME prices and quotation periods that were not fully acceptable under the amended Kazakhstan transfer pricing legislation and consequently, a provision was recognised of $3 million based on this anticipated exposure at 31 December 2011 2010: $9 million.
Non-deductible expenses Included within non-deductible expenses are the additional tax assessments and related fines and penalties, resulting from the completion of the tax audit conducted at Kazakhmys LLC for the years 2006 to 2008 inclusive in August 2011.
As a result, the Directors have made a provision for these additional tax assessments, which represents the Directors best estimate of the amounts that are expected to be paid to settle this potential liability.
The reversal of the provision for fines and penalties of $28 million relating to the release of the provision for excess profits tax refer below is non-taxable and offsets the upward pressure on the Groups effective tax rate arising from the non-deductible items relating to the tax audit.
Other non-deductible items relate to on-going business expenses and impairment losses at Kazakhmys Mining.
Excess profits taxation In August 2011, the tax authorities completed the audit of Kazakhmys LLC for the years 2006 and 2008 inclusive, with no additional claims being raised in respect of excess profits taxation EPT.
Subsequently, in October 2011 the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan issued a ruling that Kazakhmys LLC should not have been liable for excess profits tax in the periods up to and including 2008.
As a result of the completed tax audit, which confirmed the EPT methodology adopted by the company for the years 2006 to 2008, together with a previous tax audit for the years 2003 to 2005, along with the Supreme Courts ruling, the Directors believe that no further obligations exist in respect of EPT for the years 2003 to 2008.
As a result, the EPT provision of $21 million recognised in earlier years relating to the uncertainties over the judgements that were made in respect of Kazakhmys LLCs methodology of computing EPT in the periods up to and including 2008 has been released at 31 December 2011.
The total EPT provision recognised as at 31 December 2010 was $49 million, including $28 million related to fines and penalties.
Deferred tax asset on major social projects In 2011, the Group determined that the cost of constructing the major social projects in Kazakhstan will be deductible against taxable profits in the future as a result of amendments in the tax legislation which were introduced in January 2011.
The introduction of these amendments has resulted in the recognition of a $26 million deferred tax asset at 31 December 2011.
Equity accounting The Groups interest in the earnings of ENRC and Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP is included, net of tax, in the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before taxation, thereby reducing the Groups effective tax rate.
The following additional factors impacted the Groups effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2010 only: Non-deductible expenses Included within non-deductible expenses are amounts of $39 million in respect of social expenditure incurred within Kazakhmys LLC that were in excess of the threshold allowable for tax deductibility under Kazakhstan tax legislation.
Non-deductible interest The non-deductible interest of $6 million relates to interest on intercompany borrowings between the UK and Kazakhstan which are not deductible under UK tax legislation.
Unremitted overseas earnings Prior to August 2010, it was intended that unremitted earnings amounting to $1,463 million would be distributed from Kazakhmys LLC by way of dividend payments to settle an intercompany loan balance existing between Kazakhmys LLC and a UK subsidiary of the Group.
Following the completion of an internal restructuring programme at the end of August 2010, it was no longer expected that unremitted earnings within Kazakhmys LLC would be distributed by way of dividend as the intercompany loan balance was settled by alternative consideration.
Consequently, the withholding tax provision of $98 million previously recognised as at 31 December 2009 relating to the payment of dividends from Kazakhmys LLC, which were to be used as settlement of the intercompany loan, was released.

Under Kazakhstan tax legislation, tax losses from loss making subsoil use contracts may not be offset against the taxable profits of profitable subsoil use contracts.
Kazakhmys LLC expects that certain subsoil use contracts will be in a tax loss making position for the foreseeable future and will have no taxable profits against which the losses can be offset.
Therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax losses associated with these subsoil use contracts.
Tax losses arising from subsoil use contracts that are expected to be profitable in the future have been recognised as deferred tax assets.
ii Germany MKM has corporate income tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits, subject to restrictions set out under German tax legislation.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
Due to the past history of tax losses, there is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
d Unrecognised deferred tax liability The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of the Groups subsidiaries, as shown in their statutory accounts prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, are as follows: $ million 2011 2010 Undistributed reserves of subsidiaries 5,986 5,771 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 166 6 16.

On 6 April 2011, awards over 367,315 shares were granted with a 38 month vesting period.
Additional awards are due to be granted to senior management in April 2012 and these will be subject to the same vesting criteria as the awards granted on 6 April 2011.
The fair value of the shares was estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted.
This model simulates the TSR and compares it against the group of comparator companies.
It takes into account historic dividends and share price fluctuations to predict the distribution of relative share performance.
The following table shows the movements in the number of shares during the year: Number 2011 2010 Outstanding at 1 January 614,238 441,291 Granted on 9 April 2010 3 year vesting period 94,277 Granted on 17 May 2010 3 year vesting period 116,532 Granted on 6 April 2011 38 month vesting period 367,315 Lapsed on 31 December 66,202 37,862 Outstanding at 31 December 915,351 614,238 Exercisable at 31 December www.

On vesting of the award, the participants are entitled to cash equal to the value of dividends excluding the dividend tax credit that would have been paid on those shares between the grant date and the date of vesting.
Therefore, expected dividend yield does not affect the valuation of the awards and has been set at zero to achieve this effect.
Expected volatility is based on historic share price movements.
b Deferred Share Bonus Plan On 9 April 2010, awards over 31,499 shares were granted to employees based on an average share price at grant date of 15.80 with a two year vesting period.

The vesting of the options is dependent on the total shareholder return TSR of the Group as compared to a group of listed comparator companies, as well as a requirement for the recipients of options to remain in employment with the Company over the vesting period.
Options granted to the executive Directors and senior management under the ESOP will count towards the individual limits under the LTIP and will normally be subject to the same performance conditions as awards granted under the LTIP.
The first options were granted on 9 April 2010 over 11,388 shares with a three year vesting period and at an exercise price of 15.80.
No options were granted to executive Directors under the ESOP in 2010.
On 6 April 2011, an option over 2,122 shares was granted with a 38 month vesting period and at an exercise price of 14.14.
No options were granted to executive Directors under the ESOP in 2011.

As at 31 December 2010 and 2011, the facility was fully drawn.
The loan is secured on the value of copper sales contracts with certain designated customers.
Monthly loan repayments commenced in March 2009 and will continue through to February 2013 following a one year availability period.
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 31 December 2011 of $2 million 2010: $6 million, gross cost before amortisation of $26 million 2010: $26 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
Interest is payable on the drawn balance at a rate of US$ LIBOR plus 1.25%.
Kazakhmys PLC, Kazakhmys LLC and Kazakhmys Sales Limited act as guarantors of the loan.
The pre-export finance facility contains change of control clauses which are shown on page 123.
China Development Bank CDB and JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna Samruk-Kazyna financing line On 30 December 2009, Kazakhmys announced that it had secured a $2.7 billion financing line with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna, allocated from a $3.0 billion financing line agreed between CDB and Samruk-Kazyna.
Of the $2.7 billion secured for the Group, facility agreements were signed for $2.1 billion on 30 December 2009, and for a further $200 million on 12 January 2010, for the development of the Groups projects at Bozshakol and Bozymchak and other development projects, with the balance of $400 million remaining available over the next three years.
Samruk-Kazyna has separately signed an agreement for $300 million of the $3.0 billion to be used elsewhere and not for the benefit of the Group.
The funds are available for drawing any time within a three year period and once drawn will attract interest semi-annually at an annualised rate of US$ LIBOR plus 4.8%.
The loans have a final maturity of between 12 and 15 years from the first drawdown and repayment of principal commences from the end of the third year following the first drawdown under each facility.
As part of the financing package, the Company and JSC Kazakhtelecom Kazakhtel, a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, have provided a guarantee to CDB for a maximum of $2.0 billion of the $3.0 billion of loans made by CDB to Samruk-Kazyna the Guarantee.
The Companys liability under the Guarantee is capped at $1.7 billion of principal plus 85% of any interest and any other duly payable costs and expenses.
Any payments under the Guarantee will be netted off against payments to be made by Kazakhmys Finance under the loan agreements between it and Samruk-Kazyna.
As the Guarantee is several and covers the separate $300 million loan made by CDB to Samruk-Kazyna but not lent on for the benefit of the Group, the Company will be liable as to 85% of that amount i. e. up to $255 million if Samruk-Kazyna fails to make a payment due under that loan to CDB.
Furthermore, the Company has granted a separate $2.7 billion parent company guarantee to Samruk-Kazyna, pursuant to which the Company guarantees repayment of all amounts lent by Samruk-Kazyna to Kazakhmys Finance, as is typical in such corporate loan facilities.
The guarantees under this financing package took effect on 1 March 2010 following receipt of confirmation from the UK Listing Authority that shareholder approval for the transaction was not required.
com 177 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30.
Borrowings continued As at 31 December 2011, $1,300 million 2010: $700 million was drawn under the facility agreements signed to date.
Arrangement fees with an amortised cost as at 31 December 2011 of $19 million 2010: $12 million, gross cost before amortisation of $22 million 2010:$14 million, have been netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39.
The fair value of the Guarantee has been determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
The probability of a default by Samruk-Kazyna in respect of its obligations under the $3.0 billion financing line between Samruk-Kazyna and the CDB, with the consequence that CDB calls on the Guarantee, has been determined using the historical default rate for entities with Kazakhstans sovereign rating as provided by a recognised credit rating agency.
The cash flows that would result from such a default by Samruk-Kazyna have been discounted using a riskfree discount rate.
The right to net off payments made by the Company to the CDB under the Guarantee against the balance payable by Kazakhmys Finance to Samruk-Kazyna under the financing line between these parties is governed by English law and has been assumed to be effective in the event of such a default by Samruk-Kazyna.
Using this valuation basis, the fair value of the Guarantee is less than $5 million, an immaterial figure in the context of a financing line available to the Group of $2.7 billion.
Related party transaction Samruk-Kazyna is an entity wholly owned and controlled by the Government of Kazakhstan, the ultimate owner and controller of a 26% stake in the Company.
The transaction therefore constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of the Listing Rules.
Due to the size of the $255 million guarantee liability, the UK Listing Authority confirmed on 1 March 2010 that the transaction falls within the modified requirements for a smaller related party transaction set out in Listing Rule 11.1.
Revolving credit facilities The Group has available several revolving credit facilities entered into by Kazakhmys Finance, for general corporate purposes and to provide standby liquidity.
At 31 December 2011, facilities amounting to $250 million had maturity dates in March 2013 and a $50 million facility had a maturity date in September 2013, all of which were undrawn.

In June 2009 the facility was refinanced with a new 170 million facility for three years with a final maturity in June 2012 which attracted interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 3.00%.
On 21 July 2011, the facility was refinanced for a further four years with a final maturity in July 2015.
The facility was also increased from 170 million to 220 million, with interest now payable on the drawn balance at a rate of EURIBOR plus 2.25%.
The loan is secured over the inventories and receivables of MKM.
Undrawn facilities $ million 2011 2010 Revolving trade finance facility within MKM 101 33 31.
Employee benefits Kazakhmys LLC provides post-retirement benefits in Kazakhstan which are unfunded.
These benefits include one-time retirement grants, financial aid, dental care, medical benefits, long-term disability allowances, sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners, free tickets for city buses, privilege tickets for shuttle buses and funeral aid.
The amounts recognised in the income statements are as follows: $ million 2011 2010 Employers share of current service cost 2 1 Employers share of past service cost 151 9 Actuarial losses recognised in period 5 Interest cost on benefit obligation 14 4 172 14 During 2011, new legislation was enacted in Kazakhstan which increased the amounts payable for death and disability benefits.
Under the new legislation, which applies retrospectively, the benefits payable are calculated on the basis of average salaries of employees currently in service.
Prior to the change in the legislation, benefits payable were calculated on the basis of historic salaries defined by the legislation.
This change has resulted in an average increase of approximately 290% within each category of benefits payable under the legislation over the prior year.
The expense is recognised in the following line items of the income statements: $ million 2011 2010 Administrative expenses 158 10 Finance costs 14 4 172 14 As the change in the legislation is non-recurring and does not impact the underlying trading performance of the business, $146 million of the total charge of $172 million, which relates solely to the change in legislation, has been treated as a special item.

The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines at the dates of depletion of each of the deposits.
The present value of the provision has been calculated using a discount rate of 8% 2010: 8% per year.
The liability becomes payable at the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from one to 51 years.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, and the levels of discount and inflation rates.
com 179 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Provisions continued b Payments for licences for mining assets In accordance with its contracts for subsoil use, the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the Government of Kazakhstan for licensed deposits.
The total amount payable by the Group is discounted to its present value using a discount rate of 8% 2010: 8%.
The uncertainties include estimating the amount of the payments and their timing.
The amounts are payable prior to 2019. c Payments for licences for exploration assets In accordance with the terms of its exploration licence, Kazakhmys Petroleum, prior to its disposal on 23 December 2011, was liable to make payments to the Government for geological information and social commitments in Astana and the Aktobe region.
The present value of the obligations was estimated by applying a discount rate of 12% 2010: 12%.
d Other Other provisions are recorded where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and a future outflow of resources is considered probable.
Other provisions primarily relate to environmental pollution charges EPC incurred in prior periods where there remains uncertainty over their eventual amount and the timing of settlement.
The EPC provision arises from the tax audit conducted at Kazakhmys LLC for the years 2006 to 2008 inclusive, which identified a potential exposure resulting from a difference in the interpretation of legislation governing the applicability of stabilised rates applicable to EPC and related legislative matters.
At 31 December 2010, the Directors assessed the position of Kazakhmys LLC and made a provision reflecting the probability that a settlement would be negotiated with the tax authorities following agreement being reached on the interpretation of the relevant legislation.
Following developments during 2011, the tax authorities have reassessed the EPC liability for the years 2006 to 2008.
As a result, the EPC liability accrued as at 31 December 2011 has been revised to reflect the amended assessment provided by the tax authorities, notwithstanding that the Group has challenged the basis of certain of the claims assessed by the tax authorities.

Financial risk management The financial information disclosed in the tables relating to the year ended 31 December 2011 represents continuing operations only.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Groups Treasury department in close cooperation with the Groups business divisions under oversight of a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the monitoring of financial risks, management of the Groups cash resources, debt funding programmes and capital structure, approval of counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury Policy has been approved by the Board and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial markets and the financial exposures facing the Group.
The Treasury Policy covers specific areas of financial risk management, in particular, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups Treasury Committee and the Groups Internal Audit department monitor compliance with the Treasury Policy on a regular basis.
The Groups Treasury department prepares monthly treasury reports for senior management which monitor all major financial exposures and treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
In addition, a treasury report is prepared for each Board meeting which includes a summary of the credit markets and their impact on the implementation of the Groups strategy, progress on the Groups financing initiatives and the significant financial exposures faced by the Group.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivatives used for risk management purposes.
The Groups borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are controlled and managed centrally by the Groups Treasury department.
Liquidity retained within Kazakhstan is only held for working capital purposes.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3. a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates.
The Groups philosophy is generally not to hedge its core revenue streams.
In periods of significant market volatility or uncertainty, the Group may use derivative instruments as a means of reducing volatility and any negative impact on its operating cash flows.
Strict limits on the size and type of any derivative hedge transaction are laid down by the Board and subject to strict internal controls.
The Group does not hold any speculative financial instruments.
MKM uses natural hedging arising on back-to-back purchase and supply contracts to manage, to the fullest extent possible, its economic exposure to changes in the price of copper.
In the event of any timing mismatch on the purchase and supply contracts, MKM uses commodity futures to manage its short-term exposure to changes in the price of copper.
All commodity hedge contracts are for short-term duration less than 12 months.

Financial risk management continued b Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities by categories are as follows: $ million Notes 2011 2010 1 Loans and receivables 25, 26, 27 2,112 1,742 2 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 30, 32, 33 2,289 2,202 1 Loans and receivables comprise other non-current investments, trade and other receivables, current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
2 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise borrowings, provision for cash payments payments for licences, trade and other payables excluding payments received in advance, other taxes payable and royalties and mineral FYUSBDUJPO tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments and dividends payable by subsidiaries.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys Mining production entities, Kazakhmys Power and Kazakhmys Petroleum is the Kazakhstan tenge, with MKM having a Euro functional currency, Kazakhmys Services Ltd having a UK sterling functional currency, and the Company and the other entities within the Group having a US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar based revenues and certain costs, bank deposits, trade receivables and certain trade payables of Kazakhmys LLC, and the US dollar and UK sterling balances in respect of certain revenues, and trade receivables and payables of MKM.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
During 2011, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange transactions to purchase KZT against the USD with a value of $40 million per month from April through to December 2011.
The forward transactions were executed at rates averaging between 144.65 KZT USD and 145.44 KZT USD on a monthly basis.
The purpose of the forward contracts was to hedge the impact on KZT denominated operating costs of the possible appreciation of the tenge against the US dollar.
The swaps were closed out during 2011 and no positions remain outstanding in respect of 2012 or future years.
i Foreign currency exposure by company profile The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany amounts indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
As at 31 December 2011 and 2010 these exposures were as follows: $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other 2011 Company n a 6 Kazakhmys LLC 301 1 n a 2 Kazakhmys Sales Ltd n a Other trading companies 5 n a 2 Non-trading or holding companies 61 9 9 281 367 3 8 281 4 $ million US dollar UK sterling Euro KZT Other 2010 Company n a 2 Kazakhmys LLC 376 n a 1 Kazakhmys Sales Ltd n a Kazakhmys Petroleum 6 n a Other trading companies 54 Non-trading or holding companies 1 2 18 3 315 18 3 1 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 182
