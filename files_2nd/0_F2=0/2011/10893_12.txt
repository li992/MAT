National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 39 Notes to the consolidated financial statements - analysis of items in the primary statements 1.
Segmental analysis The Board of Directors is National Grid Gas plc's chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8 on operating segments.
The segmental analysis is based on the information the Board of Directors uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource allocation between segments.
The performance of operating segments is assessed principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items.
The following table describes the main activities for each operating segment: Gas Transmission - the gas transmission network in the UK and the associated UK liquefied natural gas LNG storage activities Gas Distribution - four of the eight regional networks of Great Britain's gas distribution system Gas Metering - regulated gas metering activities in the UK Other activities relate to the xoserve business which provides transportation transaction services on behalf of all the major gas network transportation companies, including ourselves, together with corporate activities.
Our segments are unchanged from those reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
All of the Company's sales and operations take place within the UK.
Sales between businesses are priced having regard to the regulatory and legal requirements that the businesses are subject to, which include requirements to avoid cross-subsidies.

Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges A number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the 2011 Budget Report and are expected to be enacted in the 2011 Finance Act.
However, the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 26% from 1 April 2011 has been substantively enacted and deferred tax balances have been calculated at this rate.
Other changes such as the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 25% from April 2012, with further 1% reductions to follow in each of the succeeding two years, will result in a UK corporation tax rate of 23% from April 2014.
These changes have not been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date and have therefore not been reflected in these financial statements.
The outcome of the ongoing UK consultation process on the reform of the controlled foreign company legislation, as part of the wider UK corporate tax reform agenda, is expected in the UK Finance Bill 2012.
We will monitor the expected changes for their implications on our holdings in foreign operations.

The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2011 was 112m 2010: 110m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2011, 26m of the total restructuring provision 2010: 26m related to the restructuring of our Liquefied Natural Gas LNG storage facilities, and 14m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2010: 5m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid over the next two years.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2011 include 5m 2010: 6m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 22m 2010: 21m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain, but should largely be over the next two years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.

f Litigation and claims Metering competition investigation As previously reported, on 25 February 2008 the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority GEMA announced it had decided we had breached Chapter 11 of the Competition Act 1998 and Article 82 now Article 102 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and fined us 41.6m.
Following appeals, the Competition Appeal Tribunal reduced the fine to 30m and the Court of Appeal further reduced the fine to 15m.
On 22 March 2010, we applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's judgement.
On 28 July 2010, the Supreme Court denied our application and this ends the legal process.
The 15m fine was paid to GEMA on 1 April 2010.
Gas Distribution mains replacement investigation As previously reported, in October 2008 we informed Ofgem that mains replacement activity carried out by our Gas Distribution business may have been inaccurately reported.
Ofgem has now concluded its investigation and, following the reaching of a settlement between Ofgem and the Company, on 6 January 2011, Ofgem announced its proposed decision to impose a penalty of 8m and to find the Company in breach of certain obligations in respect of the reporting of mains replacement data.
Ofgem also stated that the penalty would have been higher had it not been for the cooperation and corrective action by National Grid.
On 10 March 2011, following the end of the period in which representations could be made, Ofgem wrote to the Company to confirm its decision.
On 13 May 2011, we received the Final Penalty Notice and the penalty has now been paid.

Actuarial information on pensions The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is subject to independent actuarial valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers' contribution which, together with the specified contributions payable by employees and the proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The scheme provides final salary defined benefits for employees who joined prior to 31 March 2002 and defined contribution benefits for employees joining from 1 April 2002.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out by Towers Watson as at 31 March 2007.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets was 12,923m and the value of the assets represented 97% of the actuarial value of benefits due to members, calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2007 on an ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.
There was a funding deficit of 442m 327m net of tax on the valuation date in light of which National Grid agreed a recovery plan with the trustees.
The actuarial valuation showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 32.4% of pensionable earnings 29.4% employers and 3% employees.
In addition, the employers pay an allowance for administration expenses which was 3.2% of pensionable earnings, giving a total company rate of 32.6%.
The employer contribution rate will be reviewed as part of the current valuation, while the administration rate is reviewed annually.
Contributions to the scheme during 2011 12 will be determined as part of the current valuation negotiations with the Trustees.
Asset allocations The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Equities 33.6 34.7 Corporate bonds 32.4 34.5 Gilts 26.6 22.0 Property 6.1 6.2 Other 1.3 2.6 Total 100.0 100.0 Actuarial assumptions The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the scheme.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the scheme's actuaries.
The current target asset allocation for the scheme is 32% equities and 68% bonds, property and other.

ii A promotional age related scale has been used where appropriate.
iii In September 2010, the UK Government changed the basis for statutory pension increases from the Retail Price Index RPI to the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The scheme rules specifically reference RPI.
As a consequence the impact of the Government's move to CPI was predominantly limited to National Grid's Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.
The financial consequence of the change as at 31 March 2011 was an approximate 50m reduction in present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The assumed life expectations for a retiree at age 65 are as follows: 2011 2010 years years Today: Males 22.1 20.8 Females 24.9 23.3 In 20 years: Males 24.3 23.2 Females 27.3 25.6 National Grid Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 59 26.

Supplementary information on derivative financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to alter exposure to market or credit risks.
We use derivatives to manage our treasury risks.
Treasury financial instruments Derivatives are used for hedging purposes in the management of exposure to market risks.
This enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets, and mitigates the market risk which would otherwise arise from the Company assets and liabilities.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained in note 28.
Derivatives held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
These are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the life of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained, and designated as cash flow hedges where they qualify, to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, they are designated as cash flow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to remeasurements within the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.

Financial risk Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk, including foreign exchange risk: fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Boards of Directors of National Grid plc and the Company.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units.
The Boards provide written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity as discussed further in our treasury policy, described on page 18 of the Operating and Financial Review.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from non-sterling future commercial transactions and non-sterling recognised assets and liabilities.
With respect to near term foreign exchange risk, we use foreign exchange forwards to manage foreign exchange transaction exposure.
Our policy is to hedge a minimum percentage of known contracted foreign currency flows in order to mitigate foreign currency movements in the intervening period.
Where cash forecasts are less certain, we generally cover a percentage of the foreign currency flows depending on the level of agreed probability for those future cash flows.
During the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2010, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign exchange risk as follows: 2011 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 82 1 - - 83 Financial investments 242 - - - 242 Borrowings i 5,962 876 719 345 7,902 Pre-derivative position 5,638 875 719 345 7,577 Derivative effect 1,406 848 720 345 507 Net debt position 7,044 27 1 - 7,070 2010 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 1 - - - 1 Financial investments 326 - - - 326 Borrowings i 5,510 1,119 713 330 7,672 Pre-derivative position 5,183 1,119 713 330 7,345 Derivative effect 1,687 1,129 714 330 486 Net debt position 6,870 10 1 - 6,859 i Includes bank overdrafts There was no significant currency exposure on other financial instruments, including trade receivables and payables and other receivables and payables.

Financial risk continued a Market risk continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on our borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy as further explained on page 19 is to minimise the finance costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt subject to certain constraints.
Some of our borrowings issued are index-linked, that is their cost is linked to changes in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI.
We believe that these borrowings provide a hedge for revenues and regulatory asset values that are also RPI-linked.
Interest rate risk arising from our financial investments is primarily variable being mainly composed of short-dated money funds.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: 2011 2010 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings Less than 1 year 83 98 In 1 - 2 years 24 1 In 2 - 3 years 501 22 In 3 - 4 years - 730 In 4 - 5 years - - More than 5 years 2,658 2,777 3,266 3,628 Floating interest rate borrowings including RPI linked 4,583 4,044 Non-interest bearing borrowings 53 - Total borrowings 7,902 7,672 During the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2010, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2011 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 83 - - - 83 Financial investments - 242 - - 242 Borrowings iii 3,266 958 3,625 53 7,902 Pre-derivative position 3,183 716 3,625 53 7,577 Derivative effect 1,413 1,135 229 - 507 Net debt position iv 1,770 1,851 3,396 53 7,070 2010 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 1 - - - 1 Financial investments - 326 - - 326 Borrowings iii 3,628 914 3,130 - 7,672 Pre-derivative position 3,627 588 3,130 - 7,345 Derivative effect 756 387 117 - 486 2,871 975 3,013 - 6,859 i The post-derivative impact represents financial instruments linked to UK RPI.

Financial risk continued b Fair value analysis The following is an analysis of our financial instruments measured at fair value.
They are reported in a tiered hierarchy based on the valuation methodology described on page 19, and reflecting the significance of market observable inputs.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market.
In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.
2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Available-for-sale investments 223 - - 223 307 - - 307 Derivative financial instruments - 614 1 615 - 635 2 637 223 614 1 838 307 635 2 944 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - 108 - 108 - 151 - 151 Total 223 506 1 730 307 484 2 793 Level 1: Financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are based directly or indirectly on observable market data.
Level 3: Financial instruments valued using techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.
During the year no transfers have been made between the hierarchy levels.
The financial instruments classified as level 3 are currency swaps where the currency forward curve is illiquid.
The changes in the value of our level 3 derivative financial instruments are as follows: 2011 2010 Level 3 Level 3 Valuation Valuation m m At 1 April 2 1 Net gains for the year i - 3 Settlements 1 - At 31 March 1 2 i Gains are attributable to assets or liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and have been recognised in finance costs in the income statement A reasonably possible change in assumptions is unlikely to result in a material change in the fair value of the level 3 instruments.

Financial risk continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a contract.
Credit risk is managed on a portfolio basis for National Grid as a whole.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
Our limits are managed by the central treasury department of National Grid, as explained in our treasury policy on page 18 to 20.
As at 31 March 2011 and 2010, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under derivative financial contracts as shown in note 12 was 615m 2010: 637m : after netting agreements it was 576m 2010: 550m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 17.
Wholesale and retail credit risk Our principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value for each credit rating.
Sales to retail customers, such as those requiring connections, are usually settled in cash or using major credit cards.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 14. d Liquidity analysis We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date: Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2011 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 679 223 501 6,645 8,048 Interest payments on borrowings i 237 237 219 3,494 4,187 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 455 22 - - 477 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts - receipts 95 119 132 726 1,072 Derivative contract - payments 23 32 23 549 627 Total at 31 March 2011 1,299 395 611 9,962 12,267 Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2010 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 330 252 221 7,091 7,894 Interest payments on borrowings i 248 253 256 3,819 4,576 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 473 4 - - 477 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contract - receipts 135 77 91 893 1,196 Derivative contract - payments 60 41 48 637 786 Total at 31 March 2010 976 473 434 10,654 12,537 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking account of future issues.
Floating rate interest is estimated using a forward interest rate curve as at 31 March.
Payments are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the Company can be required to settle.

Financial risk continued e Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates and the UK Retail Prices Index.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant, and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12 month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: and sensitivity to the Retail Prices Index does not take into account any changes to revenue or operating costs that are affected by the Retail Prices Index or inflation generally.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative impact on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK Retail Prices Index and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.
2011 2010 Other Other Income Equity Income Equity statement Reserves statement Reserves - m - m - m - m UK Retail Prices Index - 0.50% 12 - 10 - UK interest rates - 0.50% 713 516 The income statement sensitivities impact interest expense and financial instrument remeasurements.
f Capital and risk management Our objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to remain within regulatory constraints.
The principal measure of balance sheet efficiency is gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of regulatory asset value.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2011 was 54% compared with 57% at 31 March 2010.
We regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to manage the level of gearing.
Our licence and some of our bank loan agreements impose lower limits for the long-term credit ratings that the Company must hold.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance.

Share options and reward plans National Grid operates three principal forms of share option and award plans in which our employees and Directors participate.
These plans include an employee Sharesave scheme, a Performance Share Plan PSP and the Deferred Share Plan.
On 14 June 2010, National Grid completed a rights issue.
The number of shares allocated to employees under share plans has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The terms of National Grid's share plans were adjusted such that participants of the various plans were no better or worse off as a result of the rights issue.
Active share plans Sharesave scheme - share options are offered to employees at 80% of the market price at the time of invitation.
The share options are exercisable on completion of a three and or five year Save As You Earn contract.
PSP - awards delivered in National Grid shares are made to Executive Directors of National Grid and senior employees.
The criteria are based on National Grid's total shareholder return 50% when compared to FTSE 100 and annualised growth of National Grid's EPS 50% when compared to growth in RPI.
Deferred Share Plan - 50% of any Annual Performance Plan awarded to Executive Directors of National Grid and a fixed percentage awarded to senior employees is automatically deferred into National Grid shares which are held in trust for three years before release.

The fair value of awards with total shareholder return performance conditions are calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model.
Fair values of other awards are calculated as the share price at the grant date, less the present value of dividends not received in the vesting period.
Volatility was derived based on the following, and is assumed to revert from its current implied level to its long-run mean, based on historical volatility under ii below: i implied volatility in traded options over National Grid plc's shares: ii historical volatility of National Grid plc's shares over a term commensurate with the expected life of each option: and iii implied volatility of comparator companies where options in their shares are traded.
