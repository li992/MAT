Financial Results Accounting At 31 March 2011, the Group had eleven investments which it was deemed to control by virtue of having the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the project entities.
This is unchanged from 31 March 2010.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the results of these companies are required to be consolidated in the Groups financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
However, these investments form part of a portfolio of similar investments which are held for investment purposes and managed as a whole and there is no distinction made between those investments classified as subsidiaries and those which are not.
Further, all debt owed by the Groups investments is non-recourse and the Group does not participate in their day to day management.
As in previous periods, in order to provide shareholders with further information regarding the Groups net asset value, coupled with greater transparency in the Companys capacity for investment and ability to make distributions, the results have been restated in proforma tables which follow the Financial Results.
The proforma tables are prepared with all investments accounted for on an Investment basis.
By deconsolidating the subsidiary investments, the performance of the business under consolidated IFRS basis may be compared with the results under the Investment basis.
The proforma tables show all investments accounted for on an Investment basis, which are reconciled to the consolidated financial statements on a line by line basis.

Fair value movements are a 20.9m profit 2010: 7.2m which represents the increase in the portfolio valuation recognised in the income statement.
The portfolio valuation benefited from a strong performance from the portfolio, supported by inflation above the valuation assumption and a mark to market uplift on the Kemble Water junior loan.
Further detail on the valuation movement is given in the Investment Advisers Report.
Earnings on an Investment basis were 45.1m, an increase of over 20m compared to the prior year, with earnings per share of 8.9p up 2.4p or 37% as compared to 2010.
The uplift in earnings reflects the positive contribution from acquisitions coupled with a good performance from the portfolio without the adverse impact of changing valuation assumptions that affected prior year earnings.
On a consolidated IFRS basis, the earnings per share were 9.0p 2010: 1.6p.
The results on a consolidated IFRS basis show a more significant improvement than on an Investment basis due to factors arising in the prior year.
In particular in the prior year the value of the subsidiaries recognised under IFRS was impacted more by the increase in the risk free rate in that year than the market values of the subsidiaries that underpinned earnings on the Investment basis.
Total income on a consolidated IFRS basis increased to 187.9m 2010: 159.7m driven by a full year contribution from 2010 acquisitions and increased construction revenue on project variations.
Profit before tax and valuation movements on a consolidated IFRS basis decreased despite the increased revenues due to reduced finance costs in the prior year.
The prior year benefited materially from lower finance costs arising from the effect of negative inflation on the index link bond financing on the Home Office and Exeter Courts projects.

Total fees accruing to InfraRed Capital Partners Limited the Investment Adviser totalled 8.1m 2010: 6.0m in the year, comprising the 1.1% p. a. management fee 1.5% for assets in construction, the 1.0% fee on the acquisitions made, and the 0.1m p. a. advisory fee.
The increase is a combination of the 1.0% acquisition fee on a larger volume of acquisitions and the management fee on a growing portfolio value.
In addition, the Group contracted in the year with other parts of the HSBC Group on an arms length basis for the provision of bank accounts, foreign exchange hedges, and insurance broking.
Other expenses are down 0.5m from the prior year, reflecting a reduced level of unsuccessful bid costs.
