NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Segmental information Operating segments The Group reports four segments whose revenue and results are reported to the Board.
The principal activities of these segments are as follows: Cobham Aerospace and Security Providing end-to-end avionics and communication equipment, law enforcement and national security solutions, and satellite communication equipment for land, sea and air applications.
Cobham Defence Systems Critical technology for network centric and intelligence operations, moving information around the digital battlefield with customised and off-the-shelf solutions for people and systems to communicate on land, sea and air.
Cobham Mission Systems Providing safety and survival systems for extreme environments, nose-to-tail refuelling systems and wing-tip to wing-tip weapons carriage and release equipment for fast jets, transport aircraft and rotor craft, and remote controlled robots and fully-equipped bomb disposal vehicles for homeland security and military applications.
Cobham Aviation Services Delivering outsourced aviation services for military and civil customers worldwide through military training, special mission flight operations, outsourced commercial aviation and aircraft engineering.
Changes to the Groups segmental reporting structure were announced in February 2011, to bring together businesses with similar markets or technology consistent with the Groups strategic objective of creating scale in each of its markets.
To reflect these changes, Avionics and Surveillance has been renamed Aerospace and Security to better reflect the operations of this division.
A number of businesses were moved from Defence Systems to Aerospace and Security including Defence Communications, Antenna Systems, Passive Microwave Products and US Composites.
Further changes to the segmental reporting structure followed the announcement in the interim management statement released on 6 May 2011 that the Group was planning to divest two non-core businesses, Analytic Solutions and Commercial Systems.
The segmental results shown below reflect the current structure of the results as reported to the Board, with non-core businesses reported as a separate segment.
The comparative information shown below has been restated to reflect these changes.

Reclassifications include the transfer of assets held for sale see note 18.
Group financial statements 78 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each cash generating unit CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
As a result of the site integration and other Excellence in Delivery activity CGUs are now typically considered tobe Strategic Business Units SBUs while in 2010 CGUs were typically Business Units.
In this year of transition a review has been performed to ensure that this change has not prevented any impairments from being recognised had the testing been performed at Business Unit level, with no issues identified.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
The only specific condition in 2011 related to a business held for sale as at 31 December 2011 and 7.0m of goodwill has been written down to align the net assets of the business with the likely proceeds of divestment.
If this business was not held for sale then no adjustment would have been required on a value in use valuation basis.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The Group annually prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years at SBU level and this is approved by management.
The growth rate assumed after this five year period is based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The long-term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.0%.
The growth rates assume that demand for the Groups products in the USA and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment inthe long-term future.
Taking into account the expectation of future market conditions management believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices.
Where five year forecasts are not available for a CGU the long-term growth projections are applied to the following years cash flowforecast.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are within the range 9.0% to 10.8% 2010: 10.1%, having considered the country and currency risks inthe principal territories in which the Group operates.
The goodwill allocated to four CGUs are considered to be individually significant as they represent more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value.
Key assumptions and sensitivities of these CGUs are as follows: Goodwill carrying value Headroom Pre-tax m m discount rate Sensor Systems 229 246 9.7% Antenna Systems 142 1,152 9.5% Tactical Communications and Surveillance 109 383 9.4% Life Support 86 586 9.7% Sensitivity analysis has been performed and no impairment losses would arise if the discount rate increased by 20%, if the growth rate was zero or if cash flows reduced by 20%.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 1.7m 2010: 1.7m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property except depreciation.
The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 5 and 25 years, commencing between 1998 and 2010.
The fair value of the Groups UK investment properties has been assessed to be 11.8m 2010: 10.8m.
These values are based on Directors estimates using current market data.
The fair value of the Groups investment property in the USA is assessed to be US$10.5m 2010: US$10.0m based on market data.
Investments in joint ventures The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Aviation Services segment: 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England.
50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England.
50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, the governance structure for Aviation Dfense Service SA is such that the Group has joint control with itspartner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
Within the Cobham Aerospace and Security segment the Group has a 50% interest in Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC, a company incorporated inthe USA.

All financial instruments measured at fair value in the table above are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by the use of valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates, whilst the fair value of bank overdrafts and floating rateloans are based on market values.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are assumed to approximate totheir fair values due to their short-term nature.
As at 31 December 2011, the fair value of the fixed rate senior notes is 370.4m 2010: 394.7m.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of all other financial assets and liabilities recorded in these financial statements is equal to, or approximates to, their fairvalue.
The Groups investment in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft companies as described in note 16d is classified as available for sale.
The Group does not hold any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity.

It is anticipated that most of these costs will be incurred in the next financial year.
Contract loss provisions Contract loss provisions represent managements best estimate of the amount by which the expected benefits from certain specific contracts are lower thanthe unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under those contracts.
The timeframe within which such provisions will unwind varies by contract, butisgenerally within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Aircraft maintenance provisions are established in respect of significant periodic maintenance costs, where maintenance activity is required on leased operational aircraft or engines on a cycle greater than 12 months, and where specific conditions exist regarding the state of a leased aircraft on its return to thelessor at the end of the lease.
Costs are charged to the income statement on the basis of utilisation of the aircraft and are credited to the provision.
The provision is then utilised by absorbing the actual costs incurred in carrying out the maintenance activity or on incurring the expenditure required to return theaircraft to the state of maintenance required before return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Provisions related to businesses divested These provisions relate to businesses divested in prior years and include amounts provided in respect of the divestment of MTS in 2009 and warranties given on the divestments of the Countermeasures operations and the Fluid and Air group in 2005.
All amounts have been determined based on managements current estimates of likely outcomes.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
Other provisions Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of announced business restructuring and legal claims.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 511.2m 2010: 403.9m.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012, with further reductions proposed to reduce the rate to 23% by 1 April2014.

There is no material ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement.
Foreign exchange and inflation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income statement as part of operating profit.
The movement in the fair value of currency swaps which offset movements in currency balances are offset against exchange movements in those balances in the income statement.
Full details of the Groups financial instrument accounting policies and risk management strategies, objectives and policies are set out in the statement ofaccounting policies and in note 25.
Following the divestment of the Analytic Solutions business and repayment of a portion of floating rate debt during the year as described in note 19, a number of interest rate swaps were cancelled.
These interest rate swaps had previously been designated as cash flow hedges and the related hedge reserve has been reclassified to the income statement.
Interest rate swaps which had previously been designated as cash flow hedges were also cancelled in 2009, and the related hedge reserve is being amortised over the life of the original forecast issuance the hedge item.
In 2011, 3.6m 2010: 3.1m was reclassified from the hedge reserve to the income statement and reflected in finance expense.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 24.0m 2010: 30.8m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
0.8m 2010: 3.7m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2011.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since2003.
Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries, the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2009.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2011.
Group financial statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 91 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED As part of the Groups risk management strategy for defined benefit obligations, certain liabilities relating to past service of pensioner and deferred members of defined benefit schemes were subject to a buy-in arrangement on 14 December 2011.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the schemes impacted transferred assets to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides annuity payments equal to the liabilities covered by the arrangement as they fall due.
This eliminates the Groups exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities and is a meaningful, but not yet significant, first step of a project to review the Groups exposure to risks associated with pension obligations.
The buy-in did not impact on the reported profits of the Group for the year or on the defined benefit obligations calculated under IAS 19.
The insurance contract asset is measured at a value equal to the related liabilities.
Contributions of 19.6m were payable into the schemes representing the difference between the cost of this asset and the net obligations transferred.
Additional contributions of 7.9m were paid in 2010 to the CPP in connection with the disposal of the Fluid and Air group which completed in 2005.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2011 or 2010 for the defined benefit schemes.
Following the disposal of the Engineering Consultancy Group business, curtailment gains of 1.4m have been recognised in the income statement.
The amount recognised in the income statement also includes 12.5m relating to past service following changes to the rate of certain UKpensionincreases.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2011 2010 UK Schemes USA Scheme UK Schemes USA Scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.62% 3.62% 4.09% 4.09% Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 3.12% 3.12% 3.59% 3.59% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.12% 3.12% 2.89% 3.59% Discount rate 4.85% 4.85% 5.42% 5.54% Inflation assumption 3.12% 3.12% 3.59% 3.59% Expected return on scheme assets 5.12% 5.46% 6.25% 6.80% The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experience of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality assumption used in 2010 was denoted by actuaries as PA92 year of birth long cohort.
The more recent tables known asSAPS CMI 09 have been used for 2011.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Further life Year of birth Year age 65 expectancy Male 1946 2011 22.5 years Female 1946 2011 24.6 years Male 1980 2045 25.8 years Female 1980 2045 27.9 years At 31 December 2011 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2010: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2010: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2010: 80% of eligible members on retirement.

The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$30.1m 2010: US$26.0m and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme is US$18.4m 2010: US$17.5m.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below: Increasing the discount rate by 0.1% would decrease scheme liabilities by 10.2m.
Increasing the inflation rate by 0.1% would increase scheme liabilities by 6.9m.
If each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by 11.8m.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since transition to IFRS is 166.8m loss 2010: 126.2m loss.
Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year for changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities, approximately 60m relating to the decrease in the discount rate mitigated by approximately 40m increase relating to the inflation assumption and 19m relating to changes in the mortality assumption.
The actual return on scheme assets was 7.6m loss 2010: gain 54.0m.
The Group expects to contribute 19.4m to its defined benefit pension schemes in2012.

Group financial statements 94 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 25.
Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt, and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or use complex derivative financialinstruments.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments including those in Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
The carrying amounts of the Groups total foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, translated at the relevant year-end exchange rates, are as follows: 2011 2010 m US$ AUS$ US$ AUS$ Monetary assets 235.5 100.9 107.8 268.8 86.7 85.3 Monetary liabilities 647.3 49.4 98.8 882.9 37.8 109.5 Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group typically borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge.
The following borrowings included in monetary liabilities in the table above and foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets: m 2011 2010 US dollar borrowings 460.1 526.9 US dollar foreign exchange contracts 193.0 161.0 On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in other comprehensive income and the translation reserve note 27.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process toactively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.
The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non-US based subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the USA.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for net sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: US$m amount Average US$: exchange rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 Expiring within one year 138.5 182.7 1.59 1.56 Expiring within one to two years 63.8 52.4 1.59 1.60 Expiring after two years 46.2 83.1 1.61 1.61 248.5 318.2 1.59 1.58 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is December 2014.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and includes the effect of derivative financial instruments.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity.

In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency, asfollows: 2011 2010 m Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity US dollars 10% 12.7 12.7 10% 14.2 14.2 Euros 10% 10.5 10.5 10% 5.6 5.6 Australian dollars 10% 0.1 0.1 10% 0.1 0.1 Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short-term borrowings, principally in US dollars and Australian dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage theinterest rate risk.
Borrowings are held under both fixed and floating rates as follows: m 2011 2010 Fixed rates Senior notes 313.0 334.2 Floating rates Bank loans and overdrafts 162.4 361.2 Senior notes 99.8 99.0 Loan notes 1.5 3.7 Other borrowings and finance leases 1.4 1.0 265.1 464.9 578.1 799.1 All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are as follows, all are designated as cash flow hedges: Period of swap contract 2011 2010 Hedged item Fixed rate from to Currency value m Currency value m US dollar loans 3.22% June 2010 June 2013 US$65.0m 41.8 US$260.0m 166.1 3.49% March 2008 March 2013 US$80.0m 51.5 US$139.0m 88.8 3.61% August 2008 August 2013 US$150.0m 96.5 US$211.0m 134.8 Australian dollar loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$74.4m 49.1 AUS$82.7m 54.1 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$14.3m 9.4 AUS$16.1m 10.5 248.3 454.3 The Group does not currently hold any interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments.
Surplus funds are placed on short term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.
Group financial statements 96 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 1.0% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short-term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.

At 31 December 2011, 202.1m 2010: 46.6m was available to the Group under existing facilities, including the 300.0m multi-currency facility which expires in July 2012.
As shown in note 19, a new facility for US$360.0m has been agreed to replace this facility.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range ofreputable financial institutions, such counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which includes a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area islimited further by setting a maximum level for deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impairedreceivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2011, 6.5% 2010: 6.1% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2011 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 16. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure lessthan 1.0m of receivables.
Group financial statements Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 97 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The Group has pledged assets only in respect of bank accounts as disclosed in note 17 and a small amount of finance leases.
No assets have been pledged inrespect of any of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bankbalances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
During 2011, a specific operational contract was agreed for which it was deemed appropriate to enter into a swap to manage the inherent inflation risk inthecontract.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total shareholders equity, excluding non-controlling interests, totalling 1,018.6m at 31 December 2011 2010: 1,075.8m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and alsoeach time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements are also considered, these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the Group banking arrangements or defaults during the currentor prioryear.
During the year the Board considered that the proceeds from exiting sub-scale and other non-strategic businesses were estimated to be broadly surplus to funding requirements and consequently 150.0m of capital was returned to shareholders through a share buy-back programme: further details are shown innote 26.

No new shares have been issued during 2011 in connection with the exercise of share options.
In addition to the Ordinary Shares described above, 19,700 6% second cumulative Preference Shares have been issued which represent 0.1% of total issued share capital.
These are non-redeemable and are classified as borrowings with a value of 19,700.
Group financial statements 98 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The shareholders of the 6% second cumulative Preference Shares are entitled to receive a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 6% per annum inpriority to the payment of dividends on the Ordinary Shares.
In addition, on a return of assets on the liquidation or otherwise of the Company, the assets available for distribution are to be applied first in repaying to the holders of the 6% second cumulative Preference Shares the amounts paid up on their shares.

Foreign exchange movements arising on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are also included here and following the settlement of the financial instrument, any balances remaining are transferred to retained earnings.
The hedging reserve reflects movements in fair values on cash flow hedging derivatives as detailed in notes 23 and 25.
The share options reserve includes the cost of share options as assessed under IFRS 2 together with deferred tax provided under IAS 12 relating to share-based payments, where the calculated future tax benefit is in excess of the amount charged to date under IFRS 2.
Where share options which gave rise to charges under IFRS 2 have been exercised, the appropriate proportion of the share options reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings includes the purchase of Cobham plc ordinary shares by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust in connection with the Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan, the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme and the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme, and the allocation of the shares upon the exercise of options.
Unallocated shares are held as treasury shares.

The Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan BCP.
The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares which mainly vest 50% based on the Groups three year Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups underlying EPS over the same period.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual performance bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn up to a 2:1 matching award of shares against the gross bonus invested, based on three-year Economic Profit growth targets.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period.
The scheme also includes a time-only section which is offered to participants based in the USA.
This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
Further details of the above schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 47 and 48.
Entry to the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is available to all employees of participating UK subsidiaries.
Employees may purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the closing market price on the date of grant during a two-week period each year, up to an HMRC imposed maximum contribution value of 3,000 in any one year.
The shares so purchased are generally placed in the employees share savings plan and will only be released to employees who remain in the Groups employment for a period of three years from the date of grant.
The rules of the BCP scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards.
For the award vesting in 2011, the operation of the gross up mechanism resulted in an additional 348,267 matching shares being awarded to the holders of the 541,452 matched shares exercised in year.
Under the ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year.
The average share price in that period was 2.024 2010:2.330.

Theexpected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions andbehavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rate is based on an assessment of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contractsbyemployees.
Most participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuationmodel.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes Share appreciation rights SARs were issued in 2006 and 2007 to a number of senior executives which required the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
These awards vested in 2009 and the majority expired in November 2011.
The expense for the year for these awards was 0.2m credit 2010: 0.2m credit, arising from changes in the fair value of the outstanding awards at the balance sheet date together with additional amounts arising at the date of exercise.
The fair value of the SARs outstanding at 31 December 2011 was 0.133 2010: 0.204.

Contingent liabilities and commitments At 31 December 2011, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements.
As the conditions of these guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been made at the year end.
The Company has also committed, in connection with the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project, to invest 6.0m in the equity share capital of three companies and to provide additional funding of 18.1m in the form of redeemable loan notes by March 2013 at the latest.
In addition, a number of performance guarantees and letters of credit have been provided to secure the funding of this project.
No provision was made at 31 December 2011 or 2010 in connection with these guarantees.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that theoutcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations thatarise in the ordinary course of business.
In 2010, the Group identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years.
The contract was in respect of goods provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount ofrevenue for the Group.
The circumstances surrounding this remain under review and the outcome still cannot be estimated.
Resolution may take some time.
No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 3.9m 2010: 5.4m.
