Debt investors benefit from security over a pool of investment properties, and the Groups investment in the Bristol Alliance Limited Partnership, which totals 8.7bn at 31 March 2011 2010: 7.8bn.
The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial exibility when the loan to value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively.
If these limits are exceeded the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage the reduction in gearing see note 28.
The interest rate is xed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date for each MTN, whereupon the interest rate for the last two years is LIBOR plus a step-up margin.
The effective interest rate includes the amortisation of issue costs.
The MTN are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.

The new MTN did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTN.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expenses in the income statement.
