62 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Accounts 1.
Accounting policies General information Spectris plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
Statement of compliance and basis of preparation The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice: these are presented on pages 109 to 116.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Business Review on pages 1 to 27.
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 31.
In addition, Note 2 to the financial statements includes the groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Having reviewed the groups plans and available financial facilities, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the groups accounts.
There are no key sensitivities identified in relation to this conclusion.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The key judgements made in respect of the appropriateness of the group accounting policies relate to: the timing of revenue recognition where the group has some responsibility for installation activity: the classification of financial instruments in relation to hedge accounting: the classification of retirement benefit arrangements between defined benefit and defined contribution schemes: the point at which development activity meets the cost capitalisation threshold.
The directors do not consider the practical application of any of these judgements to involve significant subjectivity or uncertainty.
The estimates and associated assumptions used are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are recognised in the following areas: business combinations in relation to the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities Note 28 : goodwill in relation to the assumptions underpinning impairment testing Note 13 : retirement benefit schemes in relation to the assumptions used to value plan assets and liabilities Note 8 : provisions and contingent liabilities in relation to determining the quantum and timing of managements best estimate of outflows Notes 22 and 29.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by group entities to all periods presented in these financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted There are a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2011.
None of these have been adopted early in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are anticipated to have any impact on the results or statement of financial position reported in these consolidated financial statements.
None of these new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not yet effective are anticipated to materially change the groups published accounting policies.

Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings and associates equity-accounted investments.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are recognised initially at cost.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate translation reserve within the statement of changes in equity.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date with any exchange differences arising on retranslation being recognised in the statement of income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the groups exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The accounting policies applied in these circumstances are described under the heading Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting below.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, it does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are presented as current or non-current based on their contracted maturity dates.
Cash flow hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments may be transacted to hedge the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or of highly probable forecast transactions, caused by changes in exchange rates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated in a cash flow hedge relationship with a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss arising is recognised in the hedging reserve via the statement of comprehensive income.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the statement of income.
When the forecast transaction subsequently occurs and results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability that impacts on the statement of income, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and presented within the statement of income.
When the forecast transaction subsequently occurs and results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and included within the initial cost of the non-financial asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is either sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover: or the group revokes the designation: or the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
If a derivative financial instrument is not formally designated in a cash flow hedge relationship, any change in fair value is recognised in the statement of income.

Accounting policies continued Net investment hedge accounting The group uses US dollar and euro-denominated borrowings and derivative financial instruments as a hedge against the translation exposure on the groups net investment in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the statement of income.
The group takes advantage of cross-currency swaps for some of its US dollar-denominated private placement borrowings.
The swaps have the effect of converting fixed rate US dollar borrowings into synthetic fixed rate euro-denominated borrowings.
The value of the element of the swap that locks interest payments at a fixed euro interest rate changes as US dollar variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates change.
Under IAS 39s rules, such changes in value are considered to be ineffective as a net investment hedge and accordingly they are recognised in the statement of income.
Business combinations and goodwill The group applies IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations for transactions arising after 1 January 2010.
This changed the groups definition of the cost of business combinations and the treatment of contingent consideration.
The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration depends on whether this was initially recognised as equity or as a liability and whether the event is considered a measurement period adjustment.
Transaction costs on a business combination are expensed as incurred.
For transactions relating to acquisitions before 1 January 2010, subsequent adjustments to contingent consideration are made against goodwill, and the transaction costs on a business combination are included in the cost of acquisition and thus capitalised.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings over the net fair value to the group of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost which represents the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the combination, and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
This estimate of recoverable amount is determined at each balance sheet date.
The groups identified cashgenerating units are smaller than reportable segments.
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business outlook for the cash-generating unit, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Reportable segments are operating segments that either meet the thresholds and conditions set out in IFRS 8 or are considered by the Board to be appropriately designated as reportable segments.
Segment results are the results reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and represent adjusted operating profits for definitions, see Note 3 and include an allocation of head office expenses.
Segment results exclude tax and financing items.
Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables.
Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables, provisions and other payables.
Unallocated items represent corporate and deferred taxation balances, defined benefit scheme liabilities and all components of net debt.

Accounting policies continued Intangible assets The cost of acquiring software including associated implementation costs where applicable that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset.
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the statement of income in the year in which they are incurred unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation.
These criteria include demonstration of the technical feasibility and intent of completing a new intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
From the point where expenditure meets the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives.
The directors consider that, due to the nature of projects undertaken, the proportion of development costs incurred that meets the criteria for capitalisation is immaterial.
Other intangible assets that are separately acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised at fair value.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets determined on an asset-by-asset basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years Patents and contractual rights up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contractual right Technology up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying technology acquired Trade names up to 20 years Customer-related 3 to 10 years, dependent upon the underlying contractual arrangements and specific circumstances such as customer retention experience Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost which from 1 January 2009 includes capitalised borrowing costs where appropriate less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The group recognises in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment the additions that are appropriate to capitalise and the subsequent costs of replacing the parts of such items when there are future economic benefits that will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset cost.
All other costs are recognised in the statement of income as an expense as they are incurred.
Depreciation is recognised in the statement of income on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful life.
The depreciation charge is revised where useful lives are different from previously estimated, or where technically obsolete assets are required to be written down.
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate lives, they are accounted for and depreciated as separate items.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold property 20 to 40 years Short leasehold property over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill The carrying amount of the groups assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The group currently has no such assets.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
21119.04 06 03 12 Proof 7 Financial Statements Governance Business Review 66 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount with the impairment loss recognised as an operating expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at their fair value and are subsequently reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Discounting is applied where it is expected to have a material impact.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell.
Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis or, in some cases, a weighted average basis is used if deemed more appropriate for the business.
Provision is made to write down slow-moving and obsolete items to net realisable value, based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of historic and projected usage with regard to quantities on hand.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the groups liability.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
Post-retirement benefits The group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of comprehensive income.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the statement of income.
Similarly, any cost or income relating to the curtailment or settlement of a pension scheme is recognised as a cost or income immediately in the statement of income.
For defined contribution schemes, the assets are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the statement of income as they fall due.
In certain countries, the group participates in industry-wide defined benefit-type pension arrangements.
In such circumstances, it is not possible to determine the amount of any surplus or deficit attributable to the group and the pension costs are accounted for as if the arrangements were defined contribution schemes.
These are not material to the group and accordingly no additional disclosures are provided.
21119.04 06 03 12 Proof 7 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 67 1.
Accounting policies continued Other long-term employee benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
Share-based payments The fair value of equity-settled employee share option grants is calculated at the grant date.
The resulting cost is charged to the statement of income over the vesting period of the plans.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Revenues Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts and excluding value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the statement of income when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, which is typically on delivery.
For contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the statement of income in proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of services rendered as at the balance sheet date.
This is assessed by reference to the amount of time incurred in proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver the service.
Occasionally, the initial contract covers both the supply of goods and ongoing support, servicing and maintenance.
For such contracts revenue is allocated across the components in line with their relative value and each element is accounted for as described above.
The group has an immaterial amount of activity accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts, and accordingly the applicable disclosures for these types of contracts are not provided.
Interest payable and receivable Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method.
Interest receivable is recognised in the statement of income as it accrues.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or statement of changes in equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.

Financial risk management The groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the group is managed.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
The group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The quantitative analysis of financial risk is included in Note 20. a Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the groups reporting currency of sterling translational exposures.
The group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the groups primary exposures relate to the US dollar, euro, Danish krone, Swiss franc and Japanese yen.
Where appropriate, the group manages its foreign currency exposures using derivative financial instruments.
The group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts.
Forward exchange contracts are typically used to hedge highly probable transactions which can be forecast to occur from anything between 1 and 18 months into the future.
The groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the statement of income and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the statement of income of overseas subsidiaries.
The group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the groups foreign currency subsidiaries.
The quantitative analysis of foreign currency risk is included in Note 20. b Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to manage the groups interest rate profile.
As at 31 December 2011 the majority of the groups borrowings attract floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and therefore the groups principal interest rate risk is a cash flow risk.
Quantitative analysis of interest rate risk is included in Note 20. c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the groups reputation.
The group manages this risk through the use of regularly updated cash flow and covenant compliance forecasts and a liquidity headroom analysis which is used to determine funding requirements.
Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high quality investment grade lenders.
The facilities committed to the group as at 31 December 2011 are set out in Note 19. d Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Quantitative analysis of credit risk to receivables is included in Note 17. Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed centrally by transacting with an existing relationship bank with strong investment grade rating.
Accordingly, the groups associated credit risk is limited.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the group balance sheet see Note 20.

Financial risk management continued Capital management The Board considers equity shareholders funds together with committed debt facilities as capital for the purposes of funding the groups operations.
Total managed capital at 31 December is: 2011 2010 m m Equity shareholders funds page 60 604.2 513.6 Committed debt facilities 500.9 229.5 1,105.1 743.1 Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the company.
This is carried out through a Save As You Earn option scheme in the UK, as well as Performance Share Plans.
Full details of these schemes are given in the Share-based payments note Note 25 of these accounts.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings, the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position and the benefits of an implied investment grade credit rating.
In line with this objective, the group financed its 2011 acquisitions from existing cash and a new US$550 million five-year revolving credit facility.
The main financial covenants in the companys debt facilities are the ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the ratio of finance charges to adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
At 31 December 2011 the company had, and is expected to continue to have, significant headroom under these financial covenant ratios.
From time to time the group purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There were no changes to the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Adjusted performance measures Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management has defined as amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisitionrelated costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory, profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 10.
Management has modified the definition of the adjusted performance measures to include acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory carried at fair value less cost to sell, to provide an adjusted profit measure that will include results from acquired businesses on a consistent basis over time to assist comparison of performance.
This adjustment was not material in the past.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.
The key features of share option contracts are described in Note 25.

Goodwill continued In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units which are represented by the groups trading businesses.
The most significant elements of the groups total consolidated goodwill of 544.5m at 31 December 2011 are allocated to PANalytical: 95.0m 2010: 97.7m, BTG: 53.6m 2010: 54.7m, HBM: 66.9m 2010: 72.3m, Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration: 73.2m 2010: 68.9m and Omega Engineering: 174.7m 2010: n a.
Except for Omega Engineering, the acquired entities are quickly integrated into existing group companies with the result that it is not appropriate to consider their individual performance when determining cash-generating units and performing goodwill impairment testing.
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is a specific indication of impairment.
Omega Engineering is a stand-alone entity which is operating separately within the Industrial Controls segment.
As such, it is being treated as a cash-generating unit for goodwill impairment testing.
For all cashgenerating units, there were no indications of impairment in 2011.
As part of the annual impairment test review, the carrying value of goodwill for all businesses excluding Omega Engineering has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity, reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year, and strategic review projections for 2013 and 2014.
For Omega Engineering the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to the acquisition business plan that assumed a sales growth in line with that anticipated for the rest of the Spectris group, margins consistent with recent history, certain synergies in procurement and sales channels and reduced working capital.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based for all businesses excluding Omega Engineering relate to business performance over the next three years, long-term growth rates beyond 2014 and the discount rates applied.
There are no individually significant business level cash flow assumptions in respect of any business that materially impact the impairment testing.
The key judgements are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
Growth rates for the period beyond 2014 are assumed to be 2.5% 2010: 2.5%, which is considered to be at or below long-term market trends for each business.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using entity-specific pre-tax discount rates between 13% and 18% 2010: 12% and 17%.
These rates have been determined by taking the size of business and specific geographic and industry risk factors into account.
No impairment charge has been required to be recognised in either 2011 or 2010.
The directors do not consider that there are any reasonable possible sensitivities for these businesses that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge arising.
For illustration, the directors have continued to consider the following specific individual sensitivities: a 2% increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each business would result in an impairment of nil 2010: nil : if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% no impairment would arise 2010: nil : and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25% for the next two years no impairment would arise 2010: nil.
The directors consider that operating results in 2011 confirm that none of the groups brought forward trading businesses have suffered permanent diminutions in value as a result of recent difficult economic conditions.
Reflecting the fact that it represents 32% of total goodwill, the directors consider the goodwill related to the Omega Engineering business to be individually significant and accordingly have provided additional commentary for this business.
The lowest level of headroom on goodwill impairment testing among the cash-generating units at 31 December 2011 is in respect of the Omega Engineering business, reflecting the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end.
However, having regard to trading activity post acquisition and the conservative assumptions built into the acquisition business case, the directors do not believe there is a significant risk of material impairment of goodwill arising in the next 12 months.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flows is 16% with a long-term growth rate assumption of 2.5% per annum and a longterm conversion of operating profit to cash of 90%.
Reflecting the highly dispersed customer base, wide range of industries served and extensive product list, no other individual assumptions have been identified that are material to this assessment.

The transfers from property, plant and equipment to software in 2010 relate to identifiable software assets.

Inventories 2011 2010 m m Raw materials 67.2 46.5 Work in progress 29.4 23.6 Finished goods 75.2 50.9 171.8 121.0 In the ordinary course of business, the group makes provision for slow-moving, excessand obsolete inventory as appropriate.
Inventory is stated after charging impairments of 1.6m 2010: 4.0m and crediting reversals of previous impairments of 1.7m 2010: 2.5m.
Impairments and reversals of impairments are included within operating profit.
The calculation of the groups inventory provision requires the use of various estimates and assumptions in relation to the impact of technology and market changes on future demand for on-hand inventory across a very large number of individual product lines.
Reversals of previous inventory provisions arise when these estimates prove pessimistic and actual product demand is higher than assumed.
This normally occurs when the product lifecycle is longer than anticipated.
There are no individually significant provision reversals.
The directors do not consider there to be significant levels of estimation risk in the determination of inventory provisions with regard to the total value of inventory.
Inventory carried at fair value less cost to sell is 19.2m 2010: 0.2m due to the acquisitions as described in Note 28.
In 2011, raw materials and changes in finished goods and work in progress recognised within cost of sales amounted to 301.4m 2010: 243.2m.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing.
Standard credit terms provided to customers differ according to business and country, and are typically between 30 and 60 days.
Trade receivables and other receivables are stated after net impairments recognised and utilised during the year of 4.5m 2010: 3.3m and reversals of impairments of 2.2m 2010: 1.4m.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as any disputes, or other factors delaying payment, and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historic collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
All trade receivables past due for more than 120 days have been fully provided in line with the groups credit risk policy.
There is no material unprovided risk in relation to EU countries.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

Secured bank loans Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these, 1.4m is denominated in Chinese renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.4m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.1m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes The interest rates on the unsecured loan notes are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any cross-currency interest rate swaps, and remain fixed until redemption.
On issue of the US$100m loan notes in October 2003, the group entered into a crosscurrency interest rate swap which has the effect of converting this US dollar borrowing into fixed interest euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
This interest rate remains fixed until redemption.
Under adopted IFRS, where cross-currency interest rate swaps are used, the value of the underlying US dollar borrowing is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial instruments in Note 20.
For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US dollar borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present values.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2011 is a net liability of 1.6m 2010: asset of 2.3m, of which 1.7m has been debited to the hedging reserve 2010: 1.9m credit and 0.1m credited to the statement of income 2010: 0.4m credit.
These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 15 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.

Financial instruments continued Cross-currency interest rate swaps The value of the groups cross-currency interest rate swaps can effectively be split into two components: a portion that is attributable to converting a 100m US dollar-denominated borrowing liability into a euro-denominated borrowing liability the currency portion the value of this portion changes as currency exchange rates change and a portion that is attributable to converting fixed rate US dollar interest payments into fixed rate euro interest payments the interest portion the value of this portion of the swap changes as US dollar variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates change.
Under adopted IFRS, the underlying US dollar borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the movements in the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.

However, the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US dollar borrowings in the statement of comprehensive income, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the statement of income within financing costs.
The groups US$75.6m borrowings have been designated as a net investment hedge of the groups net investment in its US businesses.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data and represents a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2011 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the groups profit before tax by approximately 2.2m 2010: increase of 0.5m.
Based on foreign exchange translational exposures for the year ended 31 December 2011 it is estimated that a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 4.5m 2010: 2.2m, a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the euro Danish krone against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 6.2m 2010: 2.9m and a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the Swiss franc against sterling would have decreased the groups profit before tax by approximately 2.2m 2010: 2.2m.
In addition, a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the groups net assets by approximately 48.8m and a ten percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the groups net assets by approximately 54.0m: exposures to other currencies are not considered to have a material impact on net assets.

Provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where the effect is significant, generally only where it is anticipated that a liability will crystallise in more than one year.
Provisions continued Reorganisation Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors best estimate of the cost to complete the restructuring.
Costs are expected to be incurred within one year and there is little judgement in determining the amount.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
These extended warranties are not significant.
The provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience and, barring significant unforeseen events, there is little judgement involved in determining the amount.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other comprises mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully, and therefore the possibility of any material outflow in settlement in excess of amounts provided is assessed as remote.

Deferred tax continued Unrecognised temporary differences Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the following temporary differences due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions.
There is no expiry date associated with losses.
2011 2010 m m Tax losses 23.1 29.0 Other temporary differences 9.0 9.6 32.1 38.6 The UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011 and a further reduction to 25% will take effect from 1 April 2012, being substantively enacted on 5 July 2011.
These rate reductions have had no material impact on the financial statements as at 31 December 2011.
A further phased reduction in the UK tax rate to 23% is planned but has not yet been substantively enacted.
No account will be taken of the expected further rate reduction until substantive enactment of these changes.
However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 23% the net impact on recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011 would not have been material.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK.
However, 34.9m 2010: 22.5m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 1.8m 2010: 1.2m, of which only 0.3m has been provided as the group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

Other reserves Movements in reserves are set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the company and treated as treasury shares see Note 27.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the groups own shares.

Share-based payments Under the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme.
The Executive Share Option Scheme and the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme were set up in order to provide executives and selected employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the company.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets.
Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum term of ten years.
Under the Performance Share Plan unapproved share options as defined by HMRC, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the companys shares.
Awards to Spectris plc executives and senior managers are subject to performance criteria: 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of an adjusted earnings growth target EPS and 50% subject to a total shareholder return target TSR.
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the groups operating companies in 2008 and 2009 have performance criteria subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award.
For awards made in 2010 and 2011, the performance criteria are EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award.
Operating company manager awards are entirely subject to operating company profit targets.
Awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting.
During 2011, Performance Share Plan options were granted that were approved share options as defined by HMRC.
The performance criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the unapproved options granted described above.

Share-based payments continued Share-based payment expense Share options are valued using a stochastic option pricing model, with support from an independent remuneration consultant.
The TSR performance condition was included in the calculation of fair value under the Performance Share Plan.

The fair values at the date of grant were 183p, 224p and 224p for the TSR, profit and EPS conditions, respectively.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected term.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The group recognised a total charge of 7.3m 2010: 7.3m in the statement of income, of which 6.4m 2010: 6.6m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Disposal of business On 1 January 2011, the group divested a sales operation in The Netherlands for a profit of 0.1m.
The total consideration was 0.1m net of transaction costs.
The group did not divest any businesses during 2010.
Treasury shares At 31 December 2011, the group held 8,634,064 treasury shares 2010: 9,073,760 : 439,696 of these shares were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the groups share schemes 2010: 419,815.
No shares were repurchased by the group during the year 2010: nil and no shares were cancelled during the year 2010: nil.
Acquisitions On 10 August 2011, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of IRM Group, a company based in Belgium, which extends the groups capabilities in measuring systems for the metals industry, for a consideration of 10.9m 6.7m net of cash acquired.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related mainly the benefits arising from the installed product base, technology, contractual rights and goodwill of 1.7m, 1.0m, 0.1m and 3.1m, respectively.
The goodwill arising is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and related know-how, and the ability to exploit Spectris know-how to further develop IRMs product offering and to expand IRMs routes to market.
This business has been integrated into the In-line Instrumentation segment.
On 30 September 2011, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Omega Engineering, a company based in the USA, which broadens Spectris range of process measurement and control instrumentation to customers in the industrial and academic markets, for a total consideration of 310.6m 297.1m net of cash acquired, including 3.0m deferred consideration and an expected working capital adjustment receivable from the seller of 7.1m.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related order backlog, contractual rights including supplier contracts and marketingrelated, trade names Omega and related brands, technology and goodwill of 0.6m, 3.0m, 63.3m, 28.7m and 174.1m, respectively.
The company sells a wide range of products to a large customer base of principally engineers across a broad group of industries.
The customer base has been developed through focused marketing and excellence in order fulfilment which has created a high degree of brand awareness and customer loyalty.
It is this brand loyalty together with the product base, rather than long-term customer supply agreements, that represents the source of customer orders.
Accordingly, the principal intangible assets identified are the Omega and related trade names which have strong profile and recognition, particularly in North America.
The goodwill arising is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and related know-how, and the benefits that will accrue as the company exploits Spectris global presence and knowledge of international markets to expand Omegas routes to market outside of North America.
This business has been integrated into the Industrial Controls segment.
On 5 October 2011, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Sixnet, a company based in the USA, which extends the groups capabilities in industrial networking products, for a total consideration of 47.4m 46.5m net of cash acquired, including 0.4m deferred consideration.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related order book and customer relationships, technology, other intangibles and goodwill of 16.9m, 6.4m, 0.1m and 18.6m, respectively.
The goodwill arising is considered to represent the value of the acquired workforce and related know-how, and the ability to use Spectris sales and distribution channels to expand Sixnets routes to markets both geographic and industry where it currently makes limited sales.
On 20 October 2011, the group acquired certain of the trade and assets of a company based in Finland which extends the groups capabilities in critical detector technology, for a total consideration of 8.1m, including 1.0m contingent on the future performance of the business.
No goodwill arose on the acquisition with the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired represented by technology-based intangibles of 7.6m.
This business has been integrated into the Materials Analysis segment.
The assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the above transactions, together with the aggregate purchase consideration, are summarised below.
The revenue and operating profit contribution from the acquisitions in the year to the groups results for the year were 36.3m and 7.5m, respectively.
Group revenue and operating profit would have been 1,218.2m and 189.4m adjusted operating profit: 226.8m, respectively, had each of these acquisitions taken place on the first day of the year.
On acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, the deferred and contingent consideration has been revised to reflect the increased earn-out payments amounting to 0.7m that were not accrued at 31 December 2010 and the decreased earn out payments amounting to 3.0m that were accrued at 31 December 2010 but are now not required with a corresponding decrease to goodwill of 1.7m.
The balance of 1.3m would have created a credit balance in goodwill and has thus been credited to the statement of income in line with IFRS 3 2004.
The group also paid 7.2m in respect of prior years acquisitions, which had been accrued as deferred or contingent consideration at 31 December 2010.
Acquisition-related costs of 3.1m have been recognised in the statement of income under IFRS 3 Revised and included within administrative expenses.
Acquisition-related costs and the credit arising on the reduction in deferred and contingent consideration have been excluded from the adjusted operating profit see Note 3.
