Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss In accordance with IFRS 7, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level.
The Groups financial assets that are measured and recognised at fair value include certificates of deposit, floating rate notes, fixed interest securities, UK treasury bills and life insurance policies.
The Groups financial liabilities that are measured and recognised at fair value include derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments is disclosed in note 20.
The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss: Group 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m m m m Certificates of deposit 9.8 9.8 19.3 19.3 Floating rate notes 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 Fixed interest securities 19.1 19.1 11.1 11.1 UK treasury bill 1.2 1.2 Life insurance policies 2.6 2.6 Marketable securities 22.3 12.4 34.7 13.1 19.3 32.4 Level 1 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms-length basis.
The quoted market price used by the Group is the mid-market price.
Level 2 financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates.
The fair value of certificates of deposit is calculated as the present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market rate of interest.
There have been no changes to the classification of financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments at 31 March 2011 or 2010.
