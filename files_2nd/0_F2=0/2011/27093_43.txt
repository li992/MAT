During the year the Company took out a new 40m three year fixed rate loan facility with Scotiabank Europe PLC and, on expiry, replaced its one year 40m multi-currency floating rate facility with Lloyds TSB with a similar 40m one year floating rate facility with Scotiabank Europe PLC.
Both of the Scotiabank Europe PLC facilities were fully drawn down in sterling at 30 April 2011.
Since March 2010, the Company has had in place a 30 year interest rate swap for 40m which locks in the rate banks charge to each other.
The net effect of the floating rate facility and the interest rate swap is that part of the cost of borrowings over the next thirty years has been locked in but the smaller element that is determined by the additional margin banks charge non-bank customers has only been fixed for a year: the effective interest rate at the year end on the floating rate loan swap is 5.1%.
More details on the interest rate swap are shown on page 48.
The main covenants relating to the loans are that total assets shall not fall below 550m and the ratio of adjusted total net assets to debt shall not exceed 3:1.
There were no breaches of loan covenants during the year.
