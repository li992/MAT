Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year, is set out below.
a Basis of accounting The consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by, or adopted by, the International Accounting Standards Board the IASB, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The consolidated accounts give a true and fair view and are also in compliance with The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The consolidated accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment property and derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the functional currency of the Company and presentational currency for the Company and the Group and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period.
The nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in the valuation of the investment properties held.
Further information on the valuation, market risk and sensitivity to market changes are provided in notes 9 and 18.
After making enquiries, and bearing in mind the nature of the Companys business and assets, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In assessing the going concern basis of accounting the Directors have had regard to the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
They have considered the current cash position of the Group, forecast rental income and other forecast cash flows.
The Group has agreements relating to its borrowing facilities with which it has complied during the year.
Based on this information the Directors believe that the Group has the ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the accounts.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the following new standards have been adopted in the current year: In May 2010, the IASB issued improvements to IFRS for 2010 which became effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
These covered eleven amendments to six standards, none of which materially affected the Group.
The following new standards have been issued but are not effective for this accounting period and have not been adopted early: In October 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 2010 FinancialInstruments which, following an amendment in December 2011, becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.
This represents part of a project to replace IAS 39 FinancialInstruments:.
The objective of the standard is to enhance the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting of financial assets and to reduce complexity.
In June 2011, the IASB  Amendments to IAS 1 .
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income.
Items that could be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time would be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified.
The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
In December 2010, the IASB issued DeferredTax: Amendments to IAS 12Income Taxes.
The amendment clarified the determination of deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value.
The amendment introduces a rebuttable presumption that deferred tax on investment property measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 should be determined on the basis that its carrying amount will be recovered through sale.
Furthermore, it introduces the requirement that deferred tax on non-depreciable assets that are measured using the revaluation model in IAS 16 should always be measured on a sale basis on the asset.
The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
Accounting policies continued a Basis of accounting continued In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 .
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities.
The changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled and therefore are required to be consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27.
This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 12 .
IFRS 12 includes all the disclosures which were previously required by IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28.
These disclosures relate to an entitys interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities.
A number of new disclosures are also required.
As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12 above, what remains of IAS 27  2011 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate financial statements.
The Group does not present separate financial statements.
The amendment becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 13 FairValueMeasurement.
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
This standard becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The Group does not consider that the future adoption of any new standards, in the form currently available, will have any material impact on the financial statements as presented.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are those entities, including special purpose entities, controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of FCPT Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey which was, until the group reconstruction in 2009, the top company in the group structure.
The principal activity of FCPT Holdings Limited is now to act as a holding company and it owns 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of SCP Estate Holdings Limited, a company registered in Guernsey.
The principal activity of SCP Estate Holdings Limited is to act as a holding company and it owns 100 per cent of the ordinary share capital of SCP Estate Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Winchester Burma Limited, a company registered in Guernsey whose principal business is that of an investment and property company.
The Company owns 100 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Accede Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales.
At 31 December 2011 this Company was dormant, having acted as an investment and property company during the year.
The Group also consolidates the results of F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Guernsey to issue the interest-bearing bonds.
F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited has the same board of directors as the Company and the Company has the majority of the risks and rewards associated with the vehicle.
F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited is therefore consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary under common control.
c Revenue recognition Rental income, excluding VAT, arising on investment properties is accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term of ongoing leases.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
The Group from time to time receives surrender premiums from tenants who break their leases early.
To the extent they are deemed capital receipts to compensate the Group for loss in value of property to which they relate, they are credited to capital reserve investments held.
All other surrender premiums are recognised within rental income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 35 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued c Revenue recognition continued Distribution income received from any indirect property funds is recognised on the date the Group becomes entitled to the distribution and recorded separately from any unrealised or realised gains or losses on revaluation of indirect property funds.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The Groups investment management and administration fees, finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Taxation The tax credit expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit loss before taxation reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As the Directors consider the value of the property portfolio is likely to be realised by sale rather than use over time, and that no charge to Guernsey or United Kingdom taxation will arise on capital gains, no provision has been made for deferred tax on valuation uplifts.
f Investment properties Investment properties consist of land and buildings held to earn rental income together with the potential for capital and income growth.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including associated transaction costs.
Any subsequent capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period during which the expenditure is incurred and included within the book cost of the properties.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Held.
Fair value is based on the Market Value provided by CBRE Limited, Registered Valuers, at the balance sheet date using recognised valuation techniques.
These techniques comprise both the Yield Method and the Discounted Cash Flow Method.
In some cases, the fair values are determined based on recent real estate transactions with similar characteristics and location to those of the Companys assets.
For the purposes of these financial statements, in order to prevent double accounting, the assessed market value is reduced by the carrying amount of any accrued income resulting from the spreading of lease incentives and or minimum lease payments.
The determination of the market value of investment properties requires the use of estimates such as future cash flows from assets such as lettings, tenants profiles, future revenue streams, capital values of fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery, any environmental matters and the overall repair and condition of the property and discount rates applicable to those assets.
In addition, development risks such as construction and letting risks are also taken into consideration when determining the market value of investment properties under construction.
These estimates are based on local market conditions existing at the balance sheet date.
Techniques used for valuing investment properties The Traditional Method converts anticipated future cash flow benefits in the form of rental income into present value.
This approach requires careful estimation of future benefits and application of investor yield or return requirements.
One approach to value the property on this basis is to capitalise net rental income on the basis of an Initial Yield, generally referred to as the All Risks Yield approach or Net Initial Yield approach.
The Discounted Cash Flow Method involves the projection of a series of periodic cash flows either to an operating property or a development property.
To this projected cash flow series an appropriate market-derived discount rate is applied to establish an indication of the present value of the income stream associated with the property.
The calculated periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy and collection losses and operating expenses outgoings.
A series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the reversion terminal exit value which uses the traditional valuation approach anticipated at the end of the projection period, are discounted to present value.
The aggregate of the net present values equals the market value of the property.
Investment properties held under finance leases and leased out under operating leases are classified as investment properties and stated at fair value.
Accounting policies continued f Investment properties continued On derecognition, realised gains and losses on disposals of investment properties are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and transferred to the Capital Reserve Investments Sold.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the completion of a sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
g Investments Investments in any unquoted indirect property funds are recognised and derecognised on the trade date, and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments in any unquoted indirect property funds are financial instruments and are classified on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss given that their fair value can be reliably determined based on the criteria set out in IAS 39.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
The classification of financial instruments depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows: Level 1 Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Examples of such instruments would be investments listed or quoted on any recognised stock exchange.
The Group held no such securities during the year under review.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of investment.
Examples of such instruments would be those for which the quoted price has been suspended, forward exchange contracts and certain other derivative instruments.
The interest rate swap entered into to hedge the interest rate on the 50 million bank loan is included in Level 2.
Level 3 External inputs are unobservable.
Value is the Directors best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar instrument.
Any investments in indirect property funds would be included in Level 3. h Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised in the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
Fair value is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Transaction costs are expensed immediately.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of cash flow hedges in the form of derivative instruments are taken directly to Other Comprehensive Income.
Such gains and losses are taken to the Hedging Reserve.
On maturity or early redemption the unrealised gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in the form of derivative instruments, initially recognised in Other Comprehensive Income, are reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group considers that its interest rate swap qualifies for hedge accounting when the following criteria are satisfied: The instrument must be related to an asset or liability: It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa: It must match the principal amounts and maturity date of the hedged item: and As a cash-flow hedge the forecast transaction incurring interest payable on the bank loan that is subject to the hedge must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect the profit or loss.
The effectiveness of the hedge must be capable of reliable measurement and must be assessed as highly effective on an ongoing basis throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
i Operating segments The Board has considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The Board is of the view that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being property investment, and in one geographical area, the United Kingdom, and that therefore the Group has only a single operating segment.
The Board of Directors, as a whole, has been identified as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the Group.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Groups performance is the total return on the Groups net asset value.
As the total return on the Groups net asset value is calculated based on the net asset value per share calculated under IFRS as shown at the foot of the Balance Sheet, assuming dividends are re-invested, the key performance measure is that prepared under IFRS.
Therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the financial statements.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash in banks and short-term deposits are carried at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and short-term deposits in banks with an original maturity of three months or less.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued k Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which are generally due for settlement at the relevant quarter end, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Reverse lease premia and other capital incentives paid to tenants are recognised as a current asset and amortised over the period from the date of lease commencement to the earliest termination date.
l Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Fees 000 000 a Investment management fee base management fee 3,295 4,594 performance fee 2,432 3,543 5,727 8,137 Throughout the year the Groups investment manager was F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of F&C Asset Management plc.
The property management arrangements of the Group have been delegated by FCIB, with the approval of the Company, to F&C REIT Property Asset Management plc, which is also part of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
FCIB is entitled to a base management fee of 0.50 per cent per annum of the Groups net assets and reduced to 0.25 per cent per annum on cash net of gearing in excess of 5 per cent of net assets, payable quarterly in arrears.
Until 30 September 2010, FCIB was entitled to a base management fee of 0.60 per cent per annum of the Groups invested assets including indirect property holdings and 0.25 per cent per annum of the net current assets.
The fees of any managing agents appointed by the investment manager are payable out of the management fee.
FCIB is also entitled to a performance fee equal to 20 per cent of the amount by which the total return whether positive or negative on the directly held properties exceeds 110 per cent of the total return 90 per cent if the total return is negative on the benchmark and multiplied by the Groups average total assets excluding any indirect property holdings.
The benchmark for measuring the comparative performance of directly held properties is the total return from the IPD All Quarterly and Monthly Valued Funds.
The performance fee payable in each financial year is capped at an amount which, when taken with the aggregate base management fee payable in each financial year, equals 0.60 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
Until 30 September 2010 this capped amount was 1.0 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
Performance fees in excess of this capped return can be carried forward for up to two subsequent financial years subject to the annual 0.60 per cent cap.
The performance fee is measured over a rolling three year period and the performance fee payable in respect of any one financial year is equal to the total performance fee earned over that three year period less any performance fees already paid in the previous two years.
In the event that the amount already paid in the previous two years is in excess of the amount earned over the rolling three year period, such excess shall be repaid to the Group by FCIB.
The performance fee was rebased as at 1 October 2010.
The Managers agreed to waive the carry forward of the excess out-performance as at 30 September 2010 and the performance fees paid to that date do not fall subject to potential repayment to the Group by FCIB.
The performance fee is accrued based on the relative performance of the directly held properties at the balance sheet date up to a maximum of the capped amount in any financial year.
No recognition is made of any excess paid by the Group in the previous two years until the Groups entitlement to any repayment is certain.
FCIB is also entitled to an administration fee which is payable quarterly in arrears.
It received 130,000 for administration services provided in respect of the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: 118,000.
The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party by giving not less than six months notice.
The agreement may be terminated earlier provided that a payment in lieu of notice, equivalent to the amount the investment manager would otherwise have received during the notice period, is made.
Fees continued b Valuers fees The valuers of the investment properties, CBRE Limited, have agreed to provide valuation services in respect of the property portfolio.
The valuation agreement is for a fixed term up to 30 September 2014 and an annual fee is payable equal to 0.01 per cent of the aggregate value of the direct property portfolio.
Other expenses 2011 2010 000 000 Direct operating expenses of let rental property 3,865 2,763 Valuation and other professional fees 602 609 Directors fees 232 245 Administration fee 130 118 Auditors remuneration for: statutory audit 60 59 audit-related services ` 14 13 Merger abort costs 893 Other 250 318 5,153 5,018 An analysis of the Directors fees is provided in the Directors Emoluments for the Year table within the Directors Remuneration Report on page 27.
The prior year includes 75,000 of fees relating to additional work undertaken in relation to the aborted merger.
`In the prior year additional fees of 79,000 paid to the Companys auditor were included within the merger abort costs.
The costs of 893,000 incurred in 2010 represent the Companys share of the total merger abort costs.
Finance costs 2011 2010 000 000 Interest on the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 12,151 12,145 Interest on the interest-bearing bank loan 1,513 746 Interest in respect of the interest rate swap agreement 1,041 559 14,705 13,450 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Notes to the Accounts continued 6.

A fixed annual fee of 600 per company is payable to the States of Guernsey in respect of this exemption.
No charge to Guernsey taxation will arise on capital gains.
At 31 December 2011, the Group provided for deferred tax at the rate of Guernsey tax zero per cent expected to apply on recovery of the carrying amount of its assets through sale.
The Directors intend to conduct the Groups affairs such that management and control is not exercised in the United Kingdom and so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries carries on any trade in the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, the Company and its subsidiaries will not be liable for United Kingdom taxation on their income or gains other than certain income deriving from a United Kingdom source.
The Group had unutilised tax losses carried forward of 2,762,000 2010: 6,894,000 at 31 December 2011.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is uncertain that there will be taxable profits arising within the relevant subsidiary from which the future reversal of the deferred tax asset could be deducted.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United Kingdom income tax on income arising on the property portfolio after deduction of its allowable debt financing costs and other allowable expenses.

The twelfth, and last, interim dividend in respect of the year, of 0.5p per share, will be paid on 27 April 2012 to shareholders on the register on 13 April 2012.
Although these payments relate to the year ended 31 December 2011, under IFRS they will be accounted for in the year ending 31 December 2012, being the period during which they are paid.
It is the Directors intention that the Company will continue to pay dividends monthly.
Earnings per share The Groups basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the profit for the year of 73,665,000 2010: 106,914,000 and on 680,537,003 2010: 680,537,003 Ordinary Shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

All such valuers are Chartered Surveyors, being members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS.
CBRE completed the valuation of the Groups investment properties at 31 December 2011 on a market value basis and in accordance with RICS Valuation Standards, Seventh Edition.
Market value is the amount for which the assets could be exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2011 consists of capital incentives paid to tenants totalling 3,760,000 and accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 4,202,000, both of which are separately recorded in the accounts as current assets.
The CBRE valuation report is dated 30 January 2012 the Valuation Report.
The Valuation Report is signed by David M. Tudor, MRICS.
CBRE and its predecessor firms have not previously carried out valuation instructions for the Group.
In the prior year all of the Groups investment properties were valued by qualified professional valuers working for the company of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung DTZ, Chartered Surveyors.
CBRE also values properties held by other companies for which the F&C Asset Management plc group is also the investment manager.
CBRE provides, and has provided in the past, ad hoc investment and occupational agency advice, landlord and tenant and building consultancy advice to members of the F&C Asset Management plc group.
The proportion of total fees payable by the F&C Asset Management plc group to the total fee income of CBRE was less than 5 per cent of total UK revenues.
All leasehold properties are carried at fair value rather than amortised over the term of the lease.
The same valuation criteria are therefore applied to leasehold as freehold properties.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
Investments continued The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation, when the Managers advise the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 20 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All of the properties per open market value band are shown on page 15.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise as described in Liquidity Risk in note 18.
Other than the capital commitments disclosed in note 19, the Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of leases are on a full repairing basis and, as such, the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to those investment properties.

The bonds carry interest at a fixed rate of 5.23 per cent per annum and have an expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.60 per cent over six-month LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
These bonds are secured by means of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of the Secured Group which comprises FCPT Holdings Limited, F&C Commercial Property Holdings Limited and F&C Commercial Property Finance Limited.
Under the covenant relating to the bonds the Company is to ensure that for the Secured Group: the loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 50 per cent defined as financial indebtedness expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the secured loan to value percentage remains less than, or equal to, 40 per cent defined as the principal amount outstanding on the bonds expressed as a percentage of gross secured asset value : the interest cover ratio is greater than 1.5 times on any calculation date: payments are not made in respect of shares unless the ratio of free cash flow to interest is greater than 2.0 times and, after deduction of an amount equal to the proposed payment, greater than 1.75 times: no single property measured by market value accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross asset value: the sector weightings measured by market value do not exceed the following percentages of the gross asset value: All industrial: 40 per cent: All office: 50 per cent: All retail: 65 per cent: the five largest properties measured by market value do not exceed 40 per cent of the gross asset value: no single tenant exceeds 15 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: the five largest tenants do not exceed 40 per cent of the total annual net rental income from the properties: and short leasehold properties measured by market value do not exceed 10 per cent of the gross asset value.
The Secured Group has complied with all the bond covenants during the year.
The fair value of the interest-bearing bonds based on mid-market price at 31 December 2011 was 239,391,000 2010: 236,555,000.
Bank loan and interest rate swap liability 2011 2010 000 000 Principal amount outstanding 50,000 50,000 Set-up costs 727 727 Amortisation of set-up costs 179 56 49,452 49,329 The Group has a 50 million facility with Barclays Bank plc Barclays which remained fully drawn throughout the year.
The loan facility is repayable on 28 June 2017.
Interest accrues on the bank loan at a variable rate, based on 3 month LIBOR plus margin and mandatory lending costs and is payable quarterly.
The margin is 1.95 per cent per annum for the duration of the loan.
The bank loan is secured by way of a fixed and floating charge over the whole of the assets of SCP Estate Holdings Limited and SCP Estate Limited the SCP Group, whose assets consist mainly of the properties held at St. Christophers Place Estate, London W1.
In addition, the SCP Group has granted security to Barclays pursuant to Guernsey security interest agreements over bank accounts and shares.
Under the bank covenants related to the loan, the Company is to ensure that for the SCP Group: the loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent: and the interest cover is greater than 1.4 times on any calculation date.
The SCP Group has complied with all the bank loan covenants during the year.
Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of an interest rate swap contract.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swap with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed above but excluding the margin and payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 2.9265 per cent per annum.
The interest rate swap is due to expire on 28 June 2017.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2011 was 4,060,000 2010: 389,000, which is based on the marked to market value.
The interest rate swap is classified as Level 2 under the hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments required by IFRS 7 revised.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45 Notes to the Accounts continued 15.
Share capital and reserves continued Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of any shares repurchased for cancellation by the Company is taken to this reserve.
The balance on this account at the time of the Group reconstruction in July 2009 was transferred to the Reverse Acquisition Reserve.
Reverse acquisition reserve Created as a result of the Group reconstruction in July 2009 to reflect the difference arising between the total of the issued share capital including the Capital Redemption Reserve immediately before and after the reconstruction.
Special reserve The Special Reserve was created by the cancellation of FCPT Holdings Limiteds Share Premium Account by the Royal Court of Guernsey in July 2005 and a subsequent smaller cancellation in March 2008.
In addition, approval of the Royal Court of Guernsey was received in March 2008 to reduce the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares from 90p to 1p, resulting in an amount of 679.6 million being transferred from Share Capital to the Special Reserve.
It is a distributable reserve to be used for all purposes permitted under Guernsey law, including the buy back of shares and the payment of dividends.
The costs of the Group reconstruction during 2009 which related directly to the issue of new Ordinary Shares were charged to the Special Reserve.
Capital reserve investments sold The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments and investment properties, including the transfer of any unrealised gains now realised which were previously recognised through Capital Reserve Investments Held: and the buy back of shares up to the balance on this reserve, thereafter any buy back of shares is charged to the Special Reserve.
Capital reserve investments held The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the fair value of investment properties held at the year end: and increases and decreases in the fair value of any investments in indirect property funds held at the year end.
Hedging reserve Movements relating to the interest rate swap arrangement accounted for as a cash flow hedge are recognised in this reserve.
Revenue reserve Any surplus arising from the profit after taxation after payment of dividends is taken to this reserve, with any deficit up to the level of the special reserve being transferred from that reserve.
Capital management The Groups capital is represented by the Ordinary Shares, Capital Redemption Reserve, Reverse Acquisition Reserve, Special Reserve, Capital Reserve Investments Sold, Capital Reserve Investments Held, Hedging Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
The Group is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Group is managed in accordance with its investment policy, in pursuit of its investment objective.
Capital management activities may include the allotment of new shares, the buyback or re-issuance of shares from treasury, the management of the Groups discount to net asset value and consideration of the Groups net gearing level.
Net asset value per share The Groups net asset value per Ordinary Share of 100.5p 2010: 96.3p is based on equity shareholders funds of 684,243,000 2010: 655,081,000 and on 680,537,003 2010: 680,537,003 Ordinary Shares, being the number of shares in issue at the year end.
Related party transactions The Directors are considered to be the Groups key management personnel.
No Director has an interest in any transactions which are, or were, unusual in their nature or significant to the nature of the Group.
At 31 December 2011 Resolution Limited, through a number of subsidiaries, owned 34.1 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital 2010: 34.1 per cent.
The Directors consider Resolution Limited to be a related party of the Company.
Mr P Niven, a non-executive Director of the Company, is also an independent non-executive director of Resolution Limited.

No fees remained payable at the year end.
Financial instruments The Companys investment objective is to provide ordinary shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for capital and income growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
In addition, the Groups financial instruments comprise interest-bearing bonds, an interest-bearing bank loan, cash and receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not have exposure to any derivative instruments other than the interest rate swap entered into to hedge the interest paid on the interest-bearing bank loan.
The Group is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with financial instruments.
The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market price risk.
There is no foreign currency risk as all assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Groups risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and have remained unchanged for the year under review.
These disclosures include, where appropriate, consideration of the Groups investment properties which, whilst not constituting financial instruments as defined by IFRS, are considered by the Board to be integral to the Groups overall risk exposure.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Managers monitor such reports in order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The Group has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2011 was 534,000 2010: 1,904,000.
As at 31 December 2011, rent receivable of 221,000 that was greater than three months overdue was fully provided for.
As at 31 December 2010 the provision was 529,000.
Of this amount 245,000 was subsequently written off, 35,000 is still outstanding and 249,000 was recovered.
Apart from the rent receivable disclosed above there were no financial assets which were either past due or considered impaired at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
All of the Groups cash is placed with financial institutions with a long-term credit rating of A or better.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial institutions may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank.
During the year and the prior year, due to the quantum of cash balances held, counterparty risk was spread by placing cash across a number of different financial institutions.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
The Groups investments comprise UK commercial property.
Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public market and may be illiquid.
As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Managers and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk the Group aims to have sufficient cash balances including the expected proceeds of any property sales to meet its obligations for a period of at least twelve months.
At the reporting date, the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were on a contractual maturity basis : Within More than one year 12 years 25 years 5 years Total Financial assets 000 000 000 000 000 As at 31 December 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 49,822 49,822 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,461 2,461 Rents receivable 534 534 As at 31 December 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 109,442 109,442 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,136 2,136 Rents receivable 1,904 1,904 Financial liabilities As at 31 December 2011 Trade and other payables 18,301 18,301 Interest-bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 248,044 272,102 Interest-bearing bank loan and interest rate swap 2,438 2,438 7,315 51,219 63,410 As at 31 December 2010 Trade and other payables 17,735 17,735 Interest-bearing bonds 12,029 12,029 260,073 284,131 Interest-bearing bank loan and interest rate swap 2,438 2,438 7,315 53,657 65,848 The table above details the total payment due to Barclays, combining the interest-bearing bank loan and interest rate swap, as this total amount is known with certainty.
The exact amount attributable to each of the interest-bearing bank loan and the interest rate swap will vary depending on the rate of 3 month LIBOR over the instruments duration.
The terms of both the interest-bearing bank loan and the interest rate swap are detailed in note 14.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups listed bonds interest-bearing bank loan entitle the bondholders bank to require early repayment and, in such circumstances, the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected.
The Groups investments may, from time to time, include investments in indirect property funds which are not traded in an organised public market and which generally may be illiquid.
As a result, similar to the directly-held properties, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments in those instruments in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group did not hold any investments in indirect property funds 2010: nil.
Interest rate risk Some of the Groups financial instruments are interest-bearing.
They are a mix of both fixed and variable rate instruments with differing maturities.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate risk on long-term debt obligations is managed by fixing the interest rate on such borrowings, either directly or through an interest rate swap for the same notional value and duration.
Long-term debt obligations and the interest rate risk they confer to the Group is considered by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Long-term debt obligations consist of 230 million Secured Bonds due 2017 on which the rate has been fixed at 5.23 per cent until the expected maturity date of 30 June 2015.
If the bonds are not redeemed at this date they will carry interest at 0.6 per cent over LIBOR until the final maturity date of 30 June 2017.
The Group also has a 50 million interest-bearing bank loan on which the rate has been fixed through an interest rate swap at 4.8765 per cent until the maturity date of 28 June 2017.
Financial instruments continued The following table sets out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: Assets Weighted liabilities Weighted average where no average period for Fixed Variable interest is interest which rate Total rate rate received rate is fixed Type 000 000 000 000 % years As at 31 December 2011 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 49,822 35,391 14,431 0.78 0.1 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,461 2,461 Rents receivable 534 534 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,546 229,546 5.29 3.5 Bank loan and interest rate swap 53,512 53,512 4.88 5.5 As at 31 December 2010 Financialassets Cash and cash equivalents 109,442 63,669 45,773 0.55 0.1 Cash deposits held for tenants 2,136 2,136 Rents receivable 1,904 1,904 Financialliabilities 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds due 2017 229,424 229,424 5.29 4.5 Bank loan and interest rate swap 49,718 49,718 4.88 6.5 Apart from the 5.23 per cent Secured Bonds as disclosed in note 13, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value in the financial statements.
Considering the effect on the Secured Bonds, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 10,872,000 2010: 13,313,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 11,584,000 2010: 14,372,000.
The carrying value of the Secured Bonds in the financial statements would have remained unchanged.
Considering the effect of the bank loan and interest rate swap combined, it is estimated that an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates as at the balance sheet date would have decreased their fair value by approximately 3,692,000 2010: 3,876,000, and a decrease of 150 basis points would have increased their fair value by approximately 4,044,000 2010: 4,294,000.
The carrying value of the interest rate swap in the financial statements would have been adjusted by these amounts, thereby increasing decreasing net assets and income for the year.
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts.
The benchmark which determines the interest income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate which was 0.5 per cent as at 31 December 2011 2010: 0.5 per cent.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate or short-term fixed rate bank accounts and not usually in fixed rate securities with a term greater than three months.
Considering the effect on cash balances, an increase of 150 basis points in interest rates would have increased net assets and income for the year by 747,000 2010: 1,642,000.
A decrease of 150 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates.
Market price risk The Groups strategy for the management of market price risk is driven by the investment policy as outlined within the Report of the Directors on pages 17 and 18.
The management of market price risk is part of the investment management process and is typical of commercial property investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements through detailed and continuing analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
Such risk is minimised through the appointment of external property valuers.
The basis of valuation of the property portfolio is set out in detail in the accounting policies and note 9.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 49 Notes to the Accounts continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Market price risk continued The Group may also hold investments in indirect property funds including listed property companies which in turn invest directly in commercial property.
In addition to the price risk attaching to the underlying assets, such funds also carry the risk that the investment cannot be disposed of at its net asset value due to a lack of liquidity.
The Company did not hold any investments in indirect property funds at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Details of the Groups investment property portfolio held at the balance sheet date are disclosed on page 15.
A 15 per cent increase in the fair value of the direct properties at 31 December 2011 would have increased net assets and income for the year by 138,687,000 2010: 124,800,000.
A decrease of 15 per cent would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The calculations above are based on the investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Capital commitments The Group had capital commitments totalling 28,236,000 as at 31 December 2011 2010: 11,585,000.
These commitments related mainly to development work at Winchester, Burma Road and Camberley, Watchmoor Park.
Lease length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The total future income based on the unexpired lessor lease length at the year end was as follows based on annual rentals : 2011 2010 000 000 Less than one year 54,960 53,403 Between two and five years 172,906 167,112 Over five years 153,374 150,389 Total 381,240 370,904 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 5.4 per cent 2010: 4.9 per cent of the current annual rental income.
Unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of estimated total rental value excluding properties under development was 6.0 per cent 2010: 2.6 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of more than 5 years.
Post balance sheet event On 26 January 2012, the Company issued 14,750,000 Ordinary Shares, raising gross proceeds of 15,253,000.
