They will no longer result in goodwill effective from 1 July 2009 or gains and losses.
The amended standard also speci es the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in pro t or loss.
The impact of this on the results presented has not been signi cant.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Harmonises business combination accounting with US GAAP.
The amended standard amendment effective from 1 July 2009 will continue to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with certain signi cant changes.
All payments to purchase a business will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through income.
Goodwill and non-controlling minority interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis.
All transaction costs will be expensed.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations, which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 29 January 2011, are either not currently relevant or material for the Group: IAS 39 amendment, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement Eligible hedged items: Improvements to IFRSs 2009: IFRS 1 revised November 2008, First-time adoption of IFRS: IFRS 2 amendment, Share-based payments Group cash-settled payment transactions: IFRIC 17, Distributions of non-cash assets to owners: and IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers.

For certain liabilities held at fair value, gains recognised on reduction in the fair value of these liabilities are to be recognised through other comprehensive income rather than in pro t and loss.
This is still subject to endorsement by the European Union, but is currently expected to be applied in the Groups 2013 14 financial statements.

Tax on exceptional items for the year is a credit of 3m, all of which relates to current year items.
In 2009 10 tax on exceptional items was a charge of 7m, all of which related to current year items.
The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the Financial review on page 22.
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of 33m has been charged directly to equity 2009 10: 55m credit, of which a 5m credit 2009 10: 12m credit is included in current tax and a 38m charge 2009 10: 43m credit is included in deferred tax.
The revised comparatives in the income tax expense table above re ect a reassessment of balances expected to be settled on behalf of UK and overseas operating companies.
King sher paid 138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
King sher appealed against this tax liability and the tribunal found in favour of King sher in June 2009.
As a result, on 7 September 2009 the Group received 169m 148m from the French tax authorities, representing a refund of the 138m and 31m of repayment supplement.
The French tax authorities have appealed against this decision and the appeal court hearing date is awaited.
No income has therefore been recognised in respect of this receipt.

The groups of CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed signi cant are the UK and France.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below: Assumptions The cash ow projections are based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like LFL sales, margin and operating pro t percentage.
LFL sales are based on the Groups market expectations and the CGUs market shares.
Cash ows beyond this five year period are calculated using a growth rate of 1.9% 2009 10: 1.9% which does not exceed the long term average growth rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs.
Working capital movements are included in the model, building in anticipated movements due to the level of trading and including reductions across the Group as part of the Delivering Value programme over the first three years.
The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash ows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt and the cost of equity balanced according to the Groups level of financial gearing.
A risk adjustment is then made for the country in which the CGU operates.

Bank overdrafts are arranged at oating rates of interest.
Current bank loans include Chinese Renminbi loans drawn under committed and uncommitted facilities expiring in July 2013 and July 2011 respectively.
These loans bear interest based on the Peoples Bank of China reference rate and are xed for periods of up to six months.
At the year end the effective borrowing rate on the drawn amounts was 4.8%.
Other current bank loans are arranged at oating rates of interest.
Non-current bank loans have an average maturity of two years 2009 10: two years and are arranged at xed rates of interest with an effective interest rate of 4.3% 2009 10: 6.1%.
There has been a reduction in the level of bank loans in China during the year.

The Group values its MTNs and USPP on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for fair value gains and losses based on observable market inputs attributable to the risk being hedged in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships.
The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exchange rate movements and fair value adjustments for interest rate risk.
At 29 January 2011, the cumulative effect of interest rate fair value adjustments is to increase the Groups MTNs and USPP carrying amounts by 44m 2009 10: 70m.
The USPP contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating pro t to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period.
The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 29 January 2011.
Finance leases The Group leases certain of its buildings and xtures and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term maturity for buildings is seven years 2009 10: seven years and for xtures and equipment is two years 2009 10: two years.
Certain building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 Present Present value of Minimum value of Minimum millions payments payments payments payments Less than one year 12 16 12 16 One to five years 30 42 27 36 More than five years 28 41 26 43 Total 70 99 65 95 Less amounts representing finance charges 29 30 Present value of minimum lease payments 70 65 The interest rates inherent in the finance leases are xed at the contract date for the lease term.

Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amounts and fair values of non-current borrowings are as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair millions amount value amount value Bank loans 15 15 18 17 Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt 504 511 812 820 Finance leases 58 75 53 75 577 601 883 912 Assets worth RMB 1.2bn 115m secure a bank facility in China, which matures in July 2013 2009 10: RMB 1.2bn.

These fair value measurements are all made using observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk and are therefore classi ed as level 2 in the IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, fair value hierarchy.
At 29 January 2011 net derivative assets included in net debt cash amount to 56m 2009 10: 20m net derivative assets.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges comprise interest rate swap contracts that convert xed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme and the US Private Placement to oating rate liabilities, along with certain cross-currency swaps.
At 29 January 2011 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 537m 2009 10: 984m.
During the year, interest rate swaps have been cancelled as a result of repayments or repurchases of underlying debt.
The Sterling equivalent amount of those cancellations at year end exchange rates was 551m.
Cash ow hedges Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases.
At 29 January 2011 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 279m 2009 10: 264m.
The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months.
Gains of 14m 2009 10: 5m gains have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Net investment hedges Cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments.
At 29 January 2011 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 48m 2009 10: 138m.
Non-designated hedges The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 29 January 2011 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 1,038m 2009 10: 1,100m.
These have not been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet positions.
These include short term foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has reviewed all signi cant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.

The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
King shers treasury function is not run as a pro t centre and does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives.
The main types of financial instruments used are Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk Borrowings arranged at oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at xed rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other xed term debt.
Currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi.
The Euro, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland, Poland and China.
Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Groups debt in Euro, whilst Chinese Renminbi balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling.
In addition, the Group has signi cant transactional exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
King shers policy is to manage the interest rate and currency pro le of its issued debt using derivative contracts.
The effect of these contracts on the Groups net debt cash is as follows: Sterling Euro US Dollar Other millions Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Total At 29 January 2011 Net cash before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 162 38 193 442 187 2 50 12 2 Fair value adjustments to net cash 10 5 29 44 Financing derivatives 259 1,257 178 187 216 226 247 56 Net cash 87 1,219 20 629 228 50 259 14 At 30 January 2010 Net debt before fair value adjustments and nancing derivatives 371 357 541 536 289 32 57 19 200 Fair value adjustments to net debt 22 11 37 70 Financing derivatives 353 1,249 394 31 327 129 97 20 Net debt 40 892 158 505 1 161 57 116 250 Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the signi cant market risks impacting King sher, are borrowings, deposits and derivatives.

The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur.
See note 23 for further details.
The retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is reported in equity, but offset by the retranslation of the hedged net investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax.
It has been prepared on the basis that the Groups debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain constant, re ecting the positions at 29 January 2011 and 30 January 2010 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
In preparing the sensitivity analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Liquidity risk The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities.
This involves preparing a prudent cash ow forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected out ows.
The following table analyses the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
It excludes trade and other payables due to the low associated liquidity risk.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows including interest and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

The 500m facility contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating pro t to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period.
indd 82 82 14 4 11 14 4 11 12:23:46 12:23:46 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 83 2010 11 Credit risk The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with strong credit ratings and with money market funds which have the strongest, AAA, credit rating and offer same day liquidity.
A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts across several counterparties.
At 29 January 2011, the highest cash deposit with a single counterparty was 86m 2009 10: 101m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short term deposits and the fair value of derivative assets.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables.
Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances with short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers.
At 29 January 2011, trade and other receivables that are past due but not provided against amount to 34m 2009 10: 29m, of which 3m 2009 10: 4m are over 120 days past due.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 4m 2009 10: 7m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 264m 2009 10: 309m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of 213m 2009 10: 245m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 21m 2009 10: 27m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Earnings which could be remitted on which there would be tax to pay total 99m 2009 10: 91m.

The provisions are based on the present value of future cash out ows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK and China restructuring programmes.
The provisions have been discounted to re ect the time value of money and the risks associated with the speci c liabilities.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash ows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease contracts and subletting surplus space.
27 Post employment bene ts The Group operates a variety of post employment bene t arrangements covering both funded and unfunded fide ned bene t schemes and funded fide ned contribution schemes.
The most signi cant are the funded, final salary fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees.
Various fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes are operated in France and Poland, where they are retirement indemnity in nature, and in China.
The overseas schemes are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
fide ned contribution schemes Pension costs for fide ned contribution schemes, at rates speci ed in the individual schemes rules, are as follows: millions 2010 11 2009 10 Charge to operating pro t 6 4 fide ned bene t schemes The Groups principal fide ned bene t pension scheme is in the UK.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes bene ciaries.
The UK scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the scheme Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
The Company monitors the scheme funding level on a regular basis and will review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place.
UK scheme interest in property partnership On 28 January 2011 the Group entered into an arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the current scheme fide cit.
The Group established a partnership, King sher Scottish Limited Partnership King sher SLP.
The partnership interests are held by the Group and by the scheme, the latter resulting from a 78m investment made by the scheme Trustee.
This investment followed a Group contribution of the same amount into the scheme.
Under IAS 19, Employee bene ts, the investment held by the scheme in King sher SLP does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly the pension fide cit position does not re ect the 78m investment.
The Group has control over the partnership and therefore it is consolidated in these Group financial statements.
Accordingly, advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 from the requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of the partnerships accounts.
UK property assets with a market value of 83m were transferred into the partnership and leased back to B&Q plc.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the exibility to substitute alternative properties.
The Trustee has a first charge over the properties in the event that King sher plc becomes insolvent.
The schemes partnership interest entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the next 20 years.
These future payments to the scheme by King sher SLP will be re ected as Group pension contributions on a cash basis.
At the end of this term, King sher plc has the option to acquire the Trustees partnership interest in King sher SLP.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension schemes are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to signi cant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis.
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx and scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets re ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and the mix of assets in the schemes.
indd 86 86 14 4 11 14 4 11 12:23:47 12:23:47 King sher plc Annual Report and Accounts 87 2010 11 For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of the membership of the scheme from 2007 to 2010.
The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables SAPS tables projected forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a minimum of 1% pa.
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows: Years 2010 11 2009 10 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 86.4 87.2 Female 87.1 85.9 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 87.1 88.8 Female 88.7 87.1 The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on obligations resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
