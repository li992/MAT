Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 93 Notes to the Company accounts continued 4 Pension schemes The UK defined benefit scheme is described in note 7 to the Group accounts.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2010 and has been updated to 31 March 2011 by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The accounting deficit in the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
As allowed by FRS 17, the deficit has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc portion of it.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities of the scheme were: 2011 2010 2009 Discount rate 5.50% 5.40% 6.25% Rate of increase in salaries 2.55% 2.55% 2.55% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.20% 3.30% 3.00% Inflation assumption 3.30% 3.40% 3.00% The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.
The expected long-term rates of return on the scheme assets as at 31 March were: 2011 2010 2009 Equities 7.40% 7.50% 7.20% Corporate bonds 5.00% 4.75% 5.75% Diversified growth funds 6.90% 7.00% 6.70% Enhanced matching funds 3.80% 3.70% 3.40% Hedge funds n a 7.50% n a Credit funds 6.50% 6.50% n a Government bonds 3.90% 4.00% 3.70% Cash 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% The valuation of the assets of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Equities 103.6 86.8 79.9 Corporate bonds 18.4 17.4 14.4 Government bonds 6.5 6.1 16.5 Diversified growth funds 139.1 126.7 94.0 Enhanced matching funds 41.0 37.5 34.8 Hedge funds 15.8 Credit funds 12.9 12.2 Cash 1.3 2.1 0.7 Total market value of assets 322.8 304.6 240.3 The valuation of the scheme as at 31 March was: 2011 2010 m m Total market value of assets 322.8 304.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 297.9 314.8 Surplus deficit in the scheme 24.9 10.2 Unrecognised pension surplus 25.1 Deficit in the scheme recognised in the accounts of RS Components Ltd 0.2 10.2 Related deferred tax asset 2.9 Net pension liability 0.2 7.3 In addition, the value of the assets held in respect of AVCs amounted to 0.6m as at 31 March 2011 2010: 0.5m.
