The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
