Financial statements notes to the accounts For the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 29 June 2011.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares arelisted on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted bythe EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 prior year 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable tocompanies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, exceptwhere otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, GreeneKing Finance plc.
Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated as a quasisubsidiary.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent companywith adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exceptions noted below.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Group Cashsettled Sharebased Payment Arrangements The amended standard affects the accounting for cashsettled sharebased payment transactions and supersedes IFRIC 8 and IFRIC 11.
The adoption of the amendment had no impact on the financial performance or position of the group.
IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations effective 1 July 2009 The amended standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with certain significant changes.
All payments to purchase a business will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through the income statement.
Goodwill and noncontrolling interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis.
Noncontrolling interests can be calculated at either fair value or at a share of net assets determined on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
All transaction costs will be expensed.
The revision to the standard has resulted in certain transaction costs which previously would have been capitalised and formed part of goodwill on acquisition being charged to the profit and loss account as exceptional acquisition costs, see note 5.
IAS 27 Amended Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 July 2009 The standard requires the effects of all transactions with noncontrolling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.
It will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses through the income statement.
The revised standard also specifies the accounting whencontrol is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
The amendment to the standard has been applied prospectively and had no impact on the financial position or performance of the group.
Significant accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term ofthe lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, ifappropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on derecognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, andis included in the income statement in the year of derecognition.
co. uk Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 41 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of theconsideration transferred, measured at acquisition date, fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
Thechoice of measurement of noncontrolling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable netassets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation inaccordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the noncontrolling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of preexisting relationships or postacquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractuallegal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisitiondate fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the noncontrolling interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any preexisting interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the groups cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and can not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes anestimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group.
An asset or cash generating units recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and valueinuse and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
42 Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 www.
co. uk Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, heldtomaturity investments or availableforsale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, reevaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are nonderivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are derecognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it available for sale in its current condition, management are committed to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interestbearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
co. uk Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 43 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables are noninterest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other postemployment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group incomestatement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations, less past service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Postemployment healthcare benefit The group also provided certain additional postemployment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined on the same basis as the defined benefit pension schemes.
Sharebased payments Certain employees and directors receive equitysettled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a BlackScholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered nonvesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, nonvesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or nonvesting conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured using IFRS 2.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is recognised on a straightline basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
44 Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 www.
co. uk Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current the portion relating to the next financial period or noncurrent prepayments.
These are amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied As at 1 May 2011 there are a number of standards and interpretations that were issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendment Deferred Taxes: Recovery of underlying assets This amendment, effective on or after 1 January 2012 introduces the requirement that deferred tax on nondepreciable assets measured using the revaluation model in IAS16 should be measured on a sale basis.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Amendment The amended standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, clarifies the definition of a related party tosimplify the identification of related party relationships, particularly in relation to significant influence and joint control.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure Amendment This amendment, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, requires additional quantitative disclosures relating to transfers of financial assets.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement The standard is the first phase in the IASBs work to replace IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial assets asdefined in IAS 39.
This will represent a change in reporting where an entity has designated liabilities using the fair value option.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amounts of a net pension asset.
It permits the treatment of the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement as an asset.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid.
Theequity instruments issued are measured at the fair value, unless this cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are measured atthe fair value of the liability extinguished.
Any gain or loss being recognised immediately in the income statement.
These standards and interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial position or performance.
co. uk Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 45 Financial statements notes to the accounts continued For the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the valueinuse of the cash generating unit that the assets are grouped within.
Valueinuse calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the valueinuse of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Business combinations The group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value.
The assessment of fair value, particularly for property, plant and equipment acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market trends.
Note 17 describes the business combinations in the current year and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained.
Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting nonmarket based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Property provisions The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expenses is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts.
However changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level ofprovision recorded.
2 Segment information On 3 December 2010 the group announced that the Belhaven business segment would be fully integrated into Greene King.
Changes to the management structure took place in January 2011.
The integration took place progressively from this date and, accordingly, we have disclosed below the segmental analysis based on the current structure.
As a result of this change the group now has the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers: Retail: Managed houses and restaurants Pub Partners: Tenanted houses Brewing and Brands: Brewing beer, marketing and selling These are also considered to be the groups operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms length basis.

Acquisition costs are items of oneoff expenditure incurred in connection with acquisition of businesses in the year.
These costs include legal and professional fees incurred by the group and stamp duty which in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised can no longer be included within the consideration for the acquisition.
In addition as, as detailed in note 17, acquisition costs include a charge of 0.3m relating to amounts payable to the former owners of Cloverleaf Restaurants.
The pension credit has resulted following curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme retiring early.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 3.6m 2010: 1.0m comprises a total profit on disposal of 8.3m 2010: 5.0m and a total loss on disposal of 4.7m 2010: 4.0m.
During the prior year the group received a refund of 7m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which was recognised as exceptional income.
The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and the case will be heard on 30 June 2011.
Should HMRC be successful in their appeal the group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as such this represents a contingent liability.
An exceptional gain of 6.8m net of associated costs was recognised.
Exceptional finance costs During the year ended 2 May 2010 the group repurchased securitised debt with a nominal value of 30.3m recognising a net gain of 13.5m.
Following the receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue and the subsequent repurchase of securitised debt certain interest swaps were no longer deemed to be effective hedges.
All ineffective swaps were cancelled during the period to 2 May 2010 resulting in an exceptional charge of 3.3m.
Exceptional tax The tax credit on indexation of properties represents the tax impact of movements in RPI during the period on the tax base cost of properties.
The Provisional Collector of Taxes Act 1968 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 9.1m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of 12.9m and a debit to group statement of comprehensive income of 3.8m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods is in respect of deferred taxation on revaluation and rolled over gains on land and buildings.

In the prior periods executive share option plans ESOS have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors remuneration report on pages 84 to 86.
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions is 3.5m 2010: 1.7m.
A corresponding credit of 3.0m 2010: 1.7m has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of equitysettled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a BlackScholes model.
The fair value ofthe grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2011 LTIP SAYE Weighted average share price 413p 474p Exercise price 368p Expected dividend yield 4.5% 4.5% Riskfree rate of return 1.3% 1.9% Volatility 49.0% 47.1% Expected life years 3.0 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 354p 158p www.

Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the midpoint of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
Movement in outstanding options and rights during the period is as follows: ESOS Weighted average Number of options exercise price 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m p p Outstanding at the beginning of the period 4.5 4.8 680 703 Granted Forfeited 1.4 1.4 827 786 Exercised 0.5 0.1 322 506 Adjustment due to rights issue 1.2 705 Outstanding at the end of the period 2.6 4.5 451 680 Exercisable at the end of the period 1.1 1.8 453 518 Balance at the beginning of the period includes 0.3m 2010: 0.3m shares under options granted pre7 November 2002 and nil 2010: 0.3m at the end of period.
Theoptions have not been modified and therefore are not accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
A djustment to the number of shares granted as a result of the bonus element of the rights issue note 26.
This modification of the award did not give rise to an incremental fair value.

The weighted average share price through the period was 441p in 2011 and 431p in 2010.
The rights outstanding at 1 May 2011 under the LTIP had an exercise price of nil 2010: nil and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years 2010: 1.9 years.
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 296p and 746p 2010: 370p 1087p and for the SAYE scheme between 274p and 694p 2010: 274p and 694p.
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 5.7 years for the ESOS 2010: 6.3 years and 2.7 years for the SAYE scheme 2010: 3.1 years.
9 Pensions The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and three defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to postemployment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
The total cost recognised in operating profit for the period was 1.6m 2010: 1.6m.
Defined benefit pension schemes and postemployment benefits The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2009, Belhaven Pension Scheme closed 31 October 2005, last valued 4 May 2008, and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme closed 1 July 2003, last valued 30 April 2009.
During 2010 the Morland Pension Scheme closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2006 merged with the Greene King Pension Scheme.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benefits are related to members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was: Pension schemes Postemployment benefits 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Current service cost 4.6 3.9 Curtailments 5.5 Total recognised in operating profit 0.9 3.9 Expected return on pension scheme assets 15.7 11.6 Interest on scheme liabilities 15.6 14.6 0.3 0.3 Total finance income cost recognised 0.1 3.0 0.3 0.3 During the year there was a curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme who retire early resulting in an exceptional credit to the income statement of 5.5m see note 5.
The total charge recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was: Pension schemes Postemployment benefits 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Actual return on scheme assets 26.1 49.5 Less: expected return on scheme assets 15.7 11.6 Experience gains and losses on scheme assets 10.4 37.9 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 0.7 4.1 Gains losses arising on scheme liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions 8.1 29.3 Actuarial gain recognised through equity 19.2 12.7 In July 2010 the government changed the statutory rate of inflation to which pension increases are linked from RPI to CPI.
The effect of this change on the groups pension schemes was to reduce the total liability by 3.7m.
This adjustment has been reflected as part of the actuarial gain on scheme liabilities arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.
The total contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in the following period are expected to be 13.3m 2010: 7.6m for the group.

Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% during the period it is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposals would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by a further 13.2m.

13 Goodwill m Cost At 3 May 2009 673.8 Acquired through business combinations note 17 5.9 At 2 May 2010 679.7 Acquired through business combinations note 17 26.1 At 1 May 2011 705.8 All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 330.5m 2010: 259.5m to Retail, 160.8m 2010: 152.3m to Pub Partners, 214.5m 2010: 138.7m to Brewing Company, and nil 2010: 129.2m to Belhaven.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a valueinuse calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all operating segments are: the pretax discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% 2010: 9.0%, which is based on the groups weighted average cost of capital and is used as an approximation for the riskadjusted cost of capital of the relevant operating segment: and the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2.0% 2010: 2.0% which is below the longterm average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to market growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
Thecalculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for pretax discount rate and growth rate.
Neither a 1% decrease inassumed growth rate nor a 1% increase in the discount rate applied or a 10% reduction in budgeted cashflows would have led to an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations have been retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,429.6m 2010: 1,448.1m over which there is a first charge infavour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

These are analysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below: 2011 2010 m m Retail 8.7 13.8 Pub Partners 15.3 19.1 Belhaven 5.4 1.9 Corporate 2.5 29.4 37.3 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9% 2010: 9% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% 2010: 2% which is below the longterm average growth rate for the industry.
Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of mediumterm trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail, Pub Partners and Belhaven estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance ofa relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK consumer environment seen in the year.
The impairment losses recognised within the Corporate estate are primarily as a result of the reduction in the fair value less costs to sell of unlicensed properties acquired as part of business combinations in previous years.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pretax discount rates would be as follows: Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount: 2011 2010 m m Retail 1.6 3.1 Pub Partners 2.9 3.2 Belhaven 0.1 0.4 Corporate 4.6 6.7 Increased impairment resulting from a 1% reduction in growth rate: 2011 2010 m m Retail 1.6 2.8 Pub Partners 2.9 2.6 Belhaven 0.1 0.3 Corporate 4.6 5.7 15 Financial assets 2011 2010 m m Trade loans net of provision 4.6 Total current 4.6 Trade loans net of provision 34.2 40.3 Investments 1.6 1.5 Total noncurrent 35.8 41.8 Trade loans are net of provisions of 4.6m 2010: 4.6m, which represents the totality of impaired debt.
During the year 0.3m 2010: 0.4m of the provision was utilised and 0.3m 2010: 0.3m of new provision created.
All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, areconsidered to be neither past due nor impaired.
Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income.
The fixed rate trade loans amounted to 26.8m 2010: 29.2m and variable rate trade loans amounted to 16.6m 2010: 15.7m.
Included in fixed rate loans are 6.6m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels 2010: 13.0m.
The writedown of these loans has been taken on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the settlement.
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 2.65% 2010: 2.44% and a weighted average period of 6.77 years 2010:6.45years.
Interest rates on variable rate trade loans are linked to base rate.

Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies, the difference between property portfolio value and fair valueinuse and the proven ability of the management of Cloverleaf and Realpubs to develop businesses in their respective markets.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed by the company.
Properties have been revalued at their existing use value.
From the date of acquisition the four sites acquired from Punch Taverns have contributed operating profit of 0.4m.

From the date of acquisition Realpubs has contributed 0.1m operating profit to the groups result with a net operating cash outflow of 0.2m.
Prior to acquisition the results of the acquired businesses were prepared under UK GAAP using different accounting polices and bases and therefore a proforma trading result has not been produced.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreements for the Cloverleaf and Realpubs acquisitions a total of 5.0m will be payable in cash to certain former owners who have remained as employees of the Greene King group two years from the date of completion based on the estimated future profitability of the business.
The cost of these payments will be recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over this period.
The charge recognised in the current year is 0.3m.
During the prior period the group acquired three packages of pubs: 11 pubs were acquired from Punch Taverns on 1 July 2009 for 31.6m, seven from Mitchells & Butlers on 8 December 2009 for 13.4m and a further eight from Punch Taverns for 16.6m on 16 February 2010.

Bank loans unsecured During the period the group agreed a fiveyear revolving credit facility, signed on 1 April 2011, of 400m, of which 110m was drawn down at the year end.
Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions.
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity.
Although any individual drawdowns are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding.
Immediate renewal is available under the 400m facility until April 2016.
Finalrepayment of the total drawndown balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Securitised debt The group has issued various tranches of bonds totalling 1,500.0m, in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the groups pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.

Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond.
All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds.
The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions onits ability to move cash to other group companies.
Loan notes unsecured The group issued loan notes during 2006 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
These have a maturity date of September 2011 and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semiannually.
The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 0.55% 2010: 0.30%.
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classified as current debt.
24 Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and shortterm deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 1 May 2011 and 2 May 2010.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year as a whole.
The following assumptions were made: Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move.
Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the yearend.
An explanation for the split between those hedges that were effective at the yearend and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 0.3m 2010: 0.2m and the groups equity by 87.7m 2010: 91.6m.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and longterm debt.
Thegroups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2010: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interestbearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month.
Shortterm flexibility is achieved through the use of shortterm borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 1 May 2011 and 2 May 2010 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.

Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a nonsignificant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, themaximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 1 May 2011 the group held an interest rate swap contract 2010: nil, with a nominal value of 40m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the 110m draw down from the variable credit facility in the year.
The interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 0.3m.
The cash flows occurred semiannually based a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 1 May 2011 the group held 5 2010: 5 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 759.6m 2010: 728.6m, entered into as part ofthe securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps.
A fair value net liability of 116.3m 2010: 108.8m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 759.6m 2010: 728.6m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 4.834% 2010: 5.101%.
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036.
The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the yearend was 98.0% 2010: 98.7% in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.
Interest rate risk The following tables set out the groups exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest bearing financial asset and financial liability.

Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in the above as they are noninterest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount stated in the accounts.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
