79 Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2011 Notes to the accounts Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and reportable segment.
A summary of the 2011 goodwill allocation by reportable segment is shown below: North Asia 2011 2010 UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total Total m m m m m m m Textiles & Hygiene 3.9 56.5 60.4 58.6 Pest Control 4.8 35.1 64.7 0.2 104.8 102.0 Asia Pacific 85.5 85.5 85.6 Ambius 2.8 13.4 16.2 16.3 City Link 108.1 Initial Facilities 22.1 22.1 18.3 31 December 2011 30.8 94.4 78.1 85.5 0.2 289.0 31 December 2010 135.0 92.3 75.7 85.6 0.3 388.9 Key assumptions The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management and the board covering a three-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process.
Cash flows for years 4 and 5 use managements expectation of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 2% and 3% 2010: 2% and 3% and pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 13% 2010: 9% and 12%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
Impairment charges 2011 2010 m m Textiles & Hygiene Europe 1.1 Asia Pacific 2.3 2.8 City Link UK 108.1 95.0 111.5 97.8 All impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement within operating expenses.
At the end of 2009 City Link had capitalised goodwill of 203.1 million held in respect of the acquisition of Target Express and the ex-City Link franchise companies.
The annual impairment review in 2010 resulted in an impairment charge of 95.0 million triggered by reduced actual and forecast future cash flows.
The City Link impairment charge of 108.1 million in 2011 was triggered by reduced actual and forecast future cash flows with City Link struggling in 2011 to take out operating costs in line with revenue and volume decline.
There is no remaining City Link goodwill.
The actual and forecast cash flows indicate a recoverable amount for City Link below that of the residual net assets, after goodwill impairment.
As a consequence, these assets have been impaired to that recoverable amount.
In allocating that impairment, individual assets have been reduced no further than the higher of their fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use.
The impact is an additional write down to reduce the customer list intangibles to zero as set out in the table on page 79.
The key assumption in arriving at the impairment is a return to profit within a three-year period.
Additionally, a pre-tax discount rate of 13% and a long-term growth rate of 2% were used.
The impairment charges in the Textiles & Hygiene and Asia Pacific segments arose due to deteriorating trading conditions within two specific businesses in these segments.
Sensitivity analysis The value of residual City Link net assets following the impairment is 20.6 million at 31 December 2011.
A reduction in the long-term growth rate of 1% would result in an additional impairment of 4.2 million to the remaining net assets.
The remaining goodwill balance of 289.0 million is spread across a number of CGUs, sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
