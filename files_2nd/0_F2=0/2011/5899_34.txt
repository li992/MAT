Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as follows: 2011 2010 m m Engineered Conveyor Solutions Fenner Dunlop Americas, Europe and Australia 14.3 14.3 Conveyor Belting India 2.0 2.0 Fenner Dunlop Conveyor Services Americas 13.4 14.1 Spliceline 1.0 0.9 Northern Belting Specialists 2.7 2.3 BBCS LECS - 12.5 Statewide Belting Service - 5.5 Advanced Engineered Products Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Process 15.7 16.6 Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Fluid Power 28.7 27.6 Dawson Hose UK 2.2 2.2 Fenner Drives US 3.3 3.5 Prodesco 6.9 7.2 Fenner Precision Buffalo 2.9 3.0 Xeridiem 3.3 1.6 Multiseals - 1.0 115.4 95.3 The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used to determine the value in use relate to profits derived from sales volumes, selling prices and costs, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
Cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts for a period of three years which have been approved by Group management.
The principal components of these forecasts: sales volumes, selling prices and costs, are based on recent history and expected future changes in operating conditions.
Cash flows beyond a period of three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
These rates range from 1.7% to 3.2% for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 8.1% has been applied and Multiseals in Singapore where a rate of 4.4% has been applied.
Cash flows are discounted using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital after adjusting for a country risk premium.
The discount rate used for all cash-generating units was 11.2% except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 14.8% was used.
The discount rates reflect the risk profiles in the respective territories.
There is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value for all of the cash-generating units in the above table.
The above assumptions apply to all of the Groups cash-generating units.
