Pensions Defined benefit plans The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Groups most significant plan.
There is in addition a United Kingdom unfunded plan.
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows: 2011 2010 $ million $ million Assets UK defined benefit pension plan Staff Plan 7.1 UK defined benefit pension plan Cash Plan 0.7 0.6 0.7 7.7 Liabilities UK defined benefit pension plan Staff Plan 12.5 UK unfunded plan 0.6 0.6 13.1 0.6 The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the Plans as at 1 April 2009.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Inflation RPI 3.0 3.4 Inflation CPI 2.0 2.5 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.7 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.9 3.2 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.0 2.2 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.0 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.6 5.5 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 5.5 5.8 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.

Pensions continued The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 2010 aged 68 will live on average for a further 21.9 years 2010 19.2 years if they are male and for a further 23.8 years 2010 21.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2021 2010 in 2020 at age 65 2010 age 64 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.9 years 2010 23.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.7 years 2010 25.6 years after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum.
This would increase past service liabilities by $3.9 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor.
This would increase past service liabilities by $8.2 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of $67.5 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2003.

Pensions continued The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2011 of $0.6 million 2010 $0.6 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There were no experience gains or losses in the period from 2007 to 2011 on the unfunded plan.
Expected contributions for these plans for 2012 are $2.8 million, including $2.5 million of additional contributions to fund the deficit arising from the actuarial valuation at 1 April 2009.
Defined contribution plans United Kingdom The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom.
Employer contributions into these plans for 2011 were $1.4 million 2010 $1.1 million.
United States The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries.
This plan, also known as a 401 k Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Groups contributions to the US plan totalled $3.2 million for 2011 2010 $3.0 million.
Total assets in the defined contribution plan at the end of 2011 were $145.7 million 2010 $144.9 million.
There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2011 or 2010.
Other jurisdictions Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations.
These arrangements are defined contribution plans.
Total employer contributions for 2011 in respect of these plans amounted to $0.6 million 2010 $0.5 million.
Total employer contributions to defined contribution plans were $5.2 million 2010 $4.6 million.
