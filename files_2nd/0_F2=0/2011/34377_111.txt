The fair values of debentures and unsecured bonds have been established by obtaining quoted market prices from brokers.
The bank debt and loan notes have been valued assuming they could be renegotiated at contracted margins.
The derivatives have been valued by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, by an independent treasury adviser.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities, floating rate bonds and floating rate investments, caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2011 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 38m 2010: liability of 39m.
The cross currency swap, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure on the US Private Placement, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The market value of this is an asset of 1m 2010: asset of 5m.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2011 was nil 2010: 1m.
The cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt and floating rate investments.
The table below summarises foreign currency denominated debt, variable rate debt and investments hedged at 31 March 2011.
Cash flow hedged debt and floating rate investments 2011 2010 m m Outstanding: at one year 680 781 at two years 680 881 at five years 44 431 at ten years 250 250 The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2011 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset of 4m 2010: 1m.

At 31 March 2011 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 5.65% 2010: 5.58%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 16.3 years 2010: 19.7 years.
The weighted average interest rate for the Euro fixed rate debt is 4.46% 2010: 4.52% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 5.2 years 2010: 6.1 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 72% at 31 March 2011.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 27m 2010: 18m decrease.
Similarly, a 576 bps reduction would increase profits by 4m 2010: 2m increase.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over the last ten years.

The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
The majority of the Groups interest rate swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in their fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven year Sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
At 31 March 2011 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps by 24m 2010: 73m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of the interest rate swap portfolio by 51m 2010: 118m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, and floating rate investments, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
Foreign currency risk management Group policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as will the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
This explains the excess of Euro denominated liabilities over assets.
Based on the 31 March 2011 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a 3m reduction 2010: 6m reduction in reported profits.

Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2011 amounted to 60m 2010: 74m.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with A or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2011 the fair value of all interest rate derivatives which had a positive value was 11m 2010: 11m.
At 31 March 2011 the fair value of liquid investments was 203m 2010: 195m.
At 31 March 2011, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and interest rate swaps was 123m 2010: 150m.
This represents 1.7% 2010: 2.3% of gross assets.
The deposits and liquid investments exposures are with UK high street banks.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 14.
Included within trade and other debtors is deferred consideration of 31m, of which 10m may fall due after one year.
Management has made due consideration of the credit risk associated with this, resulting in no impairment for credit risk being made.

The table below presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of 12 years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
