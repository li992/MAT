16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are in investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
For details of the Companys bank borrowing facility, see note 14.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings should be used to fund short term cash requirements.

16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.

In summary, the exposure to credit and counterparty risk at 30 June 2011 was to cash at bank of 480,000 2010: 1,475,000 and to other receivables of 6,244,000 2010: 4,540,000.
