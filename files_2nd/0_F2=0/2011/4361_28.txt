66 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reflects the segments underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to the product types, has been used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments.
Trading profit is defined as profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, but includes the Group share of post-tax profit of associates and joint ventures.
The Groups operating segments are Cheese, UK Spreads, St Hubert, Liquid Products, Customer Direct previously Household, Share of Associates and Joint Ventures and Other.
Certain of these operating segments have been aggregated and the Group reports on five continuing segments within the business: Cheese, Spreads, Dairies, Share of Associates and Joint Ventures and Other.
For Group reporting purposes, the UK Spreads and St Hubert segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment being Spreads.
Both of these segments operate within Western Europe where long-term GDP growth rates and spreads market growth rates are similar.
Both manufacture predominantly branded dairy spreads, using similar production methods with a significant investment in advertising and promotion.
The two businesses have margins consistent with predominantly branded products.
The key input risks faced by both businesses are similar vegetable oil, packaging costs.
The majority of sales are to major multiple retailers and distribution methods are similar.
Having considered these factors, management have judged that the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria for these businesses have been met and that aggregation is appropriate.
Furthermore, the Liquid Products and Customer Direct segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment being Dairies.
The Liquid Products and Customer Direct businesses operate in the UK and both generate the majority of their revenue from selling fresh milk, a commodity product characterised by lower margins than branded products.
Many aspects of these businesses are managed on a combined basis, namely milk sourcing, production volumes, demand planning, technical, quality and distribution.
Our dairies process and pack milk for both businesses.
Both businesses exhibit similar gross margins.
The two segments supply milk to a wide range of customers from major multiple retailers through foodservice, bottled milk buyers and doorstep customers.
Certain customers are supplied by both businesses and doorstep customers and resultant bad debt risks only represent a small proportion of combined revenue.
The Cheese segment has not been aggregated with any other segment.
This business manufactures predominantly branded cheese in the UK and sells mainly to retail customers.
Share of Associates and Joint Ventures forms a separate segment whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis consistent with IFRS.
The results of this segment are now insignificant following the Groups disposal of its 49% share of Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited in March 2009.
The Other segment comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the operating segments.
Generally, all central costs less external Other revenue are recharged back into operating segments such that their result reflects the total cost base of the Group.
Other segment profit therefore is nil.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 67 1 Segmental analysis continued The segment results for the year ended 31 March 2011 and for the year ended 31 March 2010 and the reconciliation of segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the financial statements are as follows: Year ended 31 March 2011 2010 Note m m Segment external revenue Cheese 223.1 260.0 Spreads 285.5 277.7 Dairies 1,089.8 1,081.2 Other 6.1 10.8 Total segment external revenue 1,604.5 1,629.7 Segment profit Cheese 28.0 16.9 Spreads 53.3 54.0 Dairies 27.1 34.9 Share of associates and joint ventures' net profit 15 0.2 0.1 Total segment profit 108.2 105.9 Finance costs 5 20.6 22.4 Adjusted profit before tax 87.6 83.5 Acquired intangible amortisation 13 8.7 9.2 Exceptional items 4 1.1 4.0 Other finance expense pensions 5 0.5 Group profit before tax 77.8 77.8 Segment total assets Cheese 199.6 211.8 Spreads 507.3 511.8 Dairies 370.2 347.2 Share of associates and joint ventures 2.4 Other 34.1 31.6 Group 1,113.6 1,102.4 Unsegmented assets 68.9 45.5 Total assets 1,182.5 1,147.9 Inter-segment revenue Cheese 7.4 6.3 Spreads 8.4 4.1 Dairies Elimination 15.8 10.4 Total The numbers 68 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segmental analysis continued Year ended 31 March 2011 2010 Note m m Segment depreciation and amortisation excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets Cheese 5.5 5.8 Spreads 6.2 7.2 Dairies 19.8 20.9 Other 3.0 4.9 Total 3 34.5 38.8 Segment additions to non-current assets Cheese 7.4 4.8 Spreads 8.3 5.6 Dairies 32.3 19.3 Other 4.1 1.9 Total 52.1 31.6 Segment exceptional items Cheese 1.9 17.5 Dairies 3.0 1.0 Pension curtailment gain not segmented 16.3 OFT settlement reduction not segmented 2.2 Share of associates and joint ventures 2.0 Total 4 1.1 4.0 Interest income and expense are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Group treasury is centrally managed and external interest income and expense is mostly incurred in the UK and is not allocated to segments.
Where interest is reviewed by the CODM it is done so on a net basis.
Further analysis of the interest expense for the Group is provided in Note 5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Group tax is centrally managed and the Group effective tax rate, not individual segment tax rates, is reported.
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method and deferred consideration but exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets as these items are managed on a Group basis.
Other segment assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the segments.
Total segment liabilities have not been presented as this measure is not regularly reviewed by or provided to the CODM.
Inter-segment revenue comprises the sale of finished Cheese and Spreads products to the Dairies segment on a cost plus basis and is included in the segment result.
Other inter-segment transactions principally comprise sales of cream from the Dairies segment to the Spreads segment for the manufacture of butters.
Cream sold into Spreads is priced by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reflect the costs that the Spreads segment would incur if it were a stand-alone entity.
Revenue from inter-segment cream sales is not reported as revenue to the CODM but as a reduction to the Dairies segments input costs.
Segment depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 8.7 million 2010: 9.2 million as these costs are not charged in the segment result.
Segment additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

No individual customer contributes more than 10% of Group revenue 2010: none.
The business segmentation above is based upon similar product groupings, namely cheese, spreads and liquids, and therefore any analysis of Group revenue by products and services is consistent with the revenue analysis presented above with the exception of non-milk product sales in the Dairies segment through the Customer Direct division, which amounted to 112.3 million 2010: 113.3 million.

Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP and its associates for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts of the Company because Group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
Ernst & Young LLP are auditors of the Dairy Crest Pension Scheme.
Fees paid by the pension scheme for audit services are not included in the above table.

This restructure will result in more centralised back office activities supporting the depot network and generate significant savings.
Most of the cost relates to redundancies 2.5 million, but certain incremental running costs are being incurred 0.5 million.
Exceptional expenditure on this project is expected to total approximately 4 million in the year ending 31 March 2012.
On 12 June 2010 the Group sold 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited WCL for cash proceeds of 9 million, resulting in a 30% shareholding post-disposal and a loss of controlling interest to Wexford Milk Producers WMP.
At 31 March 2010, the assets and liabilities of WCL were disclosed as a disposal group held for sale and the carrying value of assets was impaired to reflect the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
The final gain on disposal of 1.9 million includes the reclassification to profit and loss of certain items previously taken to other comprehensive income and is further analysed in Note 30.
Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2010 comprised: Our new cheese cutting and packing operation in Nuneaton became fully operational in the first half of that year.
In 2008 09 and during the first half of 2009 10, volumes were being ramped up with additional packing being carried out by a third party.
We incurred duplicate running costs during this time until the Nuneaton site was running at full capacity.
In 2009 10 these costs amounted to 1.5 million.
Having closed our Nottingham dairy in 2008 09, the site was sold during the year for cash proceeds of 2.5 million resulting in an exceptional profit of 1.0 million.
On 30 April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading OFT announced that the parties to the 2007 Statement of Objections would get a penalty reduction provided each company continued to cooperate with the OFT.
Accordingly, the provision was reduced to reflect our best estimate of the penalty ultimately payable along with any further professional fees.
This resulted in an exceptional release of 2.2 million.
During the year, having consulted with employees, we closed the Dairy Crest defined benefit pension scheme to future service accrual with an effective date of April 2010.
The closure of the scheme to future service accrual resulted in an exceptional curtailment gain of 16.9 million and significantly reduces future pension risks.
Fees of 0.6 million were incurred resulting in a net exceptional credit of 16.3 million.
On disposal of our 49% share of Yoplait Dairy Crest YDC in March 2009, the Group placed cash in an escrow account to cover the cost of closing the YDC defined benefit pension scheme.
The final cost of closure was lower than anticipated and the Group received 2.0 million back from escrow net of fees during the year.
The cash inflow of 1.2 million reflects professional fees and costs accrued at 31 March 2009 but not settled until 2009 10.
We announced on 2 February 2010 our intention to sell a majority share of our investment in WCL, a cheese manufacturing business in Ireland.
The sale had not been completed at 31 March 2010, however the assets and liabilities of WCL represented a disposal group held for sale at that date.
The carrying value of WCL assets was impaired by 16.0 million to managements best estimate of the businesss fair value less costs to sell.

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
Following the Budget of 23 March 2011, a further reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011.
This reduced the effective rate applicable from April 2011 to 26%.
Since both of these reductions were substantially enacted at the 31 March 2011 balance sheet date, we have adjusted deferred tax balances to reflect the 26% rate.
Note that substantial deferred tax liabilities in respect of St Hubert brands are calculated at the prevailing corporation tax rate in France and are therefore unaffected by these changes.
Further reductions to the main rate of UK corporation tax are proposed that will reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by April 2014.
These are expected to be separately enacted each year.
We estimate that a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% would reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 3.1 million.

Where deferred tax assets and liabilities are in the same tax jurisdiction, they are netted off.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities in separate jurisdictions are not netted.
The Company has a deferred tax liability of 0.2 million at 31 March 2011 2010: 0.2 million.
This relates to temporary differences in respect of financial instruments.

Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised.
The Group has realised capital gains amounting to 37.0 million 2010: 43.0 million for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made.
The numbers 74 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 7 Dividends paid and proposed 2011 2010 Declared and paid during the year m m Equity dividends on ordinary shares: Final dividend for 2010: 13.6 pence 2009: 13.0 pence 18.1 17.3 Interim dividend for 2011: 5.5 pence 2010: 5.3 pence 7.3 7.0 25.4 24.3 Proposed for approval at AGM not recognised as a liability at 31 March Equity dividends on ordinary shares: Final dividend for 2011: 14.2 pence 2010: 13.6 pence 18.9 18.1 8 Disposal group held for sale at 31 March 2010 On 2 February 2010, the Group announced that it was in advanced discussions with Wexford Milk Producers to sell 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited which if successful, would result in Wexford Milk Producers becoming the majority shareholder in Wexford Creamery Limited.
This transaction completed in June 2010 see Note 30 but at 31 March 2010, the Wexford Creamery Limited assets and liabilities were disclosed as held in a disposal group held for sale.
The assets and liabilities of Wexford Creamery Limited comprised a disposal group held for sale and were separately identified as such at 31 March 2010.
The disposal group was analysed as follows: Assets in disposal group held for sale m Deferred tax asset 0.3 Investment in joint ventures 0.6 Inventories 4.6 Trade and other receivables 5.8 Cash and short-term deposits 7.5 18.8 Liabilities associated with disposal group held for sale m Trade and other payables 4.7 Retirement benefit obligations 2.0 Deferred income 0.6 Current tax liability 0.3 7.6 On recognition of the disposal group held for sale, an impairment of 16.0 million was recognised against the previous carrying value of Wexford Creamery Limiteds net assets.
This write-down was necessary to reduce the carrying value of the disposal group to the estimated fair value less costs to sell of the business calculated by reference to the proposed consideration of 9 million for 50% of the business adjusted for other costs, and fair value implications of the proposed divestment including options relating to the remaining 30% holding and proposed commercial agreements post completion.
In the first instance, 2.6 million was allocated to property, plant and equipment to write down the carrying value to nil.
The remaining 13.4 million impairment was allocated against inventories as there were no other scoped-in non-current assets against which to allocate the remaining impairment and inventories comprised the largest value current asset available for allocation.
Inventories comprised principally maturing cheese stocks.
The retirement benefit obligation related to the Wexford defined benefit pension scheme.
The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2010 was 10.2 million and the defined benefit obligation was 12.2 million resulting in a net scheme deficit of 2.0 million.
Wexford Creamery Limited was reported within the Cheese segment.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 75 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS on profit for the year is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Basic EPS is calculated on the basis of Group profit for the year less profit attributable to non-controlling interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share has been calculated.
The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share including adjusted earnings per share is as follows: Year ended 31 March 2011 Year ended 31 March 2010 Weighted Weighted average Per share average Per share Earnings no of shares amount Earnings no of shares amount m million pence m million pence Basic EPS on profit for the year Net profit attributable to equity shareholders 57.5 133.2 43.2 54.0 133.0 40.6 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 2.5 0.9 1.4 0.4 Diluted EPS on profit for the year 57.5 135.7 42.3 54.0 134.4 40.2 Adjusted basic EPS Basic EPS from continuing operations 57.5 133.2 43.2 54.0 133.0 40.6 Exceptional items excluding non-controlling interests net of tax 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.5 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets net of tax 5.8 4.4 6.2 4.6 Pension interest expense net of tax 0.4 0.3 Joint ventures exceptional items net of tax 2.0 1.5 Adjusted basic EPS 62.7 133.2 47.1 59.2 133.0 44.5 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 2.5 0.9 1.4 0.5 Adjusted diluted EPS 62.7 135.7 46.2 59.2 134.4 44.0 There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.

The above costs include amounts paid to the Companys executive and non-executive directors.

The defined benefit scheme closed to future accrual from 1 April 2010, although benefits continued to accrue up until November 2010 consistent with the notice period of 12 months from the date that the cessation of service accrual was made.

All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.3% for UK Spreads and Cheese 2010: 8.5%, 9.1% for St Hubert 2010: 8.9%, 8.3% for Liquid Products 2010: 8.5% and 8.7% for Customer Direct 2010: 9.2%.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specific risk factors.
Discount rates have remained broadly in line with March 2010 as market conditions have not materially changed.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert, Liquid Products and Cheese is 2.0% pa being the estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for the Customer Direct CGU is 0%.
Management considers this a prudent assumption in the light of current milk&more opportunities in the Customer Direct business which is forecast to offset the historical doorstep decline rates beyond 2013 14.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2011 is: Liquid Products 30.9 million 2010: 30.9 million Customer Direct 39.8 million 2010: 39.7 million UK Spreads 65.5 million 2010: 65.5 million St Hubert 197.2 million 2010: 198.6 million Cheese 2.1 million 2010: 2.1 million The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reflect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame.
For the Customer Direct business, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward offset by growth assumptions for milk&more.
The directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 79 12 Goodwill continued 2011 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Customer Direct CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumption is future growth rates.
Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the Customer Direct CGU continue and be greater than 10% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount 2010: 12% per annum.
The impairment headroom for the Customer Direct CGU is approximately 80 million 2010: 94 million.
For the Liquid Products CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumptions are future margins and discount rate.
Management has assumed growth in margins over the next three years following a decline in the year ended 31 March 2011.
Should margins reduce by 20% each year versus assumptions used for impairment testing, then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to below its carrying amount.
Management has assumed a discount rate of 8.3% in calculating value in use.
Should the discount rate increase to 10% then the carrying value would exceed the CGUs recoverable amount.
The impairment headroom for the Liquid Products CGU is approximately 40 million.

The WCL options comprise call and put options over 20% of the company for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of WCLs post-tax profits from June 2010 until the date of exercise.
This comprises a Level 3 valuation, namely that it is not based on inputs observable directly or indirectly.
Management has valued this option by comparing the current equity accounted carrying value of the 20% holding with the estimated present value of consideration received from the exercise of the option.
The difference between these amounts comprises the option value of 1.6 million at 31 March 2011.
The principal input assumptions in valuing these options are: i estimated future profits of WCL which have been based upon best available budgets and forecasts: ii an appropriate post-tax discount rate of 6%: and iii an option exercise date of 2018.
Over the period until exercise of these options, any movement in the fair value of these instruments is charged credited to the income statement.

Both facilities have interest payments based on LIBOR EURIBOR plus a margin.
This margin flexes every six months based on the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio at 31 March and 30 September.
At 31 March 2011, the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times 2010: 2.4 times resulting in margins of 52.5 basis points on the 2011 facility 2010: 52.5 basis points and 120.0 basis points on the 2013 facility 2010: 120.0 basis points.
On a day-to-day basis the Group utilises the 2011 facility fully before utilising the 2013 facility as it has a lower margin.
Borrowings at 31 March 2011 and 2010 are under the 2011 facility, however there is an expectation that on maturity of the 2011 facility, the 2013 facility will be utilised for all of the Groups funding requirements.
Any borrowings drawn under the November 2011 facility can be replaced with borrowings under the 2013 facility on expiration of the former.
For this reason, although amounts drawn down under the 2011 facility have been classified as current at 31 March 2011, they will be replaced by borrowings under non-current facilities during 2011 12.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, and minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2011 2010: none.

21 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK which was closed to future service accrual from 1 April 2010.
This pension scheme is a final salary scheme that had previously been closed to new employees joining after 30 June 2006.
Employees joining after this date and those members of the defined benefit pension scheme on its closure to future service accrual were invited to join the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution plan.
During the year ended 31 March 2010, Wexford Creamery Limited became a disposal group held for sale.
As a result the Wexford pension scheme is not included in the analysis below at 31 March 2010.
Furthermore, the Groups controlling interest in this company was sold in June 2010.
Further details are provided in Notes 8 and 30.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2010 by the funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
This valuation resulted in a deficit of 137 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of 142.4 million reported at that date.
Future cash funding is expected to continue at 20 million per annum.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit plans.
This scheme is wholly funded.

These contributions ceased on 31 March 2010 on closure of this scheme to future service accrual.
The final cash contributions for March 2010 were paid over in April 2010.
In addition, from October 2009, the Group has been making additional funding contributions to the scheme of 20 million per annum.
This resulted in cash payments of 10 million in the year ended 31 March 2010 and 20 million in the year ended 31 March 2011.
The new schedule of contributions resulting from the full March 2010 actuarial valuation has not yet been formally adopted but no change is anticipated to the existing agreement of payments of 20 million per annum.
In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract.
A further insurance contract for retired members was purchased in June 2009 resulting in coverage for all members who retired up to August 2008.
These contracts are included within scheme assets and their value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
This will reduce the volatility of the reported defined benefit obligations in future periods.
The purchase of the second insurance contract in June 2009 was funded by the sale of equities.
Subsequently, in order to re-establish an appropriate equity weighting of scheme assets, the Fund purchased equity total return swaps synthetic equity.
These instruments comprise an asset leg and a liability leg.
The asset leg generates a return based on UK and overseas equity indices and the liability leg incurs a cost based on LIBOR plus margin.
At inception, the principal value of each leg was 200 million.
The positive valuation of synthetic equity at 31 March 2011 and 2010 reflects the underlying strength in equities subsequent to the swap purchase.
Credit risk is minimised since collateral is provided by the counterparties to the benefit of the Fund when the instruments are in the money.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 87 21 Retirement benefit obligations continued Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates with the exception of the insured retirement obligations which equal the IAS 19 valuation of obligations which they cover.
The expected rate of return on equities of 8.0% March 2010: 7.8% reflects historic UK equity returns with an assumption for 2011 that the equity market rally in 2010 11 will continue in the medium term.
The equity return assumption represents a reasonable risk premium of c. 3.5% over gilts.
It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
This return assumption is also applied to the equity leg on equity total return swaps.
The liability leg cost assumption is based upon medium-term LIBOR yields.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 5.2% March 2010: 5.1% is based upon the gross redemption yields available on a similar profile of gilts and corporate bonds.
The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years 2010: 19 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indices, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the schemes expected benefit payments.
In 2010 the Government announced that in future salary increases to deferred pensions in excess of guaranteed minimum pensions GMPs and to GMPs accrued after 6 April 1988 will be linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI instead of the Retail Prices Index RPI.
In the second half of the year ended 31 March 2011, having reviewed the Scheme rules and previous communications with members, the Trustee and Company concluded that no constructive obligations had been created counter to the Scheme rules and that therefore those rules would apply.
Under the Scheme rules RPI continues to be applied for pensions in payment but in future, statutory increases shall be applied for the majority of deferred members being CPI.
The result of this change, which has been communicated to members, is to reduce future pension inflation assumptions for deferred members when determining Scheme liabilities.
The impact has been to reduce Scheme liabilities by approximately 43 million.
The impact of this change, along with other actuarial valuation movements, has been taken to other comprehensive income.
The RPI inflation assumptions are determined by adopting a yield curve approach, based on the break-even rate of inflation implied by fixed interest gilt yields and index-linked yields.
Applying this approach to the Schemes projected benefit payments gives an average break-even inflation assumption of 3.5%.
The CPI inflation assumption is determined by reference to adjusted RPI rather than by reference to CPI-linked investments where the market is small and illiquid.
The principal differences between RPI and CPI are i the formula effect due to RPI using arithmetic means and CPI geometric means, and ii the bundles of goods considered CPI excludes mortgage payments and other housing costs.
On average, since 1999, RPI inflation has been approximately 0.7% points higher than CPI inflation with 0.5% due to the formula effect and 0.2% due to the components included.
The assumption used at 31 March 2011 is that CPI inflation will continue to track 0.7% points below RPI inflation and is therefore set at 2.8%.
Pension increase assumptions are based on RPI with an adjustment to reflect caps within the Scheme rules.
Mortality assumptions have been updated in the year ended 31 March 2011 based on analysis of the membership data performed as part of the March 2010 full actuarial valuation.
The result is an increase in life expectancy assumptions of approximately 1.7 years.
The scheme deficit is highly dependent upon these input assumptions which are set at the reporting period end dates.
A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 14 million 2010: 16 million.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 11 million 2010: 10 million.
An increase in life expectancy across all members of one year would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 40 million 2010: 24 million.
The net benefit expense for the year for Wexford Creamery Limited, included in the table above, amounted to nil 2010: 0.5 million.
The fair value of plan assets, the obligation and the net scheme deficit as at 31 March 2010 are disclosed in Note 8.
There were no material movements in the Wexford pension scheme liabilities between 31 March 2010 and the disposal of a controlling interest in that company in June 2010.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of other recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income and expense in relation to the Group pension plans.
The legal sponsor of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund is Dairy Crest Limited.
The Group has charged 7.8 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group defined contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2011 2010: 1.5 million.
The increase compared to last year results from the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future service accrual on 1 April 2010 and the subsequent increase in members of the defined contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2011.

During the year two new biomass boilers were installed at the Davidstow cheese manufacturing site.
Capital expenditure amounted to 3.9 million and we have received cash grants of 0.8 million during the year ended 31 March 2011 from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.
This grant is conditional upon certain conditions principally regarding continued use and ownership of the boilers until 29 November 2014.
Deferred income of 0.6 million relating to Wexford Creamery Limited was transferred into a disposal group held for sale during the year ended 31 March 2010 see Note 8.

The amount of the fine provided was 9.4 million plus legal fees and reflected the early resolution agreement that was reached with the OFT in December 2007.
In April 2010, the OFT announced that parties to the 2007 Statement of Objections will get a penalty reduction provided each company continues to co-operate with the OFT.
Accordingly, the provision has been reduced to reflect our best estimate of the penalty ultimately payable 7.1 million plus legal fees expected to be incurred 0.2 million.
This fine is dependent upon the Groups continued full co-operation with the OFT until the matter is settled.
Settlement is expected to be reached in the year ending 31 March 2012 and therefore the related provision has been classified as current.
Onerous contracts In June 2010, the Group disposed of 50% of the share capital of Wexford Creamery Limited WCL.
As part of the disposal, the Group entered into an agreement to purchase guaranteed minimum volumes of cheese from WCL for a period of five years from the date of disposal.
The price paid by the Group for that cheese is determined by reference to cost plus margin.
Realisations for commodity cheese fluctuate and at the date of disposal a provision of 3.6 million was charged in order to provide for the cost of the cheese purchase arrangements.
At 31 March 2011 the provision amounted to 3.0 million.
At 31 March 2009 the Group had one milk supply contract with a middle ground customer which, due to unprecedented increases in milk costs in 2007 08 and a subsequent weakening of cream prices, had became onerous.
The remaining provision of 0.5 million was utilised in the year ending 31 March 2010.

In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited.
Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each.
The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as 170.2 million.
The capital reserve of 142.7 million, shown in the statement of changes in equity, represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of 27.5 million.
27 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three-year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share or, on the 2006 to 2008 awards, economic profit.
From 2009, the TSR element was increased from 50% to 60% of the awards granted.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years.
On 28 June 2010 861,651 options were granted under the LTISP scheme June 2009: 1,062,106.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
The numbers 92 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Share based payment plans continued Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 26 June 2009 4,461,240 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a grant price of 227 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2011.
In addition, from 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares are charged over four years being the year the bonus related to and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at date of issue.
Deferred shares to the value of nil are to be issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2011 2010: 0.6 million.
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows: LTISP Sharesave scheme Weighted average exercise price Number Number pence Options outstanding at 1 April 2010 2,071,382 4,481,625 239.1 Options granted during the year 861,651 Reinvested dividends 138,480 Options exercised during the year 41,076 41,836 227.0 Options forfeited during the year 1,072,663 584,007 248.0 Options outstanding at 31 March 2011 1,957,774 3,855,782 237.8 Exercisable at 31 March 2011 26,976 Options outstanding at 1 April 2009 1,754,221 976,789 487.0 Options granted during the year 1,062,106 4,461,240 227.0 Reinvested dividends 134,713 Options exercised during the year 311,373 Options forfeited during the year 568,285 956,404 436.1 Options outstanding at 31 March 2010 2,071,382 4,481,625 239.1 Exercisable at 31 March 2010 64,719 The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.

LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to June 2020 March 2010: July 2019.
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2011 is 8.64 years for the LTISP and 1.86 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2010: 8.64 years and 2.85 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 3.73 2010: 3.55 and 3.76 on exercise of Sharesave options 2010: none were exercised.
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in June 2009 is 30% giving a fair value of 0.68 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the June 2009 grant were: Expected share price volatility 43%, risk-free rate of interest 2.4% and dividend yield 6.5%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2011.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 93 27 Share based payment plans continued The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in June 2010 is 73% for the TSR element and 100% for the EPS element June 2009: 75% TSR and 100% Economic Profit giving a fair value of 3.34 per option granted 2009: 2.74.
The share price on granting 2010 awards was 3.99 2009: 3.14.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on EPS and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2011 were as follows: Term 3 years 2010: 3 years Volatility 46% 2010: 47% Risk-free rate 1.3% 2010: 2.1% Average volatility of comparator TSR 52% 2010: 50% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 27% 2010: 26% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.

30 Business combinations and disposals Year ended 31 March 2011 Disposals On 12 June 2010 the Group sold 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited WCL for cash proceeds of 9 million.
This disposal was effected by way of a share repurchase by WCL.
At the same time, the Group entered into two option agreements over its remaining 30% ownership.
The first option agreement granted a five-year call option to the majority shareholder, being Wexford Milk Producers WMP, over 10% of WCL share capital for a fixed price of 1.8 million.
After five years the Group will have the right to exercise a put option at a fixed price of 1.8 million.
The combination of put and call options gives rise to near certainty of exercise and, along with the fixed option price, provides evidence that this option in substance comprises deferred consideration on a further 10% of the ordinary shares of WCL.
In substance the Group has affected a disposal of 60% of the shares of WCL with 10% of the consideration being deferred.
The amount of deferred consideration recorded at 12 June 2010 after conversion into Sterling and appropriate discounting was 1.3 million.
The carrying amount at 31 March 2011 was 1.4 million.
The second option agreement granted an eight-year call option to WMP over 20% of the WCL share capital for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of post-tax profits, excluding WCL share buy-back financing costs.
After eight years the Group will have the right to exercise a put option based on the same pricing formula.
The swap was initially valued at 1.6 million and there have been no material movements in the valuation in the period to 31 March 2011.
The completion arrangements included a five-year cheese supply agreement with the Group agreeing to buy minimum guaranteed cheese volumes based on a cost plus margin formula.
Volumes decrease over the five-year agreement.
At the transaction date, 3.6 million was charged by the Group in order to provide for the cost of the cheese purchase arrangements.
The balance of this provision at 31 March 2011 was 3.0 million.
The disposal resulted in the release of non-controlling interests in WCL 2.8 million and in the reclassification to profit and loss of net investment hedges previously taken to other comprehensive income 1.7 million.
Furthermore, the Group incurred 0.2 million on legal and professional fees in relation to this disposal.

Year ended 31 March 2010 On 20 June 2009, the Group completed the sale of 16 depots to Medina Dairy Limited.
The Group retained supply of packed milk into these depots and ownership of land and buildings where relevant.
Proceeds amounted to 1.4 million and the Group incurred fees and other costs of 0.2 million resulting in a net cash inflow of 1.2 million.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2009, Group revenues would have been 1,632.1 million and Group profit for the year would have been 52.6 million.
No material fair value adjustments were made to the book value of assets acquired as accounting policies were consistent with Group policies and no further recognisable intangible assets were identified.
Factors affecting goodwill include the benefits that might accrue to the wider Dairy Crest Group from future new product development.
31 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash flows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: to maintain flexibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20.
At 31 March 2011 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 638.1 million 2010: 648.5 million excluding finance leases of 9.6 million 2010: 11.8 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 11.8 million 2010: 20.5 million.
The facilities at both 31 March 2011 and 2010 consisted of: 85 million plus 175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013: 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: and loan notes totalling 298.2 million 2010: 307.4 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
The numbers 98 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2011 amounted to 274.4 million 2010: 275.1 million.
This can be analysed as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Drawn down Facility Drawn down Facility m m m m November 2006 five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 65.5 100.0 66.0 100.0 July 2008 five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 239.9 241.1 Total 65.5 339.9 66.0 341.1 Headroom 274.4 275.1 Cash and short-term deposits 49.9 20.0 Effective headroom 324.3 295.1 The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
The increased focus on cash generation over the three years ended 31 March 2011 has resulted in significantly lower levels of borrowings and increased facility headroom.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long-term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued fixed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its floating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash flow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2011, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, 100% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 2010: 100%.
The proportion of fixed interest borrowings is higher than our long-term target, however interest rate swaps against borrowings of 74 million 2010: 74 million will expire in November 2011 and, depending on borrowing requirements at that time, the proportion of fixed rate borrowings will then reduce in the future.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 99 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invests.
The foreign operations hedged in this way are St Hubert SAS France and until its classification into a disposal group held for sale in March 2010, Wexford Creamery Limited Ireland : St Hubert is a Euro-denominated subsidiary.
Our policy is to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible fixed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure of overseas subsidiaries through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
At present, our only currency exposure is Euros.
At 31 March 2011 and 2010, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross-currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
This can be seen in Note 17 that the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the functional currency of St Hubert.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US with a face value of $233 million.
At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash flows.
These have the effect of fixing the liability in Sterling at 133 million.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on 75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future interest and principal repayment cash flows.
This has the effect of fixing the liability in Sterling at 67 million.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to this 75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassification of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy which is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee.
The numbers 100 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
The Customer Direct doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 212.0 million 2010: 175.3 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2011 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times March 2010: 2.4 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2011 or 2010.
There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The definition of net debt is included in Note 34.
The gearing ratio at March 2011 and 2010 can be analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m Net debt 311.6 337.2 Shareholders funds 365.5 292.8 Gearing ratio 85% 115% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 2.0 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend for 2010 11 is 14.2 pence representing a 4% increase on last year 2010: 13.6 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 amount to 19.7 pence, representing an increase of 4% 2010: 18.9 pence.

Consolidated Interest rate maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash flow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2011 and 2010, all Group borrowings were at fixed rates of interest see Note 31.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative floating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash flow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative floating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to floating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The numbers 104 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2011 was 74.0 million 65.5 million 2010: 74.0 million 66.0 million.
Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The floating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these swaps is EURIBOR 2010: EURIBOR.
The hedged item is the interest cash flows on 74 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facilities at floating EURIBOR the margin is not hedged.

These cross-currency swaps have both legs at fixed interest rates, are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2011 and 2010 the fixed interest rates varied from 5.305% to 5.315%.
The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next two to five years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross-currency swap contracts at 31 March 2011 was 75.0 million 67.0 million 2010: 75.0 million 67.0 million.
At 31 March 2011 and 2010 the fixed interest rates varied from 4.955% to 5.180%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next three to four years being the life of the swaps.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2011 was 131.9 million 2010: 132.9 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 1.0 million 2010: 6.0 million on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated as cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then be reclassified to the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2011 of 274.4 million 2010: 275.1 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
These undrawn facilities expire in November 2011 34.5 million and July 2013 239.9 million.

Under IFRS, currency borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
The crosscurrency swaps are recorded at fair value Note 32 and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group defines net debt so as to include the effective Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.
The 11.8 million adjustment included above 2010: 20.5 million converts the Sterling equivalent of Dollar and Euro loan notes from year end exchange rates 211.7 million 2010: 220.5 million to the fixed Sterling liability 200.0 million 2010: 200.0 million.

The manufacturing process is currently split between Kirkby and Crudgington, Shropshire.
This consolidation will result in approximately 90 redundancies at Crudgington and the creation of approximately 45 jobs at Kirkby.
The consolidation is not expected to be completed until 2012.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment at Crudgington affected by this change continues to be supported by the underlying value in use and therefore no impairment has been recognised at 31 March 2011.
