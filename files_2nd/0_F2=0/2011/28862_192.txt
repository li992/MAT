Impairment review The Group's goodwill acquired in business combinations is reviewed annually at 30 September for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit CGU to which goodwill has been allocated with its carrying value.
The CGUs of the Group, excluding RFS Holdings minority interest, where the goodwill is significant, principally arose on the acquisitions of NatWest, ABN AMRO, Charter One and Churchill and are as follows: Recoverable amount 2011 2010 2009 Goodwill at 30 September based on m m m UK Retail Value in use 2,697 2,697 2,697 UK Corporate Value in use 2,693 2,693 2,693 Wealth Value in use 611 611 611 Global Transaction Services Value in use 2,370 2,376 2,749 US Retail & Commercial Value in use 2,826 2,811 2,761 RBS Insurance Value in use 935 935 935 371 RBS Group 2011 Notes on the consolidated accounts continued 17 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of UK Corporate, based on a 3% 2010 - 3%: Impairment testing involves the comparison of the carrying value of a 2009 - 4% terminal growth rate and a 14.1% 2010 - 15.6%: 2009 - CGU or group of CGUs with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable 15.1% pre tax discount rate, exceeded its carrying value by 2.1 billion amount is the higher of the unit's fair value and its value in use.
A 1% change in the discount rate use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the CGU or or terminal growth rate would change the recoverable amount by group of CGUs.
Fair value is the amount obtainable from the sale of the approximately 1.1 billion 2010 - 1.6 billion: 2009 - 1.4 billion and CGU in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing 0.5 billion 2010 and 2009 - 0.9 billion respectively.
