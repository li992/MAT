The Sovereign property portfolio on acquisition was valued at approximately 67.9m.
Grainger Equity Release Limited GERL paid 34.2m for 100% of the issued share capital of Sovereign excluding acquisition costs.
The fair value of assets and liabilities was 73.1m and 34.4m respectively.
The fair value of net assets acquired was therefore 38.7m.
The resulting gain on acquisition of 4.5m was credited to the 2010 income statement in line with IFRS 3 Revised.

Subsequent to the 2010 Grainger year end, on 12 October 2010, GERL received a cash consideration of 17.5m from Moorfield for a 50% stake in Sovereign valued at 19.2m.
The group provided for the resulting loss of 1.7m in its 2010 financial statements.
In accordance with IFRS 5 all of the assets and liabilities of Sovereign at 30 September 2010 were classified as a disposal group held-forsale.
This is because the disposal group met the two criteria set out in IFRS 5 of being available-for-sale in its present condition and the sale being highly probable.

On 21 November 2011 the group signed a further agreement with Partnership Assurance for an additional 28.6m of debt funding under similar terms to the initial 50.3m.
These facilities are repayable on a property-by-property basis as the assets are sold on vacancy, with interest rolling up.
In this way the facility exactly matches the cash flow characteristics of this part of the business, with an expected average maturity of 11 years.
These funds are being used to reduce the groups core debt facilities.
