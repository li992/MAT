Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements C1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods.
After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections, the directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Companys accounting policies in relation to operating leases, share-based payments, translation of foreign currencies, property, plant and equipment, taxation and derivative financial instruments are set out in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
Other accounting policies which are specific to the Company are set out below.
a Share-based payments Where the Company has granted rights to its equity to employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation to equity settled sharebased payment arrangements the contribution to the subsidiary undertakings is recognised as an additional investment.
b Investments Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
c Post-retirement benefits It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme to the Company on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Company has therefore accounted for its contributions to the defined benefit section of the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The Companys contributions to the defined contribution section of the pension scheme are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as they become payable.
C2 Directors and auditors remuneration Details of directors remuneration, share interests, share options, pensions and other entitlements, which form part of these financial statements, are given in the parts of the directors Remuneration Report which are described as having been audited.

Dixons Retail plc 114 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements C11 Post-retirement benefits The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a defined benefit and defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to all eligible employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
This shortfall and the associated recovery plan have been agreed in principle with the trustee of the scheme with formal agreement expected shortly.
The proposed recovery plan based on this valuation commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million which rise to 16.0 million in 2011 12, 20.0 million for 2012 13 and 2013 14 and rising approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 31 March 2013.
At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
The valuation of the defined benefit section for the purposes of IAS 19 showed a gross pension deficit before deferred tax of 244.0 million 2010 263.5 million and 2009 148.8 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the Group financial statements.
C12 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Company is exposed to liquidity, interest rate, exchange, credit and capital risks and adopts the same approach to the management of these risks as the Group as set out in the Directors Report and in note 22 to the Group financial statements.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes C5 and C8, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15 to the Group financial statements.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note C12 d. Included in trade and other receivables is 18.3 million 2010 25.0 million and 2009 30.3 million relating to interest rate swaps held to hedge fair value interest rate risk.

Dixons Retail plc 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in interest rates on derivative financial instruments and certain monetary items.
The sensitivity analysis reflects the position as at 30 April 2011 and 1 May 2010 respectively, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in interest rates affect the Companys loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of floating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR.
The following sensitivity analysis shows a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant and the corresponding decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 5.9 million 2009 10 a 6.7 million negative effect on profit before tax and equity.
Assumptions used in calculating the sensitivity analysis are set out in note 22 e to the Group financial statements.
