Hochschild Mining plc 24 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Operating & exploration review Main operations Arcata: Peru Production and sales Arcata Arcata is located in the Department of Arequipa in southern Peru Peru.
It is a 100% owned underground operation that 6,081 koz silver commenced production in 1964.
17.38 koz gold 7,124 koz silver equivalent During 2011, the Company continued to adjust the extractiongrades at Arcata towards the average reserve grade level in order to ensure a consistent and sustainable level ofproduction.
Full year silver equivalent production of 7.1million ounces was 26% lower than 2010 9.6 million ounces.
The Company took advantage of strong metal prices to processwaste material from previous campaigns see table below on Macarena Waste Dam Deposit.
This material, whilstincreasing overall annual treated tonnage by 7% Resource life to687,966 tonnes 2010:645,974 tonnes, was processed The resource life of Arcata stands at 11.5 years as at atadecreased average silver grade of 95 g t. In addition, 31December 2011, up 20%, from 9.6 years in 2010, following in2011 the Company mined in the lower grade border an intensive drill campaign focused on the Baja, Marion, areaswith associated narrower veins and increased dilution.
Blanca, Amparo, Lucrecia and Tunel 4 veins.
In total, 94,656 This additional material was not part ofArcatas resource base.
metres of diamond drilling was completed during the year In Q4 2011, the first stage of the project to convert 40% of 1 2010: 76,506 metres with significant intercepts including : Arcatas concentrate into dore was successfully completed.
Thesecond stage of the project will be completed in H2 Marion DDH-028 3.03m at 3.88 g t Au and 1,008 g t Ag 2012and subsequently 100% of Arcatas concentrate will be DDH-099 1.90m at 5.18 g t Au and 1,704 g t Ag converted into dore.
As a result of the metallurgical recoveries DDH-057 2.35m at 4.08 g t Au and 1,183 g t Ag involved in the process, there will be an estimated reduction inproduction in 2012 of 291,000 silver equivalent ounces.
Amparo DDH-935 2.97m at 3.29 g t Au and 1,736 g t Ag Total investment for the project is approximately $14 million DDH-039 3.36m at 2.06 g t Au and 751 g t Ag and the Company believes that this will be a highly profitable Blanca DDH-079 1.17m at 8.35 g t Au and 3,171 g t Ag project as the resulting decrease in refining fees, commercial DDH-914 0.85m at 4.28 g t Au and 2,579 g t Ag discounts and associated selling expenses will more than offset the treatment costs associated with the process.
Baja DDH-250 1.09m at 5.19 g t Au and 706 g t Ag In 2012, the exploration drilling campaign of 62,756 metres Costs will focus on the targeting of higher grade structures and Unit cost per tonne, excluding royalties, increased by 8% to increasing the mine resource base.
Including royalties, the increase in 2011 was also 8% at $77.0 per tonne 2010: $71.1.
Key drivers were a rise in the number of contractors employed in the mine due to the increased number of stopes, higher wage costs in line with industry inflation and higher diesel prices.
These effects were partly offset by energy cost savings achieved following price renegotiations and by economies of scale resulting fromthe increase in treated tonnage.
In 2011, the silver gold concentrate from Arcata was sold toCormin, Korea Zinc Co. Ltd and MRI Trading Ag.
10% ofArcatas production was processed into dore: all of which was sold to Johnson Matthey in 2011.

Operating & exploration review 25 Pallancata: Peru Production and sales Pallancata The Pallancata silver gold property is located in the Department Peru of Ayacucho in southern Peru, approximately 160 kilometres 8,767 koz silver from the Arcata operation.
Pallancata commenced production 33.88 koz gold in2007 and is a joint venture with International Minerals 10,800 koz silver equivalent Corporation in which Hochschild controls 60% andisthe mineoperator.
Ore from Pallancata is transported 22kilometres to the Selene plant for processing.
In 2011, full year production at Pallancata was 10.8 million silver equivalent ounces 2010: 12.3 million, a decrease of12%.
Although treated tonnage remained broadly flat compared to 2010, there was a fall in grades reflecting higher dilution from narrower veins, as well as the Companys decision to take advantage of the prevailing high precious metals In addition, the Company incurred higher mine service priceenvironment to process some lower grade economic costs transportation, energy and equipment hire reflecting material extracted from the borders of the main Pallancata increased diesel prices and the development of new mine vein.
This additional material was not part of Pallancatas areas.
A number of cost initiatives partially offset these factors, resource base.
including a change to the mine backfill process leading to lower cement consumption, as well as cost efficiencies in Costs explosives consumption.
Excluding mine royalties, unit cost per tonne increased by 18%, to $54.5 per tonne 2010: $46.2.
Including royalties, In 2011, the silver gold concentrate from Pallancata was sold theincrease in 2011 was 17%, to $60.4 per tonne 2010:$51.8.
to Teck Metals Ltd. Aurubis and LS-Nikko Copper.
This rise was principally due to increased wage costsresulting from industry inflation.
Resource life The resource life of the Pallancata operation stands at 7.4 years as at 31 December 2011, up 7% compared to 2010 6.9 years.
View of the camp at Pallancata During 2011, a total of 50,748 metres of diamond drilling was carried out over the course of the year 2010: 46,547 metres, mainly focused on the San Javier, Virgen del Carmen, Rina, Luisa, Pallancata West and Huararani veins with intercepts 1 including : Luisa DLLU-A08 9.0m at 1.61 g t Au and 301 g t Ag 3.25m at 4.89 g t Au and 1,382 g t Ag DLLU-015 8.4m at 2.79 g t Au and 565 g t Ag DLLU-A01 0.99m at 40.66 g t Au and 670 g t Ag Pallancata West DLPL-A796 4.16m at 6.08 g t Au and1,484g t Ag Yanina DLVC-010 0.77m at 6.10 g t Au and 1,300 g t Ag Rina DLRI-A21 1.72m at 6.12 g t Au and 1,614 g t Ag DLRI-A40 10.36m at 2.76 g t Au and 812 g t Ag Huararani DLPL-A745 4.4m at 18.45 g t Au and 954 g t Ag The 2012 exploration programme at Pallancata will target new mineralised structures to the north, west and south of the main operation area, with 59,140 metres of drilling planned.

San Jose commenced production in 2007 and 80.95 koz gold isa joint venture with McEwen Mining Inc formerly Minera 10,727 koz silver equivalent Andes Inc.. Hochschild controls 51% of the joint venture andis the mine operator.
San Jose delivered a robust performance in 2011, with silverequivalent production up 3% to 10.7 million ounces 2010: 10.4 million ounces.
This was mainly a result of an anticipated increase in silver grades, as well as operational efficiencies that led to an increase in recovery rates to 89% forgold and 86% for silver an increase of approximately The Company expects cost increases in 2012 to be in the range 5%for both gold and silver compared to 2010.
Silver grades of 2530%, in line with the above mentioned local inflation.

Including royalties, the increase in 2011 was 19%, at $181.7 per tonne 2010: $152.3.
Local inflation After a successful drilling campaign in the first half of 2011, inArgentina continues to run at between 25% and 30% and thesecond half of the year was dedicated to completing consequently the key driver of the rise in costs was wage cost geophysical and magnetometry work in order to identify new inflation.
A higher consumption of reagents also contributed targets at the property.
This work was successfully completed to the increase in costs although this was offset by a significant and provided areas of potential that were targeted in the improvement in recoveries.
