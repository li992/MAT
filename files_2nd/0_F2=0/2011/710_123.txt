The agreed price for the transactions was based upon the average gold price for the two month period prior to the sale.
As at December 31, 2011 an amount of $535,721 was receivable by the Group.
The outstanding amount was received in full by the Group in January 2012.
During the prior financial year an agreement entered into with Minesite Constructions, a Company in which Mr. Caruso is a shareholder and Director, for the hire of mining equipment was terminated prior to their scheduled expiry date.
Prior to its termination, the agreement was accounted for as a finance lease.
Under the terms of the leases, the Group had the option to acquire the leased assets for their agreed fair value on expiry of the leases.
The agreement was terminated effective April 1, 2010.
The provisional amount payable by the Group in consequence of the termination of the agreement was AUD$6,466,764 which exceeded the recorded value of the lease liability of AUD$3,575,727 as at the termination date.
The excess of the termination value over the lease liability of AUD$2,891,037 was recorded in Statement of Comprehensive Income under financing costs.
The final amount payable for the mining equipment acquired as a consequence of the termination of the agreement was determined based on an independent valuation of the mining equipment.
The leases also provided for the payment of contingent rentals determined on the basis of a fixed charge per machine hour.
