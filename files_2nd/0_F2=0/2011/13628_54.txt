Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to business segment.
A segment level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below.
2011 2010 Controls 8,967 6,828 Fluid Systems 23,020 21,436 Gears 7,793 7,643 Instruments 28,679 68,459 35,907 The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three year plan.
The three year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which reflects the Long Term nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
The discount rate used is 9.8% 2010: 12.1%, this represents a reasonable rate for a market participant in this sector.
The majority of the discount rate reduction is due to the movement in 10 year bond yields on which the risk free rate is based.
The discount rate of each business segment is not materially different to 9.8%.
For the Goodwill to become impaired in the CGU with the minimum headroom, the discount rate would have to increase to 25.8%.
On this basis each business segment has sufficient headroom and therefore no impairment write downs are required.
