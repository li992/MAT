Details of the deferred bonus shares awarded are given on page 66 of this report.
Pension benefits include non-bonusable salary supplements and target funding payments which are paid direct to the executive.

Mr Allan received 196,000 of expatriate benefits during the year and was also paid a nonpensionable and non-bonusable overseas premium of 77,500, relating to his position in Singapore.
The company deducts a hypothetical tax equivalent to UK tax rates on Mr Allans salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive payments.
This is offset against local Singapore tax due.
As the maximum tax rate in Singapore is lower than in the UK, the difference is retained by the company.
