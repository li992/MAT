Credit Risk continued Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 2011 2010 000 000 Fixed interest investments 26,236 20,151 Cash and short term deposits 30,021 39,497 Debtors and prepayments 1,947 1,316 58,204 60,964 The maximum exposure in fixed interest investments was 30,587,000 2010 27,331,000 and the minimum 20,059,000 2010 20,041,000.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
C. Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to provide a degree of flexibility so that the portfolio can be repositioned when appropriate and that most of the assets can be realised without an excessive discount to the market price.
a Equity Securities The Companys unlisted investments are not readily realisable, but these only amount to 1.8% of the Companys total assets at 31 December 2011 2010 0.7%.
In practice, liquidity in investee companies is imperfect, particularly those with a market value of less than 100 million.
To reduce this liquidity risk it is the policy to diversify the holdings and generally to restrict the holding in any one company to less than 10% of the share capital of that company.
Furthermore the guideline is for no single investment to account for more than 5% of the assets of the Company.
The market valuation of each underlying security gives an indication of value, but the price at which an investment can be made or realised can diverge materially from the bid or offer price depending on market conditions generally and particularly to each investment.
34% 168 million 2010 32% 160 million of the portfolio is invested in listed stocks with a market capitalisation below 100 million, where liquidity is expected to be more limited.
If these stocks had on average a realisable value 20% below the bid price the value of the total fund would be adversely affected by 6.9% 2010 6.4%.
b Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap The fair value of the swap is estimated by RBS the provider of the swap and is compared to an external model and external prices.
Previously, the primary valuation method has been to use an external model with external prices source: Bloomberg, which is then compared to the swap providers valuation.
Historically the difference has been within an acceptable tolerance, however there was a divergence at 31 December 2011 between the RBS valuation and the external model.
The RBS capital valuation was 20,357,842 in comparison to the external model of 19,850,744.
As the RBS valuation was lower this figure has been used as the appropriate fair value.
However RBS have acknowledged that they have changed their valuation methodology and assumptions during the year, but have not disclosed the details, and furthermore may change these at any time as the following RBS disclaimer highlights.
RBS has produced this valuation as of a particular time and date on the basis of, inter alia, its proprietary valuation models or those of third party providers, the assumptions made therein, relevant market data including data from third party sources and its assessment in its sole discretion of the factors relevant to the valuation and may be changed at any time at RBS sole discretion without notice to you.
Provision of this valuation does not constitute either a bid or an offer for securities, or a bid or an offer to unwind a transaction.
If RBS agrees to quote a live price to unwind a transaction or to trade a security, such live price is likely to differ from the most recent valuation for such transaction or security, as the case may be, and may be more unfavourable to you.
Valuations and quotations may differ materially between dealers.
The swap valuation gives an indication of fair value, but the price at which the swap can be unwound or realised may diverge materially from this valuation depending on market conditions and liquidity.

The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on pages 40 and 41.
