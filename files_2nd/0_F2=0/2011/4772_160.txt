e Other financial liabilities On 20 December 2002, Dignity 2002 Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan into fixed rate.
Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16 a, the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest.
These notes replaced the bank loan.
Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the Secured Notes.
As a result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the Group makes fixed and determinable biannual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement.
This master agreement forces the swaps to be viewed and settled on a net basis only: a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability.
The fair value represents the discounted net present value of future cash flows.
Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has been accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance with IAS 39. f Crematoria Acquisition Facility The Group also has a 10 million Crematoria Acquisition Facility the Crematoria Acquisition Facility.
7.4 million carries interest at 5.59 per cent per annum.
The remaining 2.6 million carries interest at a rate relative to three month LIBOR, with such rate being capped at 5.59 per cent.
Consequently, the Group carries limited risk to increases in LIBOR on this facility.
The Crematoria Acquisition Facility is fully drawn and will be repayable in one payment in November 2013.
The transaction costs incurred on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility were 0.2 million.
The principal outstanding on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility and related issue costs have been presented on a net basis in the table above.
At 30 December 2011, 10.0 million 2010: 10.0 million of the principal was outstanding.
At 30 December 2011, 0.1 million 2010: 0.1 million of the transaction costs remained unamortised.
