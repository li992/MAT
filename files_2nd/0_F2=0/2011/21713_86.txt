BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2011 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued a Price Risk continued Price sensitivity The Company invests substantially all its assets in AllBlue and does not undertake any significant structural borrowing or hedging activity at the Company level.
Its performance is therefore directly linked to the net asset value of AllBlue, which itself is driven by the net asset values of the underlying funds, each of which hold a large number of positions in listed and unlisted securities.
At 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 for comparative, if the net asset value of AllBlue had been 10% higher lower with all other variables held constant, the net assets attributable to shareholders for the year would have increased decreased as stated below, arising due to the increase decrease in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

b Credit Risk The nature of commercial arrangements made in the normal course of business between many prime brokers and custodians means that in the case of any one prime broker or custodian defaulting on its obligations to AllBlue or any of the underlying funds, the effects of such a default may have negative effects on other prime brokers with whom AllBlue or such underlying fund deals.
The underlying funds and, by extension, AllBlue and the Company may, therefore, be exposed to systemic risk when AllBlue or an underlying fund deals with prime brokers and custodians whose creditworthiness may be interlinked.
