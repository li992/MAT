RISK MANAGEMENT Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may raise capital from shareholders or restructure its borrowings.
consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as debt divided by equity.
Debt represents total borrowings including current and noncurrent borrowings as shown in the statement of financial position, less cash and cash equivalents.
Equity represents equity as shown in the statement of financial position.
69 Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements The gearing ratios at 31 December 2011 and 2010 were as follows: As at 31 December 2011 2010 Note $000 $000 Total borrowings 25 49,038 47,906 less: cash and cash equivalents 22 117,567 56,297 Total net cash 68,529 8,391 Total equity 521,454 408,016 Total capital 452,925 399,625 Gearing ratio 15.1% 2.1% Under the terms of the new loan agreement Note 32, the Group is subject to three financial covenants and a number of general covenants.
The financial covenants are tested on a rolling 12 month basis from June 2012.
Major categories of financial instruments The Group has various financial assets such as trade and other accounts receivable, Eurobonds, cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade and other accounts payable.
In 2011 the Group enhanced the risk management policies in respect of efficient use of temporarily free cash surpluses, with the major part of cash being held on short-term deposits and minor investments in highly liquid short-term marketable securities.
The group has adopted the policy of only dealing with low-risk securities with high credit ratings provided by independent rating agencies.
The financial ability of existing investments and overall market circumstances are continuously monitored by management.
On 6 May 2011, the Group purchased Eurobonds issued by the EBRD for a total consideration of $15,399 thousand.
According to Standard & poors independent rating agency the bonds have an AAA credit rating.
The financial instruments are denominated in RUR with a fixed interest rate of 6% and matured in February 2012 Note 32.
These financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method with interest income recognised by applying the effective interest rate.
The difference between the consideration paid and the carrying amount as of 31 December 2011 relates to the allocation of interest income and premium using the amortised cost method and a foreign exchange loss arising on the revaluation of bonds at the reporting date since they are deemed to be monetary items denominated in foreign currency.
Cash is placed in financial institutions which are considered to have minimal risk of default, considered based on ratings set out by independent rating agencies and is held mainly on short-term deposits.
As at 31 December 2011 2010 Note $000 $000 Financial assets cash and cash equivalents 22 117,567 56,297 Eurobonds 21 13,561 - Trade and other receivables 20 3,907 4,103 loans to employees 21 - 1,352 Total financial assets 135,035 61,752 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 24 22,796 7,020 Borrowings 25 49,038 47,906 Total financial liabilities 71,834 54,926 70 Exillon Energy Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency, commodity price risk, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.
Commodity price risk The groups operating results are affected by changes in world oil prices which are dependent on general and specific market conditions.
A decrease in oil prices generally has a negative impact on the groups operating results and vice-versa.
The group manages the exposure to commodity prices risk by optimising its core activities in order to achieve stable margins.
The group has not entered into any hedging arrangements in respect of its commodity price exposures.
A decrease in oil prices of 10% would have led to a decrease in profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 of $5,426 thousand 2010: $1,042 thousand.
The sensitivity of oil prices are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance of the group.
Interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings and short-term bank deposits.
Groups borrowings are exposed to interest rate risk which impact cash flows and profit or loss.
If the interest rate had increased by 100 base points for the year ended 31 December 2011, interest paid would have been $507 thousand higher 2010: nil : the Groups net loss would have been $62 thousand higher 2010: $104 thousand in relation to the portion of borrowing costs, which have not been capitalised during the period.
Short-term bank deposits bear no significant interest rate risk due to short maturity.
Credit risk credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from default.
In 2011, the Group introduced a prepayment scheme dealing with customers.
The Group only transacts with entities that demonstrate strong financial ability or are rated the equivalent of investment grade.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the management for each customer individually.
The groups credit risk principally arises from cash and cash equivalents and from credit exposures of its customers relating to outstanding trade and other receivables.
Cash is placed in financial institutions which are considered at time of deposit to have minimal risk of default.
As at 31 December 2011 2010 Note $000 $000 Cash and cash equivalents counterparties with external credit rating: Aaa ru S&P 74,606 - A S&P 27,726 - Aa1 Moodys 7,141 43,850 Aa2 Moodys 728 5,330 Aa3 Moodys 6,770 1,672 Baa1 Moodys - 3,835 cash on hand 596 1,610 Total cash and cash equivalents 22 117,567 56,297 The rating is attributable to the banks incorporated in the russian Federation.

The groups liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed.
The group has in place a detailed budgeting and cash forecasting process to help ensure that it has adequate cash available to meet its payment obligations.
