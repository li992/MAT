The Finance Act 2011 introduced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 and this rate is required to be used in calculating deferred tax provisions at the balance sheet date.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main corporation tax rate of 1% each year reducing the main tax rate down to 23% by April 2014.
From the previously announced main rate of corporation tax of 27%, the reduction to 25% from 1 April 2012 has resulted in a deferred tax credit in the income statement of 1.5m.
Of the 1.5m, 0.7m has been reported as non-trading as 1% of the total 2% reduction in the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012 is of a one-off nature and does not reflect the underlying trend in tax rate movements.
The future 1% main tax rate reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the underlying trading tax rate as the current year, however the actual impact will be dependent on the Groups deferred tax position at that time.

52 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 10 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 28 December 2009 26,241 1 Additional consideration 192 At 2 and 3 January 2011 and 1 January 2012 26,433 1 The additional consideration represents amounts paid to the previous shareholders of Brunning and Price Limited, as agreed under the terms of the purchase agreement, being monies received on outstanding negotiations relating to the pre-acquisition period.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to the carrying value.
The goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.4% 2010: 9.5% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is 50.4m 2010: 50.4m.
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available.

Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited has an accounting year end date of 31 March and as there is no material benefit in making the accounting year end co-terminus with the Group, no change has been made.
As a result of a detailed review of the trading performance of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, the investment has been recorded at nil and a loan note of 10.4m plus outstanding interest receivable due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, was fully provided against as at 1 January 2012 and 2 January 2011.
The Groups share of the post-tax result of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012 was a profit of 0.12m 2010: loss of 0.18m.
This profit has not been recognised in the income statement, in accordance with IAS 28 Associates and Joint Ventures as the investment has a carrying value of nil and the Groups share of the cumulative earnings of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited remains negative.

Date of Award Date by which Deposited Shares must be acquired 5 March 2009 30 June 2009 4 March 2010 30 June 2010 16 March 2011 30 June 2011 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
The Conditional and Matching awards granted on 6 March 2008 became exercisable on the publication of the 2010 results.
The vesting criteria for the Total Shareholder Return TSR element of the Conditional award were met in full and consequently, 100% of this part of the award vested.
Earnings per share EPS growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 results was between RPI 4% and RPI 10% and consequently, 82.5% of the EPS element of the Conditional award and the Matching award vested.
For those awards granted on 5 March 2009 that vest in 2012, the performance criteria was based on TSR.
The Restaurant Group plc was the highest ranked company for TSR in its comparator sector and consequently the award will vest in full for the remaining participants.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

In order to calculate volatility, the movement in the return index share price plus dividends re-invested over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated.
For the discount for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3 years prior to the grant has been used.

The Group borrows at floating rates and during 2010 used interest rate swaps to manage the interest profile.
In February 2011, the Directors decided to take advantage of the benign and stable interest rate environment and the Groups falling level of debt and terminated the Groups remaining interest rate swap for a payment of 0.4m.
This resulted in a 0.2m non-trading credit in the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012 2010: 0.6m credit.
Management pay rigorous attention to treasury management requirements and continue to: ff ensure sufficient committed loan facilities are in place to support anticipated business requirements: ff ensure the Groups debt service will be supported by anticipated cash flows and that covenants will be complied with: and ff manage interest rate exposure with a combination of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps when deemed appropriate.
The Board closely monitors the Groups treasury strategy and the management of treasury risk.
Further details on the business risk factors that are considered to affect the Group and more specific financial risk management including sensitivity to increases in interest rates are included in the report of the Directors on pages 18 to 25.
Further details on market and economic risk are included in the Chief Executive Officers review of operations on pages 6 to 11.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.02% 2010: 1.30% and 2.98% after taking into account the impact of interest rates swaps in place at the time.
62 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued a Financial assets and liabilities continued In October 2011, the Group agreed a new five year 140m loan facility which replaced the previous 120m facility.
This facility provides the Group with medium-term security of funding, additional capacity to take advantage of business opportunities as they become available and the flexibility to optimise the Groups funding structure.
The covenants and obligations of the new facility remain the same as the previous agreement and interest remains payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
As a result of the early termination of the old loan facility arrangement, the Group has recorded a non-trading charge of 0.2m for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 1 January 2012 the Group has 87.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 2 January 2011: 70.0m and 10.0m of undrawn overdraft 2 January 2011: 10.0m of undrawn overdraft.
The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 1 January 2012 Trade and other Finance payables Floating lease excluding tax rate loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 72,359 18,292 326 90,977 Within two to five years 40,340 1,303 41,643 After five years 6,148 6,148 72,359 58,632 7,777 138,768 Less: Future interest payments 6,797 4,645 11,442 72,359 51,835 3,132 127,326 At 2 January 2011 Trade and other Finance payables Floating lease excluding tax rate loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 68,997 926 296 70,219 Within two to five years 51,170 1,184 52,354 After five years 6,016 6,016 68,997 52,096 7,496 128,589 Less: Future interest payments 2,434 4,428 6,862 68,997 49,662 3,068 121,727 Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for two years.
The fixed rate for the duration of the two years was 2.70%.
On 17 January 2011 the interest rate swap expired.
Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for three years.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years was 2.975%.
On 9 February 2011 the interest rate swap was terminated on payment of 0.4m.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities At 1 January 2012, the Group had no derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps.
At 2 January 2011 the Group had two interest rate swaps in place which were held at fair value.
All financial assets and liabilities, excluding any interest rate swaps, are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2011 63 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m plus interest due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limiteds bank.
In 2007, following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 12.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in October 2016 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on pages 24 and 25. d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in the 52 weeks to 1 January 2012, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group no longer has an interest rate swap, following the early repayment of the swap scheduled to terminate in 2012, as the reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
64 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 24 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Present value Minimum of minimum lease payments lease payments 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Within one year 326 296 326 296 Within two to five years 1,303 1,184 998 907 After five years 6,148 6,016 1,808 1,865 7,777 7,496 Less: Future interest payments 4,645 4,428 Present value of lease obligations 3,132 3,068 3,132 3,068 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 326 296 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,806 2,772 Present value of lease obligations 3,132 3,068 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.1m 2010: 3.1m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2011 2011 2010 2010 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 51,558 3,401 47,719 3,399 Within two to five years 179,517 10,248 170,417 11,124 After five years 384,059 26,673 372,325 28,682 615,134 40,322 590,461 43,205 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
25 Capital commitments 2011 2010 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 13,975 13,251 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2011 65 Notes to the accounts continued 26 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
27 Related party transactions Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding.
A loan note of 10.4m is due from LV Finance, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR.
During the year ended 1 January 2012, 0.2m of interest was accrued of which the Group recognised 0.1m 2010: 0.1m of which the Group recognised nil.
Consequently in addition to the loan note of 10.4m, at 1 January 2012 0.5m of interest receivable was still outstanding, of which, under the terms of the agreement, all was overdue.
Further details are provided in note 12.
