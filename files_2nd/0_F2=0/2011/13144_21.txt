sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
in particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflationand life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: decrease increase in annual net pension expense 3 decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 168 increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: increase decrease in annual net pension expense 5 increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 94 increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: increase decrease in annual net pension expense 7 increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 144 additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
a 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 7m and would decrease increase the amount of the net pension obligations by 85m.

in addition, goodwill arises on therecognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.

final fair values will be incorporated in the 2012 combined financial statements.
there were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2010. the businesses acquired in 2011 contributed 34m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 8m, increased adjusted profit attributable by 8m, decreased profit attributable by 10m, and contributed 7m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been 6,065m, 1,643m, 1,071m and 771m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.

a cGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
Goodwill impairment testing is performed on the basis of 24 cGUs.
cGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
typically, when an acquisition is made the acquired business is fully integrated into the relevant business unit and cGU, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the cGUs, or groups of cGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

18 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments and capital management are set out on pages 46 and 47 of the Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

At 31 December 2011, Reed Elsevier had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in June 2014, which was undrawn.
The bank facility, together with certain of Reed Elseviers private placements, are subject to financial covenants.
Reed Elsevier was in compliance with these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2011.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2011, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature within two years 2010: nil, 44% of borrowings mature in the third year 2010: 23%, 18% in the fourth and fifth years 2010: 27%, 27% in the sixth to tenth years 2010: 39%, and 11% beyond the tenth year 2010: 11%.
Market risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2011, 69% of gross borrowings were either fixed rate or had been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 5m 2010: 3m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2011.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 5m 2010: 3m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2011 is restricted to the change in carrying value of floating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 3m 2010: 8m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 4m 2010: 9m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
indd 112 08 03 2012 08:13 Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2011 113 18 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 24.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2011 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 472m 2010: 457m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 270m 2010: 270m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2011 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 590m 2010: 570m and increase net borrowings by 330m 2010: 329m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 54m 2010: 51m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 65m 2010: 62m.
Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A A2 by Standard & Poors, moodys or Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law firms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
Included within trade receivables are the following amounts which are past due but for which no allowance has been made.
Past due up to one month 212m 2010: 241m : past due two to three months 54m 2010: 58m : past due four to six months 20m 2010: 16m : and past due greater than six months 5m 2010: 5m.
Examples of trade receivables which are past due but for which no allowance has been made include those receivables where there is no concern over the creditworthiness of the customer and where the history of dealings with the customer indicate the amount will be settled.
hedge accounting The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS39 Financial Instruments are described below: Fair value hedges Reed Elsevier has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate and foreign currency movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 1,081m 2010: 1,093m were in place at 31 December 2011 swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in sterling, euros and Swiss francs ChF to floating rate sterling, euro and US dollar USD debt respectively for the whole of their term.

8m 2010: 10m of these fair value adjustments were amortised in the year as a reduction to finance costs.
Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 Interest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
