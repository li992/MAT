Net pension surplus deficit Dened contribution scheme A dened contribution scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
Pension costs for dened contribution schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 Group m m Dened contribution schemes 2.0 2.2 Land Securities Annual Report 2011 127 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 continued 30.
Net pension surplus deficit continued Dened benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a wholly-funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a selfadministered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected-unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected-unit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2009 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
As a result of this valuation, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that, in order to address the deficit at that time, the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary will be paid together with additional employer contributions of 4m per annum for a period of six years commencing on 1 July 2010.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2011 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benets.
All death-in-service and benets for incapacity arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benets other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation were in nominal terms : 2011 2010 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.70 3.80 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.70 3.80 Discount rate 5.70 5.60 Ination Retail Price Index 3.70 3.80 Consumer Price Index 3.20 n a Expected return on plan assets 6.02 6.10 The expected return on plan assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long-dated bonds at that date.
The estimated expected return on equities includes an additional equity-risk premium.
In the year, the Group has changed the basis on which ination is estimated from the Retail Price Index RPI to the Consumer Price Index CPI for part of the schemes liability.
This has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and has therefore been applied prospectively from 1 April 2010.
The effect of the change was to decrease the present value of the dened benefit obligation by 2.1m.
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2011 2010 Group Years Years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 29.9 29.7 Women 31.5 31.4 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 32.9 32.8 Women 34.7 34.5 The fair value of the assets in the scheme including annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment and the expected rate of return net of investment management expenses were: 2011 2010 2011 2010 Group % % m m Equities 7.50 7.50 64.0 62.4 Bonds and insurance contracts 4.93 5.05 86.3 78.4 Other 0.50 0.50 0.3 0.8 Fair value of scheme assets 150.6 141.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 141.9 148.1 Net pension asset liability 8.7 6.5 The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2011 2010 Group % % Equities 43 44 Bonds and insurance contracts 57 56 128 Land Securities Annual Report 2011 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 continued 30.
Net pension surplus deficit continued The plan assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by Land Securities Group PLC.
Indirectly owned financial instruments had a fair value of less than 0.1m 2010: 0.1m.
2011 2010 Group m m Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 1.3 1.0 Charge to operating profit 1.3 1.0 Analysis of amount credited charged to interest expense Expected return on plan assets 8.6 6.6 Interest on scheme liabilities 8.2 7.2 Net return expense 0.4 0.6 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on Scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2% or 3.0m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 2.5% or 3.7m As the above table demonstrates, changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the Scheme liabilities.
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates differ from those described by IAS 19, Employee Benets.
Using these assumptions would result in a balance sheet deficit for the Scheme of 12.5m at 31 March 2011 as opposed to a surplus of 8.7m.
