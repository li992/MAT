Impairment In assessing whether a write-down is required in the carrying value of a potentially impaired intangible asset, item of property, plant and equipment or an equity-accounted investment, the assets carrying value is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Unless indicated otherwise, the recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment losses described below is value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash ow model.
The future cash ows are adjusted for risks specic to the asset and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specic risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located, although other rates may be used if appropriate to the specic circumstances.
The rate applied in each country is reassessed each year.
In certain circumstances an impairment assessment may be carried out using fair value less costs to sell as the recoverable amount when, for example, a recent market transaction for a similar asset has taken place.
For impairments of available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted investments, the fair value is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business at the balance sheet date.
Any cumulative loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.

Disposals and impairment continued Exploration and Production During 2011, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $1,443 million.
The main elements were a $555-million impairment loss relating to a number of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico, caused by an increase in the decommissioning provision as a result of further assessments of the regulations relating to idle infrastructure and a decrease in our assumption of the discount rate for provisions: the $393-million write-down of our interest in the Fayetteville shale gas asset in the US, triggered by a decrease in value by reference to a sale transaction by a partner of its interest in the same asset: and the $153-million write-down of our interest in the proposed Denali gas pipeline in Alaska, resulting from a decision not to proceed with the project.
There were several other impairment losses amounting to $342 million in total that were not individually significant.
These impairment losses were partly offset by reversals of impairment of certain of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt amounting to $146 million in total, triggered by an increase in our assumption of long-term oil prices.
During 2010, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $1,259 million.
The main elements were the $501-million write-down of assets in the Gulf of Mexico, triggered by an increase in the decommissioning provision as a result of new regulations in the US relating to idle infrastructure: impairments of oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore North America of $310 million and $80 million respectively, as a result of decisions to dispose of assets at a price lower than the assets carrying values: a $341-million write-down of accumulated costs in Sakhalin, Russia, triggered by a change in the outlook on the future recoverability of the investment: and several other individually insignicant impairment losses amounting to $27 million in total.
During 2009, the Exploration and Production segment recognized impairment losses of $118 million.
The main elements were the write-down of our $42-million investment in the East Shmidt interest in Russia, triggered by a decision to not proceed to development: a $62-million charge associated with our nErgize gas scheduling system: and several other individually insignicant impairment losses amounting to $14 million.
Rening and Marketing During 2011, the Rening and Marketing segment recognized impairment losses of $599 million.
Impairment losses of $398 million related to assets classied as held for sale.

During 2010, the Rening and Marketing segment recognized impairment losses amounting to $144 million relating to retail churn in Europe and other minor asset disposals.
These losses were largely offset by the reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss of $141 million relating to the investment in our jointly controlled entity China American Petrochemical Company resulting from a change in market conditions.
During 2009, an impairment loss of $1,579 million was recognized against the goodwill allocated to the US West Coast fuels value chain FVC.
The goodwill was originally recognized at the time of the ARCO acquisition in 2000.
The prevailing weak rening environment, together with a review of future margin expectations in the FVC, led to a reduction in the expected future cash ows.
Other impairment losses were also recognized by the segment on a number of assets which amounted to $255 million.
Other businesses and corporate During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Other businesses and corporate recognized impairment losses totalling $58 million, $113 million and $189 million respectively related to various assets in the Alternative Energy business.
