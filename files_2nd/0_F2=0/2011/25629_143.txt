Provision is made for the future rental cost of vacant property.
In calculating the provision required, account is taken of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable from subletting.
Property provisions occur principally in the USA and UK and relate to a variety of lease commitments.
The longest lease terms for each country are to 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Litigation provisions At any point in time the Group can be involved in a variety of litigation issues.
A balance sheet provision is established in respect of such issues when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Group analyses its litigation exposures based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
Where appropriate the Group also provides for the cost of defending or initiating such matters.
