Petrofac 144 Annual report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 34 Risk management and financial instruments Risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise available-for-sale financial assets, trade and other receivables, amounts due from to related parties, cash and short-term deposits, work-in-progress, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables and deferred consideration.
The Groups activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with interest rate risk on its variable rate cash and shortterm deposits, loans and borrowings and foreign currency risk on both conducting business in currencies other than reporting currency as well as translation of the assets and liabilities of foreign operations to the reporting currency.
These risks are managed from time to time by using a combination of various derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps and forward currency contracts in line with the Groups hedging policies.
The Group has a policy not to enter into speculative trading of financial derivatives.
The Board of Directors of the Company has established an Audit Committee and Risk Committee to help identify, evaluate and manage the significant financial risks faced by the Group and their activities are discussed in detail on pages 82 to 90.
The other main risks besides interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk and the policies relating to these risks are discussed in detail below: Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the Groups interest-bearing financial liabilities and assets.
The Groups exposure to market risk arising from changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term variable rate debt obligations and its cash and bank balances.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups cash and bank balances are at floating rates of interest.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The impact on the Groups pre-tax profit and equity due to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on loans and borrowings at the reporting date is demonstrated in the table below.
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges At 31 December 2011, the Group held no derivative instruments, designated as cash flow hedges in relation to floating rate interestbearing loans and borrowings 2010: nil.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, and translation of assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency of its operating units.
The Group is also exposed to the translation of the functional currencies of its units to the US dollar reporting currency of the Group.
The following table summarises the percentage of foreign currency denominated revenues, costs, financial assets and financial liabilities, expressed in US dollar terms, of the Group totals.
2011 2010 % of foreign % of foreign currency currency denominated denominated items items Revenues 36.4% 41.6% Costs 57.7% 62.2% Current financial assets 32.5% 34.8% Non-current financial assets 0.0% 0.0% Current financial liabilities 34.7% 51.2% Non-current financial liabilities 54.2% 59.4% The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations.
It is the Groups policy not to enter into forward contracts until a highly probable forecast transaction is in place and to negotiate the terms of the derivative instruments used for hedging to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The income statements of foreign operations are translated into the reporting currency using a weighted average exchange rate of conversion.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate at the reporting date.
Revenues and costs in currencies other than the functional currency of an operating unit are recorded at the prevailing rate at the date of the transaction.

At 31 December 2011, the Group had cash and short-term deposits designated as cash flow hedges with a fair value loss of US$9,440,000 2010: US$1,633,000 loss as follows: Fair value Net unrealised gain loss 2011 2010 2011 2010 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Euro cash and short-term deposits 180,520 15,730 9,206 1,798 Sterling cash and short-term deposits 15,098 2,086 377 120 Yen cash and short-term deposits 3,251 4,510 145 278 Swiss francs cash and short-term deposits 660 7 9,440 1,633 During 2011, changes in fair value losses of US$14,117,000 2010: losses US$19,456,000 relating to these derivative instruments and financial assets were taken to equity and US$3,979,000 of gains 2010: US$16,764,000 gains were recycled from equity into cost of sales in the income statement.
The forward points and ineffective portions of the above foreign exchange forward contracts and loss on un-designated derivatives of US$5,881,000 2010: US$3,409,000 loss were recognised in the income statement note 4b.
Commodity price risk oil prices The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in oil & gas prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil & gas.
The Groups policy is to manage its exposure to the impact of changes in oil & gas prices using derivative instruments, primarily swaps and collars.
Hedging is only undertaken once sufficiently reliable and regular long-term forecast production data is available.
During the year the Group entered into various crude oil swaps and zero cost collars hedging oil production of 163,766 barrels bbl 2010: 176,400 bbl with maturities ranging from January 2012 to December 2012.
In addition, fuel oil swaps were also entered into for hedging gas production of 21,100 metric tons MT 2010: 43,750MT with maturities from January 2012 to September 2012.
The fair value of oil derivatives at 31 December 2011 was US$636,000 liability 2010: US$1,163,000 liability with net unrealised losses deferred in equity of US$332,000.
During the year, losses of US$304,000 2010: US$152,000 loss were recycled from equity into the consolidated income statement on the occurrence of the hedged transactions and a gain in the fair value recognised in equity of US$527,000 2010: US$1,163,000 loss.
The following table summarises the impact on the Groups pre-tax profit and equity due to a change in the fair value of oil derivative instruments and the underlifting asset overlifting liability of a reasonably possible change in the oil price: Pre-tax profit Equity 10 US$ bbl 10 US$ bbl 10 US$ bbl 10 US$ bbl increase decrease increase decrease US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 31 December 2011 1,050 1,050 1,716 1,716 31 December 2010 194 194 802 802 Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Business Unit Risk Review Committees BURRC have been set up by the Board of Directors to evaluate the creditworthiness of each individual third-party at the time of entering into new contracts.
Limits have been placed on the approval authority of the BURRC above which the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company is required.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups five largest customers accounted for 47.1% of outstanding trade receivables and work in progress 2010: 72.0%.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-forsale financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a healthy capital base to sustain future growth and maximise shareholder value.
The Group seeks to optimise shareholder returns by maintaining a balance between debt and capital and monitors the efficiency of its capital structure on a regular basis.
The gearing ratio and return on shareholders equity is as follows: 2011 2010 US$000 US$000 Cash and short-term deposits 1,572,338 1,063,005 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings A 77,161 87,661 Net cash B 1,495,177 975,344 Equity attributable to Petrofac Limited shareholders C 1,110,736 776,462 Profit for the year attributable to Petrofac Limited shareholders D 539,425 557,817 Gross gearing ratio A C 6.9% 11.3% Net gearing ratio B C Net cash Net cash position position Shareholders return on investment D C 48.6% 71.8% Overview ReRi view of f operat tiions Financial Fina Financia nciall performance and risk Corpora Corp Corpora orat t te e e responsibility Go G G vernance Gr Gr Gro o ou up p p financial statements Comp Com Compa pa an n ny y y financial statements Petrofac 148 Annual report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 34 Risk management and financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of the Groups financial instruments and their carrying amounts included within the Groups statement of financial position are set out below: Carrying amount Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 1,572,338 1,063,005 1,572,338 1,063,005 Restricted cash 2,813 19,462 2,813 19,462 Available-for-sale financial assets 101,494 101,494 Seven Energy warrants 17,616 11,969 17,616 11,969 Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 8,376 7,961 8,376 7,961 Forward currency contracts undesignated 177 1,234 177 1,234 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 77,161 87,661 80,277 91,820 Deferred consideration 16,268 35,874 16,268 35,874 Oil derivative 636 1,163 636 1,163 Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 21,212 8,173 21,212 8,173 Forward currency contracts undesignated 618 3,035 618 3,035 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available-for-sale financial assets, forward currency contracts and oil derivatives.
The fair value of warrants over equity instruments in Seven Energy has been calculated using a Black Scholes option valuation model note 14.
The fair values of long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings are equivalent to their amortised costs determined as the present value of discounted future cash flows using the effective interest rate.
The Company considers that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, work-in-progress, trade and other payables, other current and non-current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values and are therefore excluded from the above table.
Fair value hierarchy The following financial instruments are measured at fair value using the hierarchy below for determination and disclosure of their respective fair values: Tier 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities Tier 2: Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on all observation data directly or indirectly Tier 3: Other valuation techniques where the inputs are based on unobservable market data Independent auditors report Petrofac Consolidated income statement Annual report and accounts 2011 149 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Consolidated statement of financial position Consolidated statement of cash ows Consolidated statement of changes in equity Notes to the consolidated financial statements 01 22 41 50 65 15 1 3 Assets measured at fair value Year ended 31 December 2011 Tier 1 Tier 2 2011 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial assets Seven Energy warrants 17,616 17,616 Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 8,376 8,376 Forward currency contracts undesignated 177 177 Financial liabilities Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 21,212 21,212 Forward currency contracts undesignated 618 618 Oil derivative 636 636 Year ended 31 December 2010 Tier 1 Tier 2 2010 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets 243 101,251 101,494 Seven Energy warrants 11,969 11,969 Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 7,961 7,961 Forward currency contracts undesignated 1,234 1,234 Financial liabilities Forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedge 8,173 8,173 Forward currency contracts undesignated 3,035 3,035 Oil derivative 1,163 1,163 Overview ReRi view of f operat tiions Financial Fina Financia nciall performance and risk Corpora Corp Corpora orat t te e e responsibility Go G G vernance Gr Gr Gro o ou up p p financial statements Comp Com Compa pa an n ny y y financial statements
