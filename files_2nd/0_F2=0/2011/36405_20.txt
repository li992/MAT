62 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of properties, financial instruments and pension assets.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors report on page 90.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the financial statements.
The directors believe that the judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Critical accounting judgements include the adoption of the external portfolio valuation, the adoption of a single reporting segment and the level of control the Group has in respect of its joint ventures.
The accounting policies for these areas of judgement are set out below.
During 2011, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group, the pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only: Amendments to IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues: Amendments to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions: IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations: and Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax of Underlying Assets: Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IAS 24 revised Related Party Disclosures: Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: and IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group directs the financial and operating policies of an entity to benefit from its activities.
Rent receivable This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Tenant leases The directors have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives Lease incentives including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or on another systematic basis, if applicable.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specific properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
63 Annual review Financials Governance Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market based criteria will not be met.
Investment property Investment properties are professionally valued each year, on a market value basis, and any surpluses or deficits arising are taken to the income statement.
Disposals of properties are recognised where contracts have been unconditionally exchanged during the accounting period and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred to the purchaser.
Investment property under development Investment properties under development are professionally valued each year on a market value basis and any surpluses or deficits arising are taken to the income statement.
All directly attributable costs of bringing a property to a condition suitable for letting, including costs incurred prior to gaining planning permission, are capitalised into the cost of the property.
Once development is concluded, the property is transferred to investment property.
Depreciation No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings over three to five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the Group has joint control of the entity.
The Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Balances with partners owed to or from the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint venture profits and losses are included in the Group income statement in a single line.
All of the Groups joint ventures adopt the accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the Group financial statements.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Pension benefits The Group contributes to a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to reserves: all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site if it has been purchased with the specific intention to redevelop, but does not include the original book cost of a site previously held as an investment property.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specific associated borrowings.
Financial instruments: i Derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate risks.
The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative is a designated hedge and provides an effective cash flow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative is a designated hedge or does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
ii Borrowings The Groups borrowings in the form of its debentures and bank loans are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount or premium on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently borrowings are held at amortised cost, with any discounts, premiums and attributable costs charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
64 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Segmental analysis All of the Groups revenue is generated from investment properties located in central London.
The properties are managed as a single portfolio by an asset management team whose responsibilities are not segregated by location or type, but are managed on an asset by asset basis.
The majority of the Groups assets are mixed use, therefore the office and retail space is managed together.
Within the investment property portfolio the Group has a number of properties under development.
The directors view the Groups development activities as an integral part of the life cycle of each of its assets rather than a separate business or division.
The nature of developing property means that whilst a property is under development it generates no revenue and has no operating results.
Once a development has completed it returns to the investment property portfolio.
The directors have considered the nature of the business, how the business is managed and how they review performance and, in their judgement, the Group has only one reportable segment.
The components of the valuation, as provided by CBRE, are set out on page 30 of this report.
Development management agreements Where the outcome of a development management agreement can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
Management exercise judgement when estimating the percentage complete.
This is normally measured as the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Variations in work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the client.
Where the outcome of a development management agreement cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

On the termination of these derivatives, fair value movements previously charged to reserves are required to be recycled through the income statement where the facilities to which they relate are not expected to be utilised.
During the year, the Group recycled 3.1 million of losses from the hedging reserve to the income statement.
The remaining hedging reserve of 1.5 million relates to facilities which are expected to be utilised and will be amortised to the income statement over the outstanding term of the derivatives had they not been terminated.

A deferred tax asset of 8.4 million, mainly relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2011 and deferred tax arising in respect of the fair value of derivatives, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which these losses can be offset.
The Group converted to a REIT on 1 January 2007 and as such is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
67 Annual review Financials Governance 8 Tax continued The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

Eurohypo has a profit share arrangement dependent on the success of the two development schemes held by GPE Marcol House Limited.
Eurphypo is able to exert influence over the development strategy for the buildings and because these are the only assets held by the entity this influence extends over the whole of the entitys operations.
As a result of this arrangement GPE and Eurohypo are considered to have joint control over the business of the entity although GPE has a 100% equity interest.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 31 GPE Marcol House Limited has been treated as a joint venture.

The bonds were priced on 31 March 2011 with the respective coupons set as follows: 30 million, seven-year bond at 5.09%: $130 million, seven-year bond at 4.81%: and $78 million, ten-year bond at 5.37%.
The related legal documentation was signed on 27 April 2011 and the funds will be drawn on 30 June 2011.
As the Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and all of its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, it entered into a cross currency swap in order to ensure the US dollar liability stream generated by the bond was fully hedged into sterling for the life of the transaction.
Through entering into the cross currency swap the Group has created a synthetic sterling fixed rate liability exposure for seven and ten years totalling 159.7 million.

The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 13 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversified range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, as a result the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions is fully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
75 Annual review Financials Governance 16 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversified across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facilities.
The availability of these facilities depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with these covenants are set out in the table below: March 2011 Key covenants Covenant Actuals Group 0.32x Net debt net equity 1.25x Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x 3.46x Interest cover 1.35x 4.03x The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 340 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result the directors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date.

It is the risk that future cash flows from a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy either to eliminate interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long-term debt finance through the use of fixed rate debentures or to mitigate the risk through the use of floating to fixed interest rate swaps, caps, collars and swaptions.
It is the Groups policy to maintain the proportion of floating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total interest rate cost.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its floating rate interest payments on its bank debt for fixed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a fixed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate caps Interest rate caps protect the Group from rises in short-term interest rates by making a payment to the Group when the underlying interest rate exceeds a specified rate the cap rate on a notional value.
If the underlying rate exceeds the cap rate, the payment is based upon the difference between the two rates, ensuring the Group only pays the maximum of the cap rate.
Interest rate floors Under the terms of an interest rate floor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has agreed to issue debt with a fixed interest rate in June 2011.
The Group has bought an interest rate floor, which, when combined with this fixed rate debt, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect of floating rate debt.
Interest rate swaptions An interest rate swaption provides the Group with an option to enter into an interest rate swap on a specified future exercise date at a set price.
On the exercise date the Group can either enter into the interest rate swap or let the option lapse.
Such contracts act as an insurance policy against future interest rate rises.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from fluctuating exchange rates between sterling and other currencies.

23 Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined benefit pension plan the Plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Group.
The Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2002.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan was conducted at 1 April 2009 by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The Plan was valued using the following main assumptions: 2011 2010 % % Discount rate 5.50 5.75 Expected return on Plan assets 5.45 5.47 Expected rate of salary increases 4.50 4.75 Future pension increases 3.50 3.75 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on the Plan assets, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term rate of return on Plan assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of an assumption of 5.45% p. a.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Plan is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Present value of unfunded obligations 18.7 17.5 Fair value of the Plan assets 18.4 17.3 Pension liability 0.3 0.2 80 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements 23 Employee benefits continued Amounts recognised as administration expenses in the income statement are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Current service cost 0.2 0.2 Interest on obligation 1.0 0.9 Expected return on the Plan assets 0.9 0.8 0.3 0.3 Actuarial deficit recognised immediately in the Group statement of changes in equity 0.2 1.0 Cumulative actuarial gains recognised in the Group statement of changes in equity 1.2 1.4 Changes in the present value of the pension obligation are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Defined benefit obligation at 1 April 17.5 13.4 Service cost 0.2 0.2 Interest cost 1.0 0.9 Actuarial gain 0.5 3.6 Benefits paid 0.5 0.6 Defined benefit obligation at 31 March 18.7 17.5 Changes to the fair value of the Plan assets are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Fair value of the Plan assets at 1 April 17.3 14.1 Expected return on the Plan assets 0.9 0.8 Actuarial gain 0.3 2.6 Contributions 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid 0.5 0.6 Fair value of the Plan assets at 31 March 18.4 17.3 Net liability 0.3 0.2 The fair value of the Plan assets at the balance sheet date is analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m Equities 7.4 6.9 Bonds 11.0 10.4 18.4 17.3 The actual return on Plan assets was a surplus of 1.2 million 2010: surplus of 3.4 million.
