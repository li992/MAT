Financial Assets and Liabilities The Groups financial instruments are analysed into category as follows: 2011 2010 Financing Carrying Income Carrying Income amount expense amount expense 000 000 000 000 Current Asset Investments 246 16 256 16 Current Assets at Fair Value 246 16 256 16 Derivative Financial Instruments 3,982 556 4,538 1,981 Fixed Rate Loans and Borrowings 161,169 7,010 155,012 1,414 Current and Non-current Liabilities at Fair Value 165,151 6,454 159,550 567 Trade and Other Receivables 41,221 312 40,274 373 Cash and Cash Equivalents 75,296 200 28,268 198 Current Assets at Amortised Cost 116,517 512 68,542 571 Trade and Other Payables 36,839 23 33,603 22 Floating Rate Loans and Borrowings 88,656 2,328 49,241 3,990 Current and Non-current Liabilities at Amortised Cost 125,495 2,351 82,844 4,012 Total Financial Instruments 173,883 8,309 173,596 2,858 In common with all businesses, the Group is exposed to the following types of risk which arise from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk This note presents information about the nature of the Groups exposure to such risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, have delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.

Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential significant defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Collateral is generally required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees or bank guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review, particularly in the current economic conditions.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently significantly out-of-themoney: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2011, gearing was 18.6 per cent.
as restated on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
In April 2011, 41.0 million of bank loans, which had only been drawn down for a short period, were repaid: excluding this repayment, 14.2 million of loans and borrowing were repayable within one year.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2011, excluding the cash being held for the loan repayment of 41.0 million and tenants deposits, were 30.6 million 2010 24.6 million.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 30.6 million 2010 41.6 million or 71.6 million after the loan repayment in April 2011.
Of this, 61.6 million expires in 2015 and 10.0 million in 2018.

Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 16.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.2 million, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the Income Statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps of 7.7 million.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate excluding margin Notional principal Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Per cent.
000 000 000 000 Maturing in less than one year 7.8 26,611 318 Maturing in more than five years 5.6 5.6 25,000 25,000 3,982 4,220 25,000 51,611 3,982 4,538 Foreign exchange rates The Group seeks to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk in relation to its USA net assets by funding its USA investment property with US Dollar denominated loans and borrowings.
