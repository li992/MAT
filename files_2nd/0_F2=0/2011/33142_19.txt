Notes to the Consolidated and Parent Financial Statements for the year ended June 30, 2011 Kofax plc the Group is a publicly listed company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is 1 Cedarwood, Chineham Business Park, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG24 8WD, United Kingdom.
The Groups ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
AUTHORIZATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Financial Statements of Kofax plc and its subsidiaries the Group for the year ended June 30, 2011 were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on October 3, 2011 and the Statements of Financial Position were signed on behalf of the Board by Greg Lock and Jamie Arnold.
NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
1.1 Basis of preparation These Consolidated and Parent only Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRICs and the Companies Act 2006.
The results for the year ended June 30, 2011 include those for the Parent and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
Under the exemption given in the Companies Act 2006 Section 408, the Parent Company does not present its own Income Statement.
The Parents functional currency is pound sterling as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Parent operates.
The Groups presentational currency is U. S. dollars as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
All values are rounded to $000 except where otherwise stated.
Certain amounts do not correspond to the 2010 financial statements due to reclassifications resulting from discontinued operations.
1.2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee, so as to obtain benefits from its activities, and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company and are based on consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from them, are eliminated.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3R.
On acquisition date, businesses are recorded at acquisition cost, being the fair value at the date of exchange of the cash paid, or other consideration given.
Deferred considerations would be recognized and reflected in the PPA on a discounted basis if the time value of money is considered to be material.
Direct transaction costs would be directly expensed through the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired businesses are identified as required by IFRS 3R, and are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at their acquisition date fair values, with certain exceptions as set out in IFRS 3R.
If the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, the excess is recognized as goodwill.
In the event that the value of the net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition, the excess is immediately recognized as a gain in the Consolidated Income Statement at the acquisition date.
Foreign currency When determining the functional currency of a foreign entity the Group takes into consideration the economical environment, the currency influencing operational transactions as well as financial transactions and the activity of the entity.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
The gains or losses on translation are included in the Consolidated Income Statement with the exception on consolidation where differences on foreign currency borrowings from foreign currency subsidiaries which form part of the net investment are taken directly to equity until the date of disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Foreign currency differences arising on trading intercompany loans are charged to operating expenses.
44 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into U. S. Dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, where this represents a reasonable approximation of actual exchange rates at the date of transactions.
The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The net assets of the Parent and Group are translated into U. S. Dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
While all equity components i. e. share capital, share premium account, ESOP shares, treasury shares, merger reserve and retained earnings are translated at historical rates, the remainder, resulting from the retranslation of the net assets at spot rate is reflected in the currency translation adjustment.
Revenue recognition The Group derives its revenue principally from the sale of software licenses, software maintenance, and fees derived from installation, consultancy, and training services and from the sale of hardware products and related services, which are now discontinued operations.
Revenue represents the total amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services provided to third parties, excluding VAT and similar taxes.
Revenue for software licenses and hardware products are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, when delivery occurs, at a fixed and determinable price, and when collectability is probable.
Delivery is defined based on the terms of the evidence of arrangement, which is generally the customers purchase order or the sale contract.
The Group has master agreements in place with most of its software resellers.
These master agreements outline in detail the terms and conditions for each sales transaction.
It is common practice in the software and hardware industries to hold a master agreement with a reseller setting out the general legal features between the parties.
The resellers sell maintenance contracts supporting the software licenses and hardware products sold, where the support and maintenance is provided by the Group.
The maintenance revenue, which is sold with the license or hardware product is recognized in the income statement pro rata over the maintenance period, with the unrecognized element presented in deferred income on the balance sheet.
Revenue in multiple-elements contracts with resellers or end users is allocated to each deliverable based on the Groups established fair values of each component.
All contracts are structured in a way that clearly identifies separable elements in the contract, e. g. the license, post-contract customer support, and professional services.
The Group has policies and methodologies in place to validate that the fair value reflects cost plus a reasonable margin.
Service revenue from installation, consultancy and training is recognized over the period in which the service is provided.
Cash rebates and sale price discounts granted to customers are classified as a reduction of revenue.
Subsidiary undertakings The investment in subsidiary undertakings of the Parent only is stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
The cost is comprised of any cash consideration and the fair value of shares issued as considerations.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill is recognized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment annually near each reporting date or whenever indicators of impairment exist.
Any impairment is immediately recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit CGU, defined and monitored by the management, as set out in Note 15.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill and is then allocated pro rata to the other assets of the CGU.
b Intangible assets arising from business combinations The fair values of intangible assets purchased as part of business combinations are determined by a valuation model which is generally prepared independently.
These intangible assets, such as contractual relationships and technology, are amortized over their expected useful lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying amounts are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable.
Amortization of these intangibles is included in a separate line below Notes to the Financial Statements 45 NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued operating expenses.
The principal expected useful lives are: Contractual and customer relationships 5 - 7 years Technology 5 - 7 years c Licenses and similar rights Purchased computer software licenses and similar rights are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred.
Where internal costs are directly associated with software projects in combination with purchased licenses such cost are deemed to be eligible for capitalisation.
These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives 3-5 years on a straight line basis and are recorded to the respective operating expense or cost of sales line.
d Research and development Costs associated with developing or maintaining software are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Where costs are directly associated with the development of identifiable software products controlled by the Group, and it is both probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to these costs will flow to the Group, and that the costs can be measured reliably, these costs are recognized as an intangible asset.
Direct costs include directly attributable employee expenses and overhead expenses.
The Board has carefully considered the stage of current product development and is currently of the opinion that no expenditure incurred qualifies for capitalisation under IFRS.
Impairment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is determined.
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognized in the Income Statement.
No impairment is reversed for goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost.
The costs include the purchase price and directly attributable costs to bring the asset into a useable condition.
Depreciation on all items of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives or the shorter lease term.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Buildings 3% Leasehold improvements 10-20% Machines and equipment 20-50% Motor vehicles 20% Furniture and fixtures 20% The carrying amounts are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable.
Inventories Finished goods and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The Group is applying the first in, first out FIFO cost formula.
Investment in associates Those undertakings, not being subsidiary undertakings, over which the Group has significant influence are treated as associates and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 46 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
The Group includes its share of associates profits or losses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is included in the carrying amount of the associate.
For associates with coterminous year ends, the financial statements are used in applying the equity method of accounting.
For associates with non coterminous year ends, the associates management accounts are used.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are included in this category and recognized on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the trade date.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.
Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial assets may be designated at initial recognition as being fair value with changes reported through profit and loss if the following criteria are met: i the designation eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or recognizing gains or losses on them on a different basis: ii the assets are part of a group of financial assets, which are managed, and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management strategy: or iii the financial asset contains an embedded derivative that would need to be separately recorded.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement when the loans and receivables are fide-recognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
Loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are non-derivative financial liabilities carried initially at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
Gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the amortization process.
Borrowing costs are recognized as an expense when incurred.
Derivative financial liabilities are recognized as financial liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss.
Classes of financial instruments a Cash and cash-equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, bank overdrafts as discussed in d below are treated as cash and cash equivalents.
b Investments Current investments consist of money market deposits and other short term deposits.
Any interest income or expense is recorded and accrued over the period of the investment.
c Borrowings Borrowings are classified as current financial liabilities unless the Group has the right to defer settlement of the liabilities for more than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
d Bank overdrafts Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current financial liabilities.
Bank overdrafts form part of cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the Consolidated and Parent Cash Flow Statements.
e Derivative financial instruments Sales and purchases which occur in currencies other than the local currency are hedged when such transactions are significant.
This is carried out primarily by entering into short-term and long-term forward exchange contracts to match future cash flows.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
f Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are not interest bearing.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as Notes to the Financial Statements 47 NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
g Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are not interest bearing.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities a Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognized when: i The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: ii The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement: or iii The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
b Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Taxes a Current tax The charge for current taxation is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement as it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted for the relevant entity at the Balance Sheet date.
b Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the following exceptions: i Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit loss: ii In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary and associate undertakings where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits, or tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply within the relevant tax jurisdiction when the related asset is realized or liability settled based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legal right of enforcement exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the group to make a single net payment.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group are classified as finance leases.
The amount initially recognized as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments over the term of the lease.
The corresponding commitment is shown as a liability.
Lease payments are analysed between capital payments and interest payments.
Interest is recognized at a constant rate based on the carrying amount.
The asset is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term.
Retirement benefit costs The Group makes payments to defined contribution pension schemes and to defined benefit pension schemes.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they become payable.
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured using market values and pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method.
The pension scheme deficit is recognized in full.
The movement in the scheme deficit is split 48 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued between operating charges and finance costs recognized in the Income Statement, and actuarial gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Employee share plans The Group operates an Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and an Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
The cost of the Groups shares held by the ESOP and EBT are deducted from shareholders funds in the Group Balance Sheet.
Other assets and liabilities of the ESOP and EBT are recognized as assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the ESOP and EBT are treated as cancelled for the purpose of calculating earnings per share.
Any financing and administrative costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The ESOP is considered an extension of one of the Swiss subsidiaries and is therefore treated as a subsidiary in the Parent Company Financial Statements.
The EBT, however is considered to be an extension of the Parent Company and is therefore directly included as part of the Parent only Financial Statements.
Treasury shares Kofax plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognized at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to equity.
No gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Share based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share base compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options or shares is recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are not taken into account for determining the fair values but are taken into account in assessing the number of options or shares expected to ultimately vest.
The fair value, determined at the date of grant, is calculated utilising an appropriate valuation model as set out in Note 31.
The share based payment expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest allowing for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The Parent applies the same policy in respect of share based payment with the exception that the fair value charge associated with employees of subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase to investments with the corresponding credit being taken to equity.
Dividend distribution Final dividends distributed to the Groups shareholders are recognized in the Group Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Interim dividends are accrued as payable when appropriately authorized and no longer at the discretion of the entity.
This is usually when they are paid.
Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Consolidated Income Statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the specific risks to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
Restructuring Provisions A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Provisions for severance payments and related employment costs are made in full when employees are identified as being the direct result of the restructuring plan.
Costs relating to ongoing activities, such as relocation, training and information systems are recognized only when incurred.
Provisions for onerous leases are recorded when they are part of an announced restructuring and the leased space becomes no longer in use.
The expected remaining lease payments are expensed at the time the provision is recorded.
NOTE 2 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTINGS POLICIES 2.1 Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in the current year The accounting policies adopted in these Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those of the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2010 except for the adoption of the following new standards, amendments to the standards and interpretations which are mandatory for the financial year ending June 30, 2011: Notes to the Financial Statements 49 NOTE 2 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTINGS POLICIES continued Effective date IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Additional exemptions for First-time January 1, 2010 Adopters amended The amendment provides relief to entities with oil and gas assets and leases that are first-time adopters, by reducing the cost of transition to IFRS.

This amendment had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments July 1, 2010 The modifications of financial liabilities will result in a gain recognized in profit or loss as the fair value of the equity issued will often be less than the carrying value of the liability.

Additional disclosures will be required to explain the valuation techniques, inputs used, and effects of fair value measurements on profit and loss.
2011 Improvements to IFRS January 1, 2011 It amends 6 existing standards, basis of conclusions, and guidance.
Notes to the Financial Statements 51 NOTE 3 PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENTS NOTE 3 PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENTS Maintenance Revenue In the prior years, the Groups amortization of deferred maintenance revenue did not accurately reflect the terms of the maintenance contract.
The Group used a half-month convention to amortize deferred maintenance revenue rather than a daily rate amortization, which created the error outlined below.
This error resulted in a restatement of prior years maintenance revenues in the income statement and corresponding restatement of deferred maintenance revenue in the balance sheet for financial years 2009 and 2010 in the amounts as follows: $000 As previously reported Adjustments As Restated 2009 Deferred Revenue 47,049 600 46,449 Revenue 169,391 600 169,991 Tax expense 3,748 233 3,981 2010 Deferred revenue 58,216 2,400 55,816 Revenue 215,838 1,800 217,638 Includes adjustment from 2009 and 2010 of $0.6m and $1.8m, respectively.
The 2009 opening balance sheet at July 1, 2008 includes the $0.6m as an adjustment to retained earnings.
Inventory In 2010, as a result of an inaccurate transfer of work-in-progress items to finished goods, the Group overstated inventory.
The changes to inventory and the corresponding costs of sales amounts are as follows: $000 As previously reported Adjustments As Restated Inventory 16,380 704 15,676 Cost of sales 49,929 704 50,633 The effect on 2010 tax expense of these two restatements is as follows: $000 As previously reported  Restated revenue cost of sales Tax expense 8,988 698 273 9,413 Note that tax items on the balance sheet were not impacted by these restatements.
The effect on EPS as a result of these two restatements: 2010 Earnings per share basic $0.093 $0.008 $0.101 diluted $0.090 $0.008 $0.098 adjusted basic $0.208 $0.000 $0.208 adjusted diluted $0.201 $0.002 $0.199 See also Note 6 for discussion regarding the prior year restatements associated with the purchase accounting for certain tax related items in relation to the acquisition of 170 Systems.
NOTE 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Revenue Revenue in multiple-elements contracts with resellers or end users is allocated to each deliverable based on the Groups established fair values of each component.
All contracts are structured in a way that clearly identifies separable elements in the 52 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS continued contract, i. e. the license, post-contract customer support, or professional services.
Tax The Group and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations are discussed and agreed with the appropriate authorities.
Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for both current and deferred tax on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax authority concerned.
For deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses management estimates the future expected cash flows against which these tax losses can be offset and determine the level of asset that should be recognized.
Share based payments estimate The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Judgment is required in determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant of equity instruments, depending on the terms and conditions of the grant.
Management is also required to use judgment in determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield.
Another significant area of estimation relates to the assessment of probability of achievement of the performance criteria related to Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The assumptions and models used are disclosed in Note 31.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually, by cash-generating unit, as to whether goodwill has been impaired and, more frequently, when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
Please refer to Note 15 for assumptions and parameters used.
Defined benefit pension schemes The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are based on a number of selected assumptions.
These include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the schemes assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
Restructuring provisions A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
These provisions are based on the Groups judgment and best estimate of expected future costs to be incurred associated with employee compensation and onerous leases.
NOTE 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS During the six months ended December 31, 2010, the Board of Directors made a decision to dispose of the Groups hardware business segment to better position the Group to focus on, and further grow, the software business revenues and earnings.
As of December 31, 2010, final negotiations of the sale were in progress with the buyer and the Group considered the disposal to be highly probable.
On January 15, 2011, the Group entered into a definitive Share Purchase Agreement to sell the hardware business.
On May 31, 2011, the Group completed the sale of the hardware business.
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Hannover Finanz, paid a gross consideration of $24.4m to acquire certain legal entities, the Dicom brand and name, the assets and liabilities of the hardware business, other than those that must remain with Kofax such as taxes payable, and assume the employment of personnel in the hardware business.
Of the $24.4m, $15.9m was paid at closing, $5.7m will be paid one year from closing, with $2.0m thereof subject to certain indemnification terms and conditions.
The remaining $2.8m, including interest thereon at a rate of five percent per annum, will be paid 18 months from closing.
The payments of all amounts beyond the closing date are adequately secured by Hannover Finanz for Dicom.
In addition, Kofax lent $0.5m, at closing of the transaction, to certain members of the business units management team to partially finance the cost of their minority equity purchases in the new hardware business entity.
These loans were in the form of full recourse promissory notes to be paid over a four year period, together with interest thereon at the rate of five percent per annum, or in full upon the earlier disposal of said equity.
Notes to the Financial Statements 53 NOTE 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS continued Transition Services Agreement As part of the transaction to sell the hardware business, the Group has entered into a transition services agreement to provide and transfer certain back office functions, information management systems infrastructure, and facilities to the new hardware business entity for a period of up to twelve months following the closing.
These services are provided at no cost to the buyer for the first two months following the sale, $145,000 for the next two months, and at a fair value consideration for the subsequent eight months thereafter.
The fair value of the services to be provided at an amount less than cost is estimated at $1.5m and has been reallocated from the gross consideration to deferred income.
As of June 30, 2011, one month of this liability has been released.
Impairment The Group evaluated the Hardware Business disposal as of the date it was classified as held for sale on December 31, 2010 relative to the Goodwill that was to be disposed.
Based on the facts and circumstances, including the selling price and list of specific assets and liabilities included in the most current share purchase and asset transfer agreements at the time, there were no indicators of impairment at the date it was classified as held for sale and throughout the remainder of the year.
Thus, all Hardware Business related Goodwill was disposed at the time of final sale and included in the loss on sale calculation noted above.
As a result of the conclusion that the hardware business should be presented as a discontinued operation, non-currents assets were reclassified as disposal assets held for sale, and the group incurred an impairment charge deriving from capitalized software, which is of no further use for the Group.
The results of the hardware business operations and loss on disposal for the year to date of sale, May 31, 2011 are presented below.

The net cash flows provided by the hardware business are as follows: $000 Year to Year to June 30, June 30, 2011 2010 Operating 10,905 9,585 Investing 2,213 842 Financing - - Net cash outflow inflow 13,118 10,427 EPS from the hardware business is as follows: $000 Year to Year to June 30, June 30, 2011 2010 Earnings per share from discontinued operations: Basic $0.123 $0.005 Diluted $0.111 $0.005 Basic EPS was calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue totalling 82.5m 2010: 82.0m during the period.
Diluted EPS was calculated using 87.7m 2010: 84.7m ordinary shares, the difference to the basic calculation representing the additional shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As the hardware business was sold prior to June 30, 2011, the disposal group assets and liabilities are no longer included in the statement of financial position.
Additionally, upon selling the Hardware Business subsidiary to the Buyer, the Group recycled the associated cumulative translation adjustment that was included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Other transactions In addition to the transition services agreement and loans provided to certain members of the business units management team discussed above, the Group entered into a reselling arrangement with the newly formed, separate Hardware business to facilitate sales in the Middle East and South Africa since the legal formation of the new Hardware business in these locations has not occurred.
Although such legal transfer of these specific net assets has not occurred, a change of control has occurred and, consistent with IFRS, has been included in the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations.
Accordingly, all profits and losses are considered to be realized by the new Hardware business and remitted back to them.
Notes to the Financial Statements 55 NOTE 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS continued Subsequent Events Subsequent to the date of financial position, $0.1m of the $0.5m that was lent to the members of the business units management team has been repaid to the Group.
Additionally, the legal transfer of the net assets in the Middle East and South Africa discussed above has been finalized.
NOTE 6 ACQUISITIONS On May 26, 2011 Kofax acquired 100% of the shares of Atalasoft, Inc. a US company which is a leading provider of imaging software development toolkits.
With the acquisition of this company the Group has provided its product portfolio with capabilities for its portal and internet browser based applications.
The Group has prepared the preliminary fair value adjustments to the identifiable assets and liabilities of Atalasoft, Inc. at acquisition date as set out below.

None of the trade receivables have been impaired and it is expected that the full contractual amounts can be collected.
The goodwill of $6.8m comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and the workforce, which is not separately recognized.
All of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, Atalasoft, Inc. has contributed $0.4m of revenue and breakeven net income to the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from Atalasoft, Inc. s continuing operations would have been approximately $3.9m and the contribution to net income would have been approximately $0.4m and would have made the Groups total revenue $249.3m and profit $8.7m.
Deferred payments of $4.7m represent the acquisition-date fair value of the payments that management estimates will become payable to the former shareholders of Atalasoft, Inc. however, none of the payments are guaranteed.
The actual cash value of these payments, if they were to become payable in full, is $5.1 m, and they are payable based on metrics to be measured through September 30, 2013.
Accordingly, the range of potential payments is $0 to $5.1m.

The result of these adjustments restates the net assets acquired and has direct effect on the goodwill acquired at acquisition.
These prior year restatements did not impact the comparative periods financial statements and, accordingly, a third balance sheet presenting the beginning balance of the period is not required.
A description of the adjustments is as follows: Understatement of Deferred Tax Assets totalling $1.7m related to the timing of recognition differences associated with share based payments.
The Group has corrected this by increasing deferred tax assets with a corresponding decrease to goodwill.
58 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 6 ACQUISITIONS continued Overstatement of a sales tax liability included in Other Current Liabilities totalling $0.8m as a result of inaccurately recording the amount necessary to fulfil a US sales tax obligation through a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement that was required as part of the purchase of 170 Systems, Inc.
The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to $7.1m.
None of the trade receivables have been impaired, and it is expected that the full contractual amounts can be collected.
The goodwill of $22.9m comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and the workforce, which is not separately recognized.
None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on all temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets have been recognized in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
At the date of the Statement of Financial Position, the Group has unrecognized tax losses of $10m: 2010: $25.0m which can be offset against future profits.
Most of these losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Factors that may affect future tax charges The Budget on 23 March 2011 announced that the UK corporation tax rate would decrease to 26% from April 2011, and then decrease to 23% by 1% each year, from April 2012, to be enacted annually.
As the reduction to 26% was substantively enacted at the date of the Statement of Financial Position the UK deferred tax balances are based at a rate of 26%.
The effect of the reduction in the tax rate to 23% on the recognized and unrecognized UK deferred tax balances would be minimal and $636K, respectively.
The effect on the Group of these proposed future changes to the UK tax system will be reflected in the Groups financial statements in future years, as appropriate, as the reductions in UK corporation tax rates are substantively enacted.

NOTE 15 GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the Software cash generating unit, which also forms the sole operating and reportable segment as the Group does not further evaluate or report information that would represent another Cash Generating Unit CGU.
The details of goodwill allocated to the CGU are as follows: $000 Goodwill carrying Goodwill carrying amount amount 2011 2010 CGU Software 134,200 120,949 The recoverable amounts of the CGU have been derived from a value in use calculation, using a 3 year cash flow projection from financial budgets approved by senior management.
These forecasts have then been extrapolated for a further 2 years using managements best estimate of expected growth rates derived from both past performance and expectations within the Software industry.
Forecast operating cash flows are based on past experience, expected sales price, associated margins and future market expectations.
The Group uses in respect of the Software CGU a global blended tax base reflecting the future annual expected effective tax rate.
The other key assumptions are as follows: % CGU CGU Software Software 2011 2010 Discount rate 10.1 10.2 Terminal growth rate 1.85 2.4 In both years the terminal growth rate applies to cash flows beyond 5 years and is based upon managements expectation of long term growth rates.
Discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect managements assessment of specific risks related to the cash generating unit.
The group performs sensitivity analyses to demonstrate that a reasonable change in the key assumptions would not reduce the difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount of goodwill to zero.

Restructuring The restructuring involves the reorganization of the operational structure mainly relating to Hardware sales management layers and the Shared Service Center initiative.
The provision is expected to be largely utilized in the next year.
A respective restructuring charge of $3.2m has been recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement as at June 30, 2011.
This balance comprises redundancy costs only.
Notes to the Financial Statements 69 NOTE 25 PROVISIONS continued Onerous lease As part of the restructuring announced in prior year, a number of the properties under operating leases became onerous.
The yearend provision represents the Directors estimate of the net cost expected to arise across the remaining life of the lease on these empty properties, which is between 1 and 4 years.
The other provisions comprise mainly defined contribution obligations and other different various insignificant amounts.
See discussion in Note 6 relative to contingent consideration.
The contingent consideration of $4.7m arising during the current year in the table above is not included in the movement in provisions in the cash flow statement as it is a noncash item.

The purpose of the financial liabilities is to raise financing for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets including trade receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations.
The principle risks facing the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The policy for managing these risks is set by the Board and implemented by the Groups finance department.
Certain risks are managed centrally, whilst others are managed locally following guidelines communicated by the central finance team.
The Parents exposure is on foreign exchange, interest rate risk and credit risk, which arise predominantly on its cash, intercompany payables and receivables.
The policy for each of the above mentioned risks is outlined in more detail below.
Foreign currency risk The Groups operations are diversified geographically and are therefore exposed to foreign currency risks primarily in respect to the Swiss Franc, British Pound, and Euro.
Furthermore, foreign currency risks arise mainly from commercial transactions and intercompany loans.
Exchange risks resulting from commercial transactions primarily relate to intercompany transactions where Group subsidiaries, with varying functional currencies, purchase software licenses for resale in US Dollars and Euros: however, they typically sell in their local currencies.
The Parent Company is exposed only to foreign currency movements on its foreign currency denominated intercompany loans.
This risk is not deemed to be significant.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable change in the Groups and Parent Companys key currency exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity due to changes in fair values of monetary assets and liabilities.

Interest risk The Group utilizes both fixed and floating interest rates and assesses the risk and reward associated with these rates when acquiring new financial assets or liabilities.
The Group has no significant interest bearing liabilities and is primarily exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the market interest rate on its interest bearing assets.
Assets at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest risks, while interest bearing assets at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest risk.
The Groups floating rate financial assets are based on variable bank deposit rates.
The parent company is exposed to interest rate movements on its intercompany loan arrangements, which are predominantly based upon LIBOR plus an agreed premium, and on its cash.
There is no impact of the exposure to the Group, and the exposure is deemed to be insignificant to the Parent Company.
The sensitivity analysis of the Group shows a reasonable change in the interest which is based on LIBOR plus an agreed premium, adjusted on an annual basis.
The floating rates are based predominantly upon LIBOR plus agreed premium.

The central finance department monitors its risk to a local shortage of funds and ensures that local entities have access to credit facilities by issuing guarantees, Excess cash is transferred to the cash pool run by Kofax Holding AG, which was terminated on June 30, 2011.
Borrowing facilities The Group has no undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at June 30, 2011.
See Subsequent Events Note 37. Credit risk Cash and other short term deposits are invested with top tier banks.
As a consequence of the cash pooling with Fortis Bank, the group has identified a concentration of credit risk.
A risk assessment has been made by management including analysis of the credit quality rating of the bank with no action item resulting.
Furthermore the Group is exposed to credit risks arising from sales transactions.
Credit risks of new customers must be assessed locally before entering into contracts by performing credit check procedures.
The overall Group debtor exposure is monitored centrally.
The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reflect the Groups maximum credit risk exposure, taking into consideration any credit insurance coverage.
Due to the small number of large transactions with individual customers the Group considers the possibility of a credit risk concentration low.
These relate to customers where there has been no history of default.
These amounts are to be considered fully recoverable.
The Directors perform a bad debt review at the year end, taking into account the credit quality of customers, past payment history and current economic conditions.
Overall the credit quality of customers is considered high.
The credit checks performed prior to taking on a new customer are designed to ensure that this quality is upheld.
Hedging activities Kofax does not operate a formal hedging policy, but benefits from natural foreign exchange hedging across the group.
Specific high value future foreign currency transactions are hedged through forward contracts at the discretion of executive management.
Such examples include the forward contract taken to hedge the translation of the hardware business disposal consideration to USD.
At the time the Hardware Business was sold, the Group entered into short-term and long-term forward exchange contracts to match future cash receivable from the buyer.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting for these forward contracts or any other hedging activity.
Where an intercompany loan designated in a foreign currency is deemed to form part of the net investment in a subsidiary, the foreign exchange gain or loss is taken directly to equity.
Capital Management The Directors consider share capital, share premium and retained earnings to be the capital of the Group and Parent Company.
The primary objective with regard to the capital management is to ensure that a strong credit rating and robust capital ratios are maintained in order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
Currently operations are funded by the use of operating cash flows and short term bank facilities.
After careful consideration of the future opportunities for the use of cash, the board decided to suspend payment of dividends until further notice.
NOTE 28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE Categories of financial instruments There is no significant difference between the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group and their carrying value in the accounts.
This is due to management measuring forward contracts at fair value at each year end, large deposits and cash balances in stable currencies and limited exposure to financial liabilities.
Fair value hierarchy The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical asset or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorder fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of deferred consideration has been calculated based on managements review of underlying variables and best assessment regarding the probability of contingent events occurring.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is established based on market value advice received by management from the issuing bank.

No contributions were outstanding at year end.
Notes to the Financial Statements 75 NOTE 29 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued b Defined benefit schemes The table below shows the movements in the net defined benefit obligation across the current and prior year.
Significant defined benefit schemes are operated in Switzerland, Austria, and Italy with two smaller schemes in France and United Arab Emirates.

The cumulative actuarial losses gains recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income since the transition to IFRS amounts to $0.7m 2010: $1.5m.
The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognized on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity on the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income before the transition to IFRS.
The expected contributions payable to the schemes for the next financial year amount in total to $0.9m 2010: $0.8m.
Funded pension scheme - Switzerland The most significant funded pension scheme is operated by two subsidiary undertakings in Switzerland for their employees.
The scheme is managed by a corporate trustee who is accountable to the pension scheme members.
The Directors have reviewed the terms and conditions of the scheme, in particular with regard to the mechanism for funding any deficit that might arise.
Although the scheme has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution scheme, the scheme effectively includes a minimum guaranteed annuity rate, any shortfall in which the trustee would normally ask the employer to contribute to.
76 Notes to the Financial Statements NOTE 29 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued The contributions made during the year by the Group amount to $0.3m 2010 :$ 0.5m.
Contribution rates in percentages of the insured salary payable by the Group vary from 5% to 20%, depending on the age and on the position of the employee.
The pension cost relating to this scheme was assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation, at June 30, 2011, indicated that, on the basis of service to date and current salaries, the schemes assets were sufficient to meet 72% 2010: 66% of its liabilities.
As a result of the disposal of the Hardware business, the Group experienced curtailment gains across most of the pension schemes as many of the Hardware employees were included in these schemes and most were included in the Swiss pension scheme.
The Group recorded these curtailment gains as an offset to pension expense in the operating expenses section of the Income Statement.
The removal of the Hardware Business employees from the schemes is also the primary reason for the reduction of the overall pension liability for the Group.
