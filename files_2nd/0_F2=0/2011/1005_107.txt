Any shares purchased under this authority will either be cancelled or held as treasury shares.
As at March 9, 2012 there were options outstanding over 67,463 ordinary shares, which represent 0.06% of the Companys issued share capital at that date and would represent 0.07% of the Companys issued share capital if the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares were to be exercised in full.
