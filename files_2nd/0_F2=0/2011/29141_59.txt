22 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both loss and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9 and on pages 15 to 18.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.

46 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 March 2011, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments outwith fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value at fair value.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 March is shown below: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Financial Assets 2011 Weighted Weighted 2010 Weighted Weighted Fair value average average period Fair value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Fixed rate: Sterling bonds perpetual 9,761 7.5% n a 9,630 7.6% n a Euro bonds 442 8 years 2,326 3.1% 7 years Floating rate: Sterling bonds interest rate linked to sterling LIBOR 10,697 3.7% 13 years 5,701 3.7% 14 years Euro bonds interest rate linked to euro LIBOR 1,971 2.1% 74 years 1,001 4.5% 75 years Brazilian bonds index linked 117,307 11.5% 34 years 101,836 11.0% 35 years Based on expected maturity date.
The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits of less than one month which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate.
SCOTTISH MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 47 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued 2011 2010 Financial Liabilities 000 000 The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: Floating rate US$ denominated 111,666 65,265 Euro denominated 52,939 Fixed rate Sterling denominated 151,378 151,552 Euro denominated 54,001 Yen denominated 59,969 Swiss franc denominated 37,891 369,984 314,677 The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: In one year or less, or on demand 164,605 163,125 In two to five years 54,001 In more than five years weighted average period fixed 13 years 150,703 150,877 No fixed date for repayment 675 675 369,984 314,677 Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2011 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 16,972,000 2010 14,624,000.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2011 would have decreased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 0.75p 2010 increased by 0.58p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term fluctuations of the benchmark.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 18.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Managers Review Section.
110.0% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in quoted equity valuations at 31 March 2011 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 70,308,000 2010 60,300,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is potentially significant but the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are believed to be readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
48 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: Where the Investment Managers make an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question.
The Board regularly receives information from the Investment Managers on the credit ratings of those bonds and other securities in which the Company has invested.
The Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as agent, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board.
Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Transactions involving derivatives, and other arrangements wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Managers of the creditworthiness of that counterparty.
The Companys aggregate exposure to each such counterparty is monitored regularly by the Board.
Cash is held only at banks that are regularly reviewed by the Managers.
Credit Risk Exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was: 2011 2010 000 000 Fixed interest investments 140,178 120,494 Cash and short term deposits 14,699 18,898 Debtors and prepayments 15,468 9,824 170,345 149,216 None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the balance sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings are included in the accounts in accordance with FRS26.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 833.5p to 816.5p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2011 of 742.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 9.1% as against 11.0% on a debt at par basis.
At 31 March 2010 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 711.2p to 692.8p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2010 of 609.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 12.1% as against 14.4% on a debt at par basis.
Capital Management The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
The capital of the Company is the ordinary share capital see note 13 which is managed in accordance with its investment policy in pursuit of its investment objective, both of which are detailed on page 20.
Shares may be issued and or repurchased as explained on pages 25 and 26.
