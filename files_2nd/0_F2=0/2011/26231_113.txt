148 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES CONTINUED The fair value of financial liabilities are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument and are not based on observable market data.
Non-participating unit linked investment contracts include 13m 2010: 24m valued using significant unobservable inputs and have been classied as level 3.
These liabilities have limited transactions and are backed by property investments.
There have been no significant transfers between any of the levels.

Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predened periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the reported cash ows.
A maturity analysis based on the earliest contractual repayment date would present investment contract liabilities as due on the earliest period of the table because policyholders can exercise cancellation options at their discretion.
In such a scenario, the liability would be reduced due to the application of surrender penalties.
