Principal accounting policies continued The Directors are currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 on its results, financial position and cash flows and do not expect that there will be any material impact on the Groups accounts on adoption of any of the other above standards and interpretations.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2010 and 30 April 2011.
The results of a new subsidiary undertaking are included from the date of its acquisition.
Where an entity has ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary undertaking are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of non-controlling interests is stated at the non-controlling interest's proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the amount of non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of subsidiary undertakings to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition Group revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the hire of vehicles, sale of used vehicles and the supply of related goods and services in the normal course of business, net of value added tax and discounts.
Revenue from vehicle hire is recognised evenly over the hire period and revenue from sales of other related goods and services is recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue from the sale of used vehicles is recognised at the point of sale.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses identified through annual or other tests for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 13 years Brand names 5 to 10 years Non-compete agreements 2 to 4 years Intangible assets other Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed three years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Certain properties were revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS.
These valuations were treated as deemed cost at the time of adopting IFRS for the first time.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight-line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 50 years or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter Plant, equipment & ttings 3 to 10 years Vehicles for hire 3 to 6 years Motor vehicles 3 to 6 years 44 Notes to the accounts Northgate plc annual report and accounts 2011 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight-line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
These depreciation rates have been determined with the anticipation that the net book values at the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the open market values for those vehicles.
Depreciation charges reflect adjustments made as a result of differences between expected and actual residual values of used vehicles, taking into account the further directly attributable costs to sell the vehicles.
Property under construction is not depreciated.
Depreciation commences when these assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
The amounts disclosed relating to the proceeds from disposal of vehicles, the accumulated depreciation relating to the transfer to inventories of vehicles for hire and the depreciation charge of vehicles for hire as disclosed in the 2010 accounts have been restated in these accounts to increase these amounts by 12,368,000 in order to accurately present these figures.
The items affected and the restated amounts are as follows: proceeds from disposal of vehicles of 177,041,000 and depreciation of property, plant and equipment of 242,120,000 in the notes to the cash flow statement: depreciation of property, plant and equipment of 242,120,000 in Note 5 and Note 6: and the charge for the year of 236,881,000 and transfer to inventories of 249,857,000 in Note 16.
There is no change to the 2010 reported profit or cash flows of the Group.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised in an earlier period, the Group reassesses whether there are any indications that such impairment has decreased or no longer exists.
Inventories Used vehicles held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Other inventories comprise spare parts and consumables and are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
45 Notes to the accounts Northgate plc annual report and accounts 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, where recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the items being hedged.
The fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the derivative counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement as a net profit or loss for the period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on the net investment hedges are transferred to the translation reserve.
Bank loans, other loan, loan notes and issue costs Bank loans, other loan and loan notes are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies other than UK Sterling are recorded at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
The net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into UK Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is recognised directly in equity.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are recognised directly in equity, together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated into UK Sterling using average exchange rates for the financial period and variances compared with the exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity.
They are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, with any variances reflected directly in equity.
All foreign exchange differences reflected directly in equity are shown in the translation reserve component of equity.

Principal accounting policies continued Leasing and hire purchase commitments As Lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives using Group policies.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As Lessor: Motor vehicles and equipment hired to customers under operating leases are included within property, plant and equipment.
Income from such leases is taken to the income statement evenly over the period of the operating lease agreement.
Retirement benefit costs The Group predominantly operates defined contribution pension schemes but has one defined benefit scheme.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Pension contributions in respect of one of these arrangements are held in trustee administered funds, independently of the Groups finances.
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with updates to actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The Group also operates group personal pension plans.
The costs of these plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Employee share schemes and share based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and deferred annual bonuses, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and deferred annual bonuses are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity-settled payments granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market based performance criteria not being met.
The Group also operates a share incentive plan under which employees each have the option to purchase an amount of shares annually and receive an equivalent number of free shares.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense evenly throughout the period over which the employees must remain in the employ of the Group in order to receive the free shares.
Interest income and finance costs Interest income and finance costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Directors to be material and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the accounts are to be properly understood.
Dividends Dividends on Ordinary shares are recognised in the period in which they are either paid or formally approved, whichever is earlier.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Principal accounting policies continued Own shares The Group makes open market purchases of its own shares in order to satisfy the requirements of the Groups existing share schemes.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a reduction in shareholder equity.
The carrying values of own shares are compared to their market values at each reporting date and adjustments are made to write down the carrying value of own shares when, in the opinion of the Directors, there is a significant market value reduction.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors have made the following judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts.
Depreciation Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight-line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Group is required to review its depreciation rates and estimated useful lives regularly to ensure that the net book value of disposals of tangible fixed assets are broadly equivalent to their market value.
Intangible assets Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
The Directors have made assumptions with regard to the evidence in the market, at the time of acquisitions, when determining these estimated useful lives.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets Determining whether goodwill and other non-current assets are impaired requires an estimation of their value in use in the cash generating units.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
In determining whether provision is required against any trade receivable, judgment is required in estimating the likely levels of recovery.
In exercising this judgment, consideration is given to both the overall economic environment in which a debtor operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of the nominal balance may be in doubt, for example days sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other qualitative information in respect of a customer.
Taxation The Group carries out tax planning consistent with a Group of its size and makes appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with the tax authorities.
To the extent that tax estimates result in the recognition of deferred tax assets, those assets are only carried in the balance sheet to the extent that it is considered that they are likely to be recovered in the short term.
In the current year, net deferred tax assets totalling 5,928,000 previously derecognised have been recognised as the recovery of those assets is now considered probable in the short term 2010 15,456,000, as explained further in Note 10.

Segmental reporting Management has determined the operating segments based upon the information provided to the executive Board of Directors which is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
The Group is managed and reports internally, on a basis consistent with its two main operating divisions, UK and Spain.
The UK division includes operations in the Republic of Ireland.
The principal activities of these divisions are set out in the Operational Review and Financial Review.

Revenue from sale of vehicles is included as revenue in accordance with IAS 16 which requires used vehicle assets to be classified as inventories.
Used vehicle sales are included within UK and Spain operating segments, which reflects the level at which the executive Board of Directors allocate resources and review performance of the Group.
There is no significant intersegment trading.
Fleet Technique was previously reported as a separate operating segment of the Group.
Due to an ongoing restructuring of the UK business the operations of Fleet Technique have become integrated into the UK segment and as such the results are no longer reported separately to the executive Board of Directors.
Consequently, Fleet Technique is no longer regarded as a separate operating segment.
The comparative information for the year ended 30 April 2010 has been adjusted to reflect this change.
Geographical information Revenues are attributed to countries on the basis of the companys location.
The Directors consider the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to be a single geographical segment on the grounds that the results and net assets of operations in the Republic of Ireland are immaterial to the Group as a whole.
Non-current assets exclude financial instrument assets and deferred tax assets.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.
The net credit for the year can be reconciled to the profit before taxation as stated in the income statement as follows: 2011 2010 000 % 000 % Profit before taxation 26,540 9,615 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 28% 2010 28% 7,431 28.0 2,692 28.0 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 440 1.6 131 1.3 Tax effect of income not taxable in determining taxable profit 615 2.3 Difference in taxation in overseas subsidiary undertakings 70 0.3 470 4.9 Recognition of deferred tax assets below 5,928 22.3 15,456 160.7 Reduction in UK tax rate 112 0.4 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior years 4,139 15.6 2,578 26.8 Tax credit and effective tax rate for the year 2,853 10.7 14,741 153.3 In addition to the amount credited to the income statement, a net deferred tax amount of 1,509,000 has been charged 2010 4,102,000 credited directly to equity Note 25.
Deferred tax assets of 5,928,000 previously derecognised have been recognised in the current year as the recovery of those assets is now considered probable in the short term on the basis of anticipated future profits 2010 15,456,000.
On 1 April 2011 the UK Corporation tax rate changed from 28% to 26%.
Accordingly, the tax disclosures reflect deferred tax measured on the new 26% rate.
The rate is also proposed to be 23% by 1 April 2014.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the further 3% reduction, although this will further reduce the Group's future tax charge and reduce the deferred tax liabilities and assets of the Group and of the Company accordingly.
Dividends No dividends were paid in the year 2010 - Nil.
The Directors do not propose a final dividend for the year ended 30 April 2011.

Goodwill 2011 2010 Group 000 000 Carrying value: At 1 May 2010 and 30 April 2011 3,589 3,589 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Fleet Technique Limited, the business of which has now been integrated into the UK business.
As a result there are now only two cash generating units - the UK and Spain.
The test for impairment of goodwill has been carried out as part of the impairment assessment of the UK business based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2011 with a growth rate of 2% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, and a discount rate of 10%.
The recoverable amount was in excess of the current book value and accordingly, no provision for impairment has been recognised.

Borrowings Borrowings comprise bank loans, loan notes, property loans and other borrowings.
Except as detailed in Note 39, the Directors consider that the carrying amounts of the Groups borrowings approximate to their fair value.
Bank loans Bank loans are secured and bear interest at rates of 1.20% to 3.25% 2010 - 0.75% to 3.25% above the relevant interest rate index, being LIBOR for UK Sterling denominated debt and EURIBOR for Euro denominated debt.

Borrowings continued Loan notes In 2006 and 2007, the Company issued unsecured loan notes to investors principally based in the United States.
The total of the loan notes the US Notes issued by the Group was US$357,000,000 and 21,000,000.
In addition, and in accordance with the terms of the US Notes, make-whole notes amounting to $7,530,000 and 456,000 were issued 2010 - $4,981,000 and 297,000, all of which on their issue had a maturity of September 2012 and otherwise had the same terms as the related loan notes.
During the year, all make-whole notes were repaid in full.
These factors expose the Group to foreign currency exchange risk.
As explained in further detail in Note 23, the Group has entered into cross currency swap financial instruments in order to mitigate this risk.
Both the weighted average fixed interest rate on the US Notes and the overall weighted average fixed interest rate taking into account the interest rates within the cross currency swap instruments are shown in the table above.
Other loan During the year, the Company entered into an eight year 100,000,000 secured term loan which is repayable in three equal instalments in October 2017, April 2018 and April 2019.
Interest is payable at 4.25% above LIBOR.
The loan is stated net of unamortised finance fees incurred in relation to entering into this loan agreement.
Cumulative Preference shares The cumulative Preference shares of 50p each entitle the holder to receive a cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5% on the paid up capital and the right to a return of capital at either winding up or a repayment of capital.
The cumulative Preference shares do not entitle the holders to any further or other participation in the profits or assets of the Company.
These shares have no voting rights other than in exceptional circumstances.
The total number of authorised cumulative Preference shares of 50p each is 1,300,000 2010 1,300,000, of which 1,000,000 2010 1,000,000 were allotted and fully paid at the balance sheet date.
Property loans All property loans relate to land and buildings held in Spain and are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
The loans are secured on the properties to which they relate.
The average remaining lease term is two years 2010 - two years.
At 30 April 2011, the average borrowing rate for property loans was 2.1% 2010 1.5%.
All loans are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.

At 30 April 2011, the amount drawn entirely related to supplier confirming facilities on which the Group pays no interest.
It is common practice in Spain for businesses to have a bank facility which enables their suppliers to be paid earlier than under normal credit terms.
When this is the case the supplier pays to Northgate Espaas bank a discount fee for early settlement.
When invoices fall due for payment, Northgate Espaa settles such invoices with its bank.
At 30 April 2010, the drawn amount entirely related to debt discounting facilities on which interest was chargeable at a range of 0.5% to 1.25% above EURIBOR.
Total borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities at the balance sheet date, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Less than one year 14,135 10,444 In one year to five years 113,866 144,197 128,001 154,641 The total amount permitted to be borrowed by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in terms of the Articles of Association shall not exceed six times the aggregate of the issued share capital of the Company and Group reserves, as defined in those Articles.

Borrowings continued Financial instruments see also Note 39 Financial assets The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk associated with trade receivables in Spain is more concentrated in larger customers than the UK and, consequently, as in the UK the Group has a credit insurance policy in place to mitigate this risk.
Treasury policies and the management of risk The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably.
Treasury operations manage the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only.
Consistent with Group policy, Group Treasury does not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using more complex financial instruments.
Further details regarding derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 23.
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only minimal exposures, with banks and other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to major credit agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed and which maintain a Double A rating.
Individual aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk The Groups policy is to finance operating subsidiary undertakings by a combination of retained earnings, loan notes, other loans and bank borrowings, including medium term bank loans.
Cash at bank and on deposit yield interest based principally on interest rate indices applicable to periods of less than three months, those indices being LIBOR for Sterling denominated cash and EURIBOR for Euro denominated cash.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives as detailed in Note 23.
These derivatives are also used to manage the Groups desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the interest cost on outstanding debt.
At 30 April 2011, 84% 2010 71% of gross borrowings were at fixed or capped rates of interest, comprising 100,000,000 and 212,832,000 of interest rate swaps, $256,907,000 of US Dollar Sterling cross-currency swaps and 15,631,000 of Sterling denominated loan notes 2010 63,000,000 and 200,000,000 of interest rate swaps, $322,840,000 of US Dollar Sterling cross-currency swaps and forward contracts and 18,995,000 of Sterling denominated loan notes, as detailed in Note 23.
Foreign currency exchange risk The Group maintains borrowings in the same currency as its cash requirements, with the exception of borrowings maintained in Euro as net investment hedges against its Euro denominated investments Note 23 and with the exception of US Dollar denominated loan notes, as explained above.

All the Groups interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and their fair value to the point of either maturity or termination, along with changes in fair value in the current year, were deferred in equity.
To the extent that the interest rate swaps were not 100% effective, a net amount of Nil 2010 Nil has been credited to the income statement.
The total change in fair values of interest rate derivatives charged to the income statement of Nil 2010 253,000 is shown within finance costs Note 9.
Cross-currency derivatives Market values have been used to determine fair values of cross-currency derivatives at each balance sheet date.
The estimated fair values are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps 882 12,708 Sterling US Dollar forward contracts 161 Euro Sterling cross-currency swaps 1,034 148 152 12,721 Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps The Group has in issue US Dollar denominated loan notes of capital value $256,907,000 2010 $322,840,000 which bear fixed rate interest in US Dollars.
The payment of this interest and the capital repayment of the loan notes at maturity expose the Group to foreign exchange risk.
To mitigate this risk, the Group has entered into a series of Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps.
The effective start dates and termination dates of these contracts are the same as the loan notes against which hedging relationships are designated and which are shown in Note 22.

This matches the exchange difference on retranslation of the loan notes at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, leaving a net impact of Nil in the income statement.
The gross exchange difference on retranslation of the loan notes at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date was a gain of 15,315,000 2010 - 11,654,000.
In addition, the amount includes the amortisation of the interest legs of the terminated swaps over their residual life.
The amount recycled to the translation reserve represents the movement on the foreign exchange elements of the total fair value of the derivative subsequent to the designation of the Euro Sterling swap as a net investment hedge.
The net fair value remaining in the hedging reserve represents the fair value of the interest rate element of the derivatives Note 31.
Net investment hedges The Group manages its exposure to currency fluctuations on retranslation of the balance sheets of those subsidiary undertakings whose functional currency is in Euro by maintaining a proportion of its borrowings in the same currency.
In addition, the Group has entered into a number of Sterling Euro cross-currency swaps which are designated as net investment hedges.
The hedging objective is to reduce the risk of spot retranslation of the Euro subsidiaries from Euro to Sterling at each reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the borrowings and net investment hedges have been recognised directly within equity along with the exchange differences on retranslation of the net assets of the Euro subsidiaries.
Between 1 May 2009 and 11 September 2009, exchange differences on the retranslation of Euro borrowings exceeded the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the balance sheets of the Euro denominated subsidiary undertakings by 252,000.
This amount was credited to finance costs in the prior year Note 9.
Subsequent to 11 September 2009, exchange differences on the retranslation of Euro borrowings were less than the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the balance sheets of the Euro denominated subsidiary undertakings.
Except as stated above, the hedges are considered highly effective in the current and prior year.
Company current derivative financial asset At 30 April 2011, the Company held Sterling Euro cross-currency swaps with a subsidiary undertaking which had a fair value of 3,301,000 2010 Nil and weighted average remaining life of one year with a weighted average Euro interest receivable of 2.79% and weighted average GBP interest payable of 2.23%.
Current tax The current tax creditor of 16,712,000 at 30 April 2011 2010 16,439,000 includes a total amount of 13,997,000 2010 13,422,000 that is considered unlikely to give rise to a cash outflow within 12 months of the balance sheet date but is shown in the balance sheet as a current liability in order to satisfy the requirements of IAS 1.
The expected cash outflow in respect of corporate tax in the 12 months following the 30 April 2011 balance sheet date is, therefore, 2,715,000.

Financing fees written off on extinguishment of debt Details relating to the refinancing of the Group, which was completed during April 2011, are set out in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 19.
As part of this refinancing, a new eight year term loan facility was provided by M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and an element of these new funds was used to repay part of the existing bank and loan note borrowings of each lender at the date of the refinancing.

Exceptional items continued Termination of Euro interest rate swaps As explained in Note 23, in April 2011, 87,168,000 Euro interest rate swaps were closed out at a cash cost of 473,000.
The net amount deferred into equity at that date of 473,000 2010 Nil was expensed in the income statement.
Termination of cross-currency swaps As explained in Note 23, in April 2011, cross-currency swaps with a notional amounts of $6,122,000 and 575,000 were closed out at a total cash cost of 423,000 2010 Nil.

Covenant deferral fees In the early part of the prior year, the Group was engaged in renegotiating the terms of certain of its borrowings.
As a result, the Group incurred fees of Nil 2010 2,199,000 payable to certain lenders to defer testing of covenants at 31 July 2009.
Make-whole premium on US loan notes As part of the refinancing of its borrowings in September 2009, the Group incurred fees of Nil 2010 8,842,000 in relation to makewhole notes issued to the US loan noteholders, which arose from amortisation of the existing notes during the year and in respect of future scheduled borrowing amortisations.
Unamortised fees Unamortised financing fees of Nil 2010 3,751,000 were written off in respect of the borrowing facilities replaced in September 2009.
Other financing fees Other financing fees of Nil 2010 424,000 were payable relating to the refinancing of borrowings in September 2009.
Impairment of assets The Group tests its cash generating units CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that assets might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth rates forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
In accordance with IAS 36, the impairment of each CGU recorded in 2009 was allocated firstly against goodwill and then to the extent that the impairment exceeded the book value of the goodwill, the excess impairment was then allocated against the remaining assets of the CGU on a pro-rata basis with the exception of assets already carried at their recoverable amount or otherwise excluded from the scope of the Standard.
In addition to the annual test of impairment referred to above, and as required by IAS 36, in the current year there has been an assessment as to whether there has been any indication that the impairment loss recognised in an earlier year has decreased or no longer exists.
This assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2011 using growth rates of 1% to 3% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 10% for the UK CGU and 10% for the Spanish CGU.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spanish CGU.
In the prior year, an assessment was performed to determine whether there had been any indication that the impairment loss recognised in 2009 had decreased or no longer existed.
This assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2010 using growth rates of 1% to 4% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 7% for the UK CGUs and 7% for the Spanish CGUs.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for the UK CGUs.
In respect of Record Rent a Car S. A. and Alquiservicios LSL S. A. there was an aggregate reversal of 11,600,000 of which 11,000,000 related to vehicles for hire, 300,000 to other intangible assets and 300,000 to other property, plant and equipment.

Retirement benefit schemes During the year the Group operated two group personal pension plans and The Willhire Pension Scheme the Scheme, which includes both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The total operating pension cost to the Group of all these arrangements was 1,425,000 2010 1,948,000 all of which related to the defined contribution schemes.
The Scheme The Scheme, which is established under Trust, is financed through separate trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
The Scheme is closed to both new members and to future service accrual for existing members.
Contributions to the Scheme are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent actuarial valuation of the fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed at 6 April 2010 by JLT Pension Capital Strategies.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method and the following principal assumptions set out below.

Amounts recognised as costs income in respect of the Scheme are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Interest cost 244 229 Expected return on plan assets 171 125 Total pension charge 73 104 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported directly in equity, within retained earnings.
The cumulative net amount of actuarial gains reflected directly in equity since 3 February 2006 is 94,000 2010 263,000.
The actual return on the scheme assets was a gain of 235,000 2010 664,000.
There are no reimbursement rights.

The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on bonds.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long term relationship between each asset class and the bond returns and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
The analysis of the Scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Expected Fair value Expected Fair value return of assets return of assets % 000 % 000 Equity instruments 5.0 1,657 5.0 1,559 Debt instruments 3.0 2,782 3.0 2,148 Other 3.0 251 3.0 255 4,690 3,962 78 Notes to the accounts Northgate plc annual report and accounts 2011 38.

During the current year, contributions totalled 639,000 in accordance with latest actuarial advice received.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid to the Scheme during the year ended 30 April 2012 is 510,000.

Financial instruments The following disclosures and analysis relate to the Groups financial instruments, as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 26 to 34.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 22 and 23.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling and US Dollars and Sterling, where Sterling is the functional currency of the Group.
As explained in more detail below and in Note 23, identical key terms between US Dollar denominated loan note liabilities and Sterling US Dollar cross-currency derivatives mean that the profit and loss and equity of the Group is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Sterling.
This means that the material sensitivity of the profit or loss and equity of the Group to exchange rate movements arises due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling only.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 0.10 2010 0.10 increase and decrease in the Euro Sterling exchange rate.
A 0.10 2010 0.10 movement in the rate in either direction is managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates in the near term.
The sensitivity analysis includes only any outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 0.10 2010 0.10 change in foreign currency rates.
As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 0.10 increase 0.10 decrease 2011 000 000 000 Total equity 339,759 336,891 343,190 79 Notes to the accounts Northgate plc annual report and accounts 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 39.
Financial instruments continued As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 0.10 increase 0.10 decrease 2010 000 000 000 Total equity 305,106 304,250 306,564 There is no material impact on the income statement in either year.
Sterling US Dollar Cross-currency derivatives As explained in Note 23, the Group has Sterling US Dollar cross-currency derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange movements between US Dollars, the denomination of loan note liabilities, and Sterling, the functional currency of the Group.
The movement in fair value of these derivatives is a function of both the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate and market interest rates prevailing in the United Kingdom and United States.
As a result of the key terms of the cross-currency derivatives and the loan notes, against which a hedging relationship is designated, being identical, any gains or losses on foreign exchange included in the fair value of the Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps are transferred to the income statement and are exactly offset in the income statement by an equal and opposite amount on retranslation of the US dollar loan notes to the closing rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, leaving a net impact of Nil on the income statement for all Sterling US Dollar exchange rates.
The net impact on the hedging reserve, arising from these particular derivatives, therefore represents only the gain or loss on the interest rate element of the fair value of the derivatives, as explained further in Note 23.
Consequently, any fluctuation in the rate of the US Dollar has no impact on either profit and loss or equity.
Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities within the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap and collar contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate liabilities and related derivatives.
For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over the period and average rate applicable for the period.
In all instances it is assumed that any derivatives designated in hedging relationships are 100% effective.
A 1.0% 2010 1.0% increase or decrease has been used in the analyses and represents managements best estimate of a reasonably possible change in interest rate in the near term.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal Fair value fixed interest rate amount Outstanding receive floating pay 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 fixed contracts % % 000 000 000 000 Sterling In the second year 2.44% 63,000 610 In the third to fifth years inclusive 2.44% 63,000 1,060 After five years 3.62% 100,000 2,336 Euro In the second year 2.35% 212,832 2,455 In the third to fifth years inclusive 2.35% 174,060 5,833 Outstanding pay floating receive fixed contracts Sterling In the second year 1.13% 63,000 24 Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 22 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
All interest cash flows and the weighted average effective interest rate have been calculated using interest rate conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.

The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amounts disclosed have been determined by reference to the floating rates applicable at the balance sheet date, which have then been used to project future cash flows.

Financial instruments continued All the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: U Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and U The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
Except as detailed in the following table, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate swaps and cross-currency derivatives, are held at fair value: Carrying amount Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Financial liabilities Loan notes 161,718 223,324 193,867 255,090 Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.

This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, approximately 781,000 2010 2,203,000 is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no other customers who represent more than five per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK and Spain.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 17,072,000 2010 17,958,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and mainly unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
