Sharebased payments continued Stock Purchase Plan US based employees including executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Victrex 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The price payable for each ordinary share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant or the date of purchase.
Awards may be granted over a number of ordinary shares determined by the amount employees have saved by the end of a one year savings period.
There are no outstanding options as at balance sheet date 2010: nil.
Victrex 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan 1999 LTIP The 1999 LTIP came to the end of its ten year life in 2009.
Each year executive Directors were eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 100% of basic salary.
The awards have normally become exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment and the Groups performance over the three year period commencing at the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
The extent to which an award has been exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS : the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 12.5% on a pro rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance.
Notwithstanding these provisions, no shares will vest under this performance condition unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group over the relevant performance period: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 10% on a pro rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.

Each year executive Directors, and senior executives by invitation, are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employees annual base salary.
Awards normally vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Companys Group.
Participants will have a five year period from the date each tranche vests in which to exercise awards structured as nil or nominal cost options.
Participants will receive a payment in cash and or shares on or shortly following the vesting of their awards, of an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares between the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
Alternatively, participants may have their awards increased as if dividends were paid on the shares subject to their award and then reinvested in further shares.
The extent to which an award will be exercisable is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups EPS: the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.

All share options are granted under a service condition and for ESOS, ESOP and LTIP a nonmarket condition EPS.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of services received.
In addition, the LTIP has a market condition TSR, which was taken into account in the grant date measurement of fair value.
