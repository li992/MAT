The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and liabilities which are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments and financial interest in property assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 2. b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities including special purposes entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
ii Goodwill and impairment The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of net identifiable assets including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Costs attributable to an acquisition are expensed in the consolidated income statement under the heading Other income and expenses.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption on the statement of financial position.
Goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
