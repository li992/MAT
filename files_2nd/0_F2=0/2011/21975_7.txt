Segment information The groups operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the BT Group plc Operating Committee, which is the key management committee and represents the chief operating decision maker.
The BT Group plc Operating Committee is chaired by the BT Group plc Group Chief Executive and the other members are the BT Group plc Group Finance Director and the Chief Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale, BT Global Services, BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate.
The Chief Executive of Openreach, the BT Group plc Company Secretary and the Group HR Director also normally attend all meetings.
The groups organisational structure reects the different customer groups to which it provides communications products and services via its four customer-facing lines of business, supported by two internal service units.
The four customer-facing lines of business are the groups reportable segments and generate substantially all the groups revenue.
Their operations are summarised as follows: BT Global Services provides managed networked IT services to multinational corporations, domestic businesses and national and local government organisations operating in more than 170 countries worldwide.
BT Retail provides communication products and services to the consumer market and provides IT and communications services to SMEs.
BT Retail includes BT Ireland which operates across the major corporate, SME, consumer and wholesale markets throughout the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
BT Retail also includes BT Enterprises which comprises a number of individual businesses including BT Conferencing, BT Directories, BT Expedite, BT Redcare & Payphones and BT Openzone.
BT Wholesale provides products and a broad range of voice, broadband and data communications services, including managed services for xed and mobile network operators, internet service providers and telecoms resellers in the UK.
Openreach is responsible for last mile of the UK access network the copper wires and bre connecting homes and businesses to their local telephone exchange via xed-line local and backhaul connections.
Openreach customers, which comprise UK communication providers and other BT lines of business, are offered fair, equal and open access to its networks.
BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate are internal service units which support the four customer-facing lines of business.
BT Innovate & Design is responsible for the development, design and delivery of the platforms, systems and processes which support the provision of the groups products and services.
BT Operate is responsible for managing BTs IT and network infrastructure platforms.
BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate operate on a full cost recovery basis.
The costs incurred by BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate are allocated to the customerfacing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
The depreciation and amortisation incurred by BT Operate in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the customer-facing lines of business are allocated to the lines of business based on their respective utilisation.
Capital expenditure incurred by BT Innovate & Design for specic projects undertaken on behalf of the customer-facing lines of business is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred.
Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular line of business, capital expenditure is allocated based on the proportion of estimated future economic benets.
Capital expenditure incurred by BT Operate is allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the proportion of operating cost recoveries.
BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate and the groups centralised functions are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments for any of the years presented.
Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and thus line of business profitability can be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
The majority of the internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the market-facing lines of business both directly, and also indirectly, through BT Operate which is included in the Other segment.
Internal revenue arising in BT Retail relates primarily to BT Ireland and Enterprises.
Internal revenue in BT Wholesale relates to the sale of line cards and access electronic services to BT Openreach.
In addition to the four customer-facing lines of business, the remaining operations of the group are aggregated and included within the Other category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group.
The Other category includes costs associated with the groups centralised functions including procurement and supply chain, eet and property management.
Provisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the Other segment.
On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the relevant lines of business results, offset in the group results by the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the Other segment.
Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the denition of specic items as detailed on page 33.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is provided below.
Performance is measured based on adjusted EBITDA, dened as EBITDA before specic items, as included in the internal financial reports reviewed by the BT Group plc Operating Committee.
EBITDA is dened as the operating profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the lines of business because it reects the underlying cash by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specic items which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
Specic items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reects how they are reported to the Operating Committee of BT Group plc.
Finance expense and income is not allocated to the reportable segments as this activity is managed by the central treasury function which manages the overall net debt position of the group.

Related party transactions Key management personnel are deemed to be the Chairman, non-executive directors and members of the Operating Committee of BT Group plc as described in note 1.
Of the seven 2010: seven, 2009: seven members of the BT Group plc Operating Committee, three 2010: three, 2009: four were members of the Board of the ultimate parent company.
It is the BT Group plc Operating Committee which has responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group.
Key management personnel compensation is shown in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Salaries and short-term benets 11.4 10.3 8.4 Termination benets 0.1 2.4 Post employment benets 1.4 1.8 2.3 Share-based payments 5.3 2.6 3.6 18.1 14.8 16.7 During 2011 the group purchased services in the normal course of business and on an arms length basis from its principal associate, Tech Mahindra Limited.
The net value of services purchased was 258m 2010: 301m, 2009: 296m and the amount outstanding and payable for services at 31 March 2011 was 61m 2010: 65m, 2009: 89m.
In 2010 a cash payment of 127m was made to Tech Mahindra Limited for the renegotiation of certain supply contracts as part of the rationalisation of procurement channels within BT Global Services.
Amounts paid to the groups retirement benefit plans are set out in note 23.
There were a number of transactions during the year between the company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are eliminated on consolidation and therefore not disclosed.
British Telecommunications plc acts as a funder and deposit taker for cash related transactions for both its parent and ultimate parent company.
The loan arrangements described below with these companies reect this.
Cash transactions usually arise where the parent and ultimate parent company are required to meet their external payment obligations or receive amounts from third parties.
These principally relate to the payment of dividends, the buy back of shares and the exercise of share options.
Transactions between the ultimate parent company, parent company and the group are settled on both a cash and non-cash basis through these loan accounts depending on the nature of the transaction.
In the 2002 financial year, the group demerged its former mobile phone business and as a result BT Group plc became the listed ultimate parent company of the remaining group.
The demerger steps resulted in the formation of an intermediary holding company, BT Group Investments Limited, between BT Group plc and British Telecommunications plc.
This intermediary company held an investment of 18.5bn in British Telecommunications plc which was funded by an intercompany loan facility with British Telecommunications plc.
A summary of the balances with the parent and ultimate parent companies and the finance income or expense arising in respect of these balances is set out below: 2011 2010 Asset Finance Asset Finance liability income liability income at 31 March expense at 31 March expense Notes m m m m Amounts owed by to parent company Loan facility non-current assets investments 15 10 17,339 248 17,785 282 Loan facility current asset investments 15 1,206 n a 705 n a Trade and other receivables 19 32 n a 14 n a Loans and other borrowings 20 32 53 Trade and other payables 22 90 n a 173 n a Amounts owed by to ultimate parent company Non-current assets investments 15 682 160 Current asset investments 15 13 n a n a Loans and other borrowings 20 10 1 Trade and other payables 22 7 n a 10 n a The loan facility with the parent company accrued interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 50 basis points, is subject to an overall maximum of 25bn, and is either repayable on demand or on 2 February 2015.
In 2011 the overall loan investment balances were maintained at the same level as prior year with the mix increasing the level of short-term loans.
The parent company primarily nances its obligations on the loan as they fall due through dividends paid by the company.
The company holds ordinary shares in the ultimate parent company, disclosed in note 15.
These shares are held in trust for the BT Group Incentive Share Plan, the Retention Share Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan.

Retirement benets were accruing to one director 2010: one under a dened benets pension scheme and one 2010: one director under a money purchase scheme.
During the year no director exercised options 2010: none under BT Group share option plans.
Three directors who held ofce for the whole or part of the year 2010: three received or are entitled to receive 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc under BT long-term incentive plans.

He is entitled to receive 5,348,363 BT Group plc 5p ordinary shares under BT long-term incentive plans subject to continuous employment and in some cases to certain performance conditions being met.
There are no retirement benets accruing to the highest paid director under a dened benefit scheme.
Included in the above aggregate emoluments are those of Ian Livingston and Tony Chanmugam who are also directors of the ultimate holding company, BT Group plc.

Share-based payments The ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, operates an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are settled in equity instruments shares and options of BT Group plc.
Details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the United States, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADSs quarterly at a price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the end of each quarterly purchase period.
Share plans Incentive Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Retention Share Plan Under the BT Group Incentive Share Plan ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
In 2010 the corporate performance measures for the ISP was amended.
For all ISP awards made, 50% of each share award is linked to a total shareholder return target TSR for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period and the remaining 50% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure.
The comparator group contains European telecommunications companies and companies which are either similar in size or market capitalisation and or have a similar business mix and spread to BT.
For ISP awards prior to 2010, a single corporate performance measure was used, being BTs TSR measured against a comparator group of companies from the European telecommunications sector.
Under the BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Under the BT Group Retention Share Plan RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest annually in tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the employee is still employed by the group.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP, DBP and RSP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP The ESIP is an HMRC approved plan.
It allows BT employees to buy shares with contributions of up to 1,500 per tax year out of gross pay directshare and allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years UK allshare.
In 2008 UK allshare was replaced by free broadband for all BT employees in the UK.
Employees outside the UK continued to receive awards of shares where practicable Allshare International, otherwise they received cash awards equivalent to the value of free shares.

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT Group plc and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BT Group plcs historical volatility which is expected to reect the BT Group plc share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Sharesave options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the RSP and DBP were determined using the market price of the shares at the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for RSP awards granted in 2011 was 163p 2010: 104p, 2009: 151p.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2011 was 131p 2010: 131p, 2009: 203p.

Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services and BT Retails business units: BT Consumer, BT Business, BT Ireland and BT Enterprises.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2009 1,240 57 44 16 140 1,497 Acquisitions through business combinations 1 1 Disposals, adjustments and reclassications 9 8 17 5 23 2 Exchange differences 52 4 56 At 1 April 2010 1,180 65 61 21 113 1,440 Acquisitions through business combinations 6 6 Reclassications 15 15 a Impairment charges 39 39 Exchange differences 37 5 42 At 31 March 2011 1,110 65 46 21 123 1,365 a The goodwill impairment charges recognised in 2011 mainly relate to an operational restructuring of a business acquired several years ago.

Intangible assets continued The key assumptions used in performing value in use calculations in 2011 are as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Discount rate 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% Perpetuity growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% The key assumptions used in performing value in use calculations in 2010 were as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Discount rate 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% Perpetuity growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash ow projections derived from financial plans approved by the BT Group plc Board covering a three-year period and a further two years approved by the line of business and group senior management team.
They reect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash ows are also adjusted downwards to reect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sector in which the CGU operates.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
Sensitivities For the BT Retail CGUs, significant headroom exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 887m.
