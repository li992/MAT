Financial risk management Group Currency risk The Group currently exports 98% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2011 is 3.8m, 3.6m and 0.8m respectively 2010: 3.1m, 2.9m and 0.6m.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on equity for 2011 is 1.3m, 0.2m and 0.5m 2010: 1.3m, 0.4m and 0.4m respectively.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges a proportion of sales, and occasionally purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 31.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any shortterm imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows: As at 30 September 2011 As at 30 September 2010 Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Current assets 48.4 0.9 80.2 2.2 Current liabilities 91.9 3.2 50.7 2.3 140.3 2.3 130.9 0.1 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2011 will be recognised in the income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
At 30 September 2011, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
During the year, 0.1m relating to forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2011 was released to the income statement 2010: 0.2m.
Credit risk The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
The Board receives a detailed breakdown every month of all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue across the Group and, in the case of the latter, the relevant action being taken.

Financial risk management continued Group continued Credit risk continued Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2011 2010 As at 30 September m m Amounts neither past due nor impaired 17.8 15.7 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 2.1 2.0 3060 days 0.5 0.1 More than 60 days 1.5 0.1 Total past due but not impaired 4.1 2.2 Amounts impaired 0.3 0.4 Impairment allowances 0.3 0.4 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 21.9 17.9 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2011 2010 m m At beginning of year 0.4 0.4 Utilisation of allowance 0.1 At end of year 0.3 0.4 Amounts receivable from the Groups major customer are not considered to pose a significant credit risk based on historic payment behaviour, strict credit terms and the customers size and strength.
The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established, international banks.
As at 30 September 2011, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 29.0m 2010: 24.2m for the Group.
As at 30 September 2011, the mark to market exposure on forward foreign exchange contracts was a net liability position with any single bank, due to the weakening of Sterling against US Dollar and Japanese Yen 2010: net gain of 0.1m.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient shortterm and longterm funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a committed bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility was renewed in 2007 and expires in September 2012.
As at 30 September 2011 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 72.3m.
Interest rate risk The Group had no shortterm borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Although the Group does hold substantial cash balances, its exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be significant.
com Overview p15 Business Review p621 Governance p2243 Financial Statements p4476 Shareholder Information p7785 Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board regularly reviews the Groups capital structure and when deemed necessary may take action to adjust it.
This was demonstrated by the payment in February 2011 of a special dividend to shareholders in addition to the final dividend for the year ended September 2010.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2012, although there is a resolution proposed at each Annual General Meeting AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.
The Groups capital and equity ratio is as follows: 2011 2010 As at 30 September m m Total equity 221.6 211.3 Total assets 287.8 279.0 Equity ratio 77% 76% Summary of categories of financial assets and liabilities Carrying Carrying amount and amount and fair value fair value 2011 2010 As at 30 September m m Financial assets Derivative instruments designated as fair value through profit and loss FVTPL 0.1 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 0.9 2.1 Loans and receivables 23.0 18.2 Cash and cash equivalents 72.3 77.3 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 3.2 2.3 Trade and other payables 29.5 25.1 The maturity profile and basis of the fair value calculation of the derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships and trade receivables are given on pages 62 to 64.
For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.
Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings.
As a result of US Dollar denominated intragroup loans with subsidiary undertakings, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not actively manage the risk of exchange rate movements given that the counterparty to the loans is a subsidiary of the Company and therefore any gains or losses would be eliminated at Group level.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar rate on these loans is 1.0m.
These intragroup loans are financial assets designated as loans and receivables.
As at 30 September 2011 the Company has intragroup loans outstanding totalling 20.7m 2010: nil.
These loans are over terms of 78 years at interest rates of 7.157.40%.
