This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of re-opening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.

Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, BDO Investment Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The employees contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Main assumptions: Rate of salary increases 5.50 5.70 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.30 3.40 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.80 3.70 Discount rate 5.50 5.50 Inflation assumption 3.50 3.70 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 6.30 6.65 Bonds 3.90 4.00 Other 0.50 0.50 For the years ended 31 March 2011 and 2010, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used: 2011 2010 Years Years Male pensioners 24.3 24.1 Female pensioners 25.3 26.6 Non-retired males 26.5 27.0 Non-retired females 27.6 28.9 Member contributions were 7.5% 2010 7.5% of pensionable salary and Company contributions were 3,647,000 2010 2,239,000 including a one-off contribution of 2,500,000.
The total contributions in 2012 are expected to be approximately 1,593,000.

This resulted in an actuarial gain of 750,000 which has been accounted for as a change of assumption.
Analysis of movements in the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations during the year are analysed as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 At 1 April 52,428 36,313 Current service costs 1,130 834 Contributions by employees 391 418 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 2,897 2,428 Benefits paid 980 812 Premiums paid 44 53 Actuarial gain loss 6,516 13,300 At 31 March 49,306 52,428 The above defined benefit obligation arises from a plan that is wholly funded.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income of 8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income before 1 April 2004. b German defined benefit schemes There are two defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH.
