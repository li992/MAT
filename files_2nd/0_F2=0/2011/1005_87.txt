The exploration and evaluation costs comprise expenditure that is directly attributable to the Trefi and Panorama coal projects in British Columbia, Canada.
Royalty interests represent the net smelter royalties acquired on the Four Mile project in South Australia, the Salamanca uranium project in Spain, the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects in Northern Ontario, Canada and a number of exploration licences in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada, together with the gross revenue royalties on the Amap iron ore system in Brazil and the Isua iron ore project in Greenland and three exploration licences, including the Railway iron ore deposit, in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia.
The net smelter royalties on the exploration licences in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada have been impaired as a result of the inherent uncertainty of these licences entering commercial production.
The impairment charge has reduced the carrying value to nil note 10.
The Group will continue to review the development of these licences on an annual basis.
The Amap royalty interest is the only producing interest and therefore, subject to amortisation.
Amortisation of the remaining interests will commence once they begin commercial production.
No intangible assets have been pledged as security for liabilities.

The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices.
Unquoted investments and royalty options are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined.
In the absence of an active market for these securities, the Group considers each unquoted security to ensure there has been no material change in the fair value since initial recognition.
Further guidance on fair value measurement is provided in note 3.
