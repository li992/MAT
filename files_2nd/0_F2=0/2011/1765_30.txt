2 Other intangibles includes patents, trademarks, software and internally funded development costs.
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment testing In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to valuein-use calculations, with the exception of the Safety Products business within Land & Armaments which is based on fair value less costs to sell.
The value-in-use calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historic experience, available government spending data and the Groups order book.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.37% 2010 7.28% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the cash-generating unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.

The Group monitors changes in defence budgets on an ongoing basis.
Whilst there is uncertainty as to the impact of potential deficit reduction actions on US government spending in 2013 and beyond, the future cash flow projections used in the IBP include an assumption regarding both the level and composition of US defence expenditure.
The headroom, calculated as the difference between the allocated goodwill as at 31 December 2011 and the value-in-use calculations, for the CGUs listed above is shown below.
The table also shows the headroom assuming a 1% reduction in the final year growth rate assumption used in the value-in-use calculations.

The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
Impairment goodwill In 2011, the impairment charge of 94m comprises the Safety Products business within the Land & Armaments CGU 60m and Surface Ships 34m.
The impairment in respect of the Safety Products business reflects the agreement, in December 2011, to sell the business at a price below its total carrying value.
The Surface Ships impairment reflects the underperformance of its export ship contracts.
The pre-tax discount rate was 10.4%.
In 2010, the total goodwill impairment charge of 84m mainly arose in Surface Ships 70m reflecting the underperformance of the ex-VT Group export ship contracts.
Impairment intangible assets In 2011, the impairment charge of 15m relates to the Land & Armaments business within the Platforms & Services US reporting segment and includes 6m in respect of the Safety Products business.
In 2010, the total intangible assets impairment charge of 41m comprised 30m relating to programme and customer related intangibles, and 11m relating to other intangibles.
The charge impacted the Cyber & Intelligence 11m and Platforms & Services US 30m reporting segments.

Due to changes in UK tax legislation during 2009, there are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on the aggregate temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures 2010 nil.
Any withholding tax due on the remittance of future earnings is expected to be insignificant.
Future changes in tax rates The UK current tax rate was reduced from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
Under the Finance Act 2011, the UK current tax rate will reduce to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
The Chancellor has also proposed changes to further reduce the current tax rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
This will reduce future current tax charges accordingly.
The reduction from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2011.
In line with this change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 27% to 25%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income statement and partly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2011 have been calculated at 25%.
The reduction in the rate from 25% to 23% has not yet been substantively enacted.
If these reductions had been substantively enacted by 31 December 2011, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax asset at that date from 1,383m to 1,307m.
Of this reduction, it is estimated that 8m would have been charged to the consolidated income statement and 68m charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2011 would have been reduced from 140m to 133m.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are defined contribution plans.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries as updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 to assess the deficits of the plans at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2011.
These plans were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2011.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
Financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans UK US 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 % % % % % % Discount rate 4.8 5.5 5.7 5.0 5.5 5.9 Inflation rate 2.9 3.4 3.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4 4.4 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 1.9 3.4 2.3 3.6 2.3 3.7 2 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.0 2.9 2.8 3.4 3.5 Long-term healthcare cost increases 5.3 5.3 5.3 1 The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be 0.5% 2010 1.0% above the Retail Prices Index RPI inflation of 2.9% 2010 3.4%, plus a promotional scale.
2 The assumption for the rate of increase for deferred pensions is 2.0% 2010 2.8% in respect of those schemes which refer to the Consumer Prices Index as the relevant measure and 2.9% 2010 3.4% where RPI is the relevant measure.
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid values of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present values of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and therefore inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
Discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
The inflation assumptions are used to derive the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2011, used the SAPS S1 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the CMI 2010 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
The mortality tables used for the UK pension arrangements have been updated since last year as a result of the formal actuarial valuations carried out on a number of the UK pension arrangements during 2011.
The mortality tables used for the US pension arrangements have also been updated this year, from the RP 2000 tables, to the most recently published tables, the 2012 IRS Static Tables.
The mortality tables are projected to 2018 for pensioners and to 2026 for non-pensioners.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK plans range from 22 to 24 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 24 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65 and, for the main US plans, 19 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 21 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 9.0% in 2012 reducing to 5% by 2020 for pre-retirement and 8.5% in 2012 reducing to 5% by 2019 for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown overleaf.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.

Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups defined benefit plans as well as Airbus SAS, the Groups share of which was disposed of in 2006.
As these plans are multi-employer plans, the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and Airbus SAS based upon a consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.

Such costs are generally incurred within three years postdelivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum but not the timing of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations continuing operations The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
The reorganisation provisions totalling 186m created in 2011 include 60m for which the Group is contractually entitled to reimbursement from the customer.
This amount is included in prepayments and accrued income at 31 December 2011.
Legal, contractual and environmental The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.

Certain provisions of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These provisions include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive Chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Treasury shares During the year, 184,393,049 ordinary shares of 2.5p each were repurchased under the buyback programme 2010 143,951,447.
During 2011, 11,013,823 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the Share Incentive Plan, Share Matching Plan, Performance Share Plan and Executive Share Option Plan 2010 9,526,179 in respect of the Share Incentive Plan and Share Matching Plan.
Own shares held Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems ESOP Trust, are recognised as a deduction from retained earnings.
BAE Systems ESOP Trust The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, to meet commitments to Group employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and November 2011.
The shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation during 2011 and remains over shares within the Companys Share Incentive Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by the participants.
A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and November 2011 over shares in the Group All-Employee Free Shares Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by participants.
Capital The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups capital was 4,291m 2010 5,356m, which comprises total equity of 4,299m 2010 5,403m, less amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of 8m 2010 47m.
Net debt as defined by the Group was 1,439m 2010 242m.
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required.
