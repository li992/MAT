Provisions At Unwind of At 1 January Provisions Provisions provision Provision 31 December 2011 charged released discount utilised 2011 m m m m m m Industrial disease provision 81.7 4.0 2.5 83.2 Other provisions 5.3 3.5 0.4 0.2 8.2 87.0 3.5 0.4 4.0 2.7 91.4 Due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of settlement, all provisions have been classed as non-current.
Other provisions relate to property held provisions, contingent consideration on acquisitions and National Insurance in respect of share options schemes.
There is sufficient uncertainty as to the timing of these obligations to recognise as a provision rather than within creditors.
Industrial disease provision There is a history of asbestos claims being lodged against the Cape Group.
Where the Group has deemed that it is appropriate to do so, settlement has been made.
In order to provide for the long-term financing of future asbestos related claims likely to be made successfully against the Group, in 2006 Cape plc put in place a Scheme of Arrangement, details of which are set out in note 34.
The most recent actuarial review was performed in the prior year.
Management monitor claims received on an ongoing basis and do not note any factors which would require a change to the assumptions or trigger a full actuarial review in the current year.
Due to the nature of this provision there remains uncertainty over the number, nature, timing and validity of future claims which could occur over a period of more than 40 years and the provision will be updated should any material change occur.
However, the Directors anticipate that, assuming no material deterioration in the Groups trading performance, the Group will be able to ensure that i its subsidiary Cape Claims Services Limited will be sufficiently funded to satisfy all Scheme claims and ii the Group will be sufficiently funded to satisfy any UK asbestos-related claims falling outside of the Scheme.
The provision in respect of the industrial disease is discounted at 5% 2010: 5%.
