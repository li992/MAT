General information Britvic plc the company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
It is a public limited company domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Britvic plc and its subsidiaries together the group operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and France.
The operating companies of the group are disclosed within note 32.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 29 November 2011.
Statement of compliance The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, as they apply to the financial statements of the group.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
For further detail, please refer to note 33.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date the group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, in subsequent financial periods the acquisition method of accounting has been used.
Under the acquisition method, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Revenue recognition Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, and after deduction of sales related discounts and rebates, value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Sales-related discounts are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet claims by the groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Vehicles included in plant and machinery 5 to 7 years Equipment in retail outlets included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 to 10 years Other fixtures and fittings included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 10 years Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual amounts are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Goodwill Business combinations on or after 4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies by management.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the assets useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Software Costs Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
Impairment of assets The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior managements estimate of the cost of capital.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Goodwill impairment losses cannot subsequently be reversed.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 61 financial stat ements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables The group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs.
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
Net investment hedges Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the groups net investment in foreign operations.
Some of the groups foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances.
The effective portion of gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the income statement.
Fair value hedges Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate.
The fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the income statement.
Accounting policies continued Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights to the cash flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, provisions for share-based payments and employee profit share schemes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension schemes.
These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Plan assets are measured at fair value based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities, the published bid price.
Plan liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities.
The movement in the defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet consists of four main elements.
The service cost of providing pension benefits to employees for the period which is recognised in the income statement.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the plan liabilities during the year which is included within administrative expenses.
A credit representing the expected return on the plan assets during the year which is included within administrative expenses.
This credit is based on the market value of the plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the beginning of the period.
These may result from: differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets: differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan liabilities and actual experience during the year: or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 63 financial stat ements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Pensions and post retirement benefits continued Changes to benefits under a defined benefit plan are accounted for as follows: Past service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from changes to post-employment benefits.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for part or all of the benefits already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the period are charged to the income statement as an operating expense.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses and paid annual leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the group.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the group.
Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Any lease incentives received are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance cost.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling.
The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the same as the functional currency of the company.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement other than those differences relating to financial instruments designated as part of a net investment hedge.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit and loss.
Foreign operations The income statement and statement of cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period.
The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on opening net assets and arising on the translation of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the company.
Accounting policies continued Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Nature and purpose of other reserves Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the excess of proceeds over the nominal value on the issue of shares.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve is used to record purchases by the group of its own shares, which will be distributed to employees as and when share awards made under the Britvic employee share plans vest.
Share scheme reserve The share scheme reserve is used to record the movements in equity corresponding to the cost recognised in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Amounts recognised in the share scheme reserve are transferred to retained losses upon subsequent settlement of any awards that vest either by issue or purchase of the groups shares, or when awards lapse.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve records the effective portion of movements in the fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate and cross currency swaps that have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.
Translation reserve The translation reserve includes cumulative net exchange differences on translation into the presentational currency sterling of items recorded in group entities with a non-sterling functional currency net of amounts recognised in respect of net investment hedges.
Merger reserve The movement on the merger reserve during the period ended 3 October 2010 was the result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010.
It was executed using a structure which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.
Exceptional and other items The group presents items as exceptional and other items on the face of the income statement to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Exceptional items include those significant items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
Other items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied.
These items have been included within exceptional and other items because they are non-cash and do not form part of how management assesses performance.
Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Post-retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
These key assumptions are disclosed in note 24.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Further details are given in note 16.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require managements judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The group recognises deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable that the benefit will be realised.
Further details are given in note 10.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 65 financial stat ements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty continued Cross currency interest rate swaps The group measures cross currency interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract rate and the relevant exchange interest rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date.
The calculation therefore uses estimates of present value, future foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Information regarding cross currency interest rate swaps is provided in notes 23 and 27.
Other The group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments.
However, the value of this item is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Further details are given in note 29.
New standards adopted in the current period During the period, the group adopted a number of interpretations and amendments to standards which had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the group.
New standards and interpretations not applied The group has not applied the following IFRSs, which may be applicable to the group, that have been issued but are not yet effective: Effective date periods commencing on or after International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS 7 Amendment to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of financial assets 1 July 2011 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013 International Accounting Standards IAS IAS 1 Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements 1 July 2012 IAS 12 Amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes 1 January 2012 IAS 19 IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 24 Amendment to IAS 24 Disclosure requirements for government related 1 January 2011 entities and definition of a related party IAS 27 IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements 1 January 2013 IAS 28 IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2013 IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 14 Amendment Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement 1 January 2011 IFRIC 20 Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine 1 January 2013 Other Annual improvements Annual improvements 2010 1 January 2011 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the groups reported income or net assets in the period, with the exception of IAS 19 revised which is not anticipated to have a material impact on net assets, but the impact on the reported income of the group is not possible to determine as it will depend on conditions at the time of adoption.
The most significant change for Britvic under IAS 19 revised is the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a finance cost component which is determined by applying the same discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The difference between the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate will be presented in other comprehensive income.
The effect at the date of adoption will depend on market interest rates, rates of return and the actual mix of scheme assets at that time.
Following consultation with GB employees, the group principal pension scheme, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, was closed to future accrual for active members with effect from 10 April 2011 and the intention of the Trustees is to change the asset allocation over time to reduce the risk of volatility within the asset portfolio.
Changes to the mix of scheme assets to reduce risk may also reduce the impact of IAS 19 revised.
Segmental reporting For management purposes, the group is organised into business units and has five reportable segments as follows: GB Stills United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland GB Carbs United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland International Ireland France These business units sell soft drinks into their respective markets.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on brand contribution.
This is defined as revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Such costs include brand specific advertising and promotion costs, raw materials and marginal production and distribution costs.
However, group financing including finance costs and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.
Transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

b In 2010, asset impairments can be analysed as follows: Impairments of goodwill in the GB segment Red Devil 5.0m, Orchid 6.4m Impairments of intangible assets in the Ireland segment 89.6m Impairments of land and buildings in the Ireland segment 14.6m, 0.5m relates to assets previously held for sale Impairments of plant and equipment in the GB segment 0.5m In respect of tangible fixed assets, all impairments were calculated based on fair value less costs to sell, where the fair value is determined by reference to an active market.
c In 2010, costs relating to the purchase and integration of Britvic France were primarily Advisors fees.
d Restructuring costs includes the costs of major restructuring programmes undertaken.
The 2011 costs principally relate to: Redundancy costs arising in the Ireland segment: Redundancy and restructuring costs relating to the separation of functional support structures between group and the GB business unit: Costs relating to the outsourcing of the group data centre involving dual running and temporary infrastructure cost: and The outsourcing of our GB full service vending operation.
This includes exit and redundancy costs and a write down of the associated assets.
Exceptional and other items continued The 2010 costs related to: Redundancy costs arising in the Ireland segment: and Costs in relation to the Business Transformation project in the Ireland segment.
e Head office relocation relates to costs associated with the transfer of the Britvic head office from Chelmsford to Hemel Hempstead which is proposed to take place in 2012.
The 2011 cost principally relates to a dilapidations provision and lease break fee in respect of the existing office in Chelmsford.
f In 2010, the onerous leases related to two sites within the Ireland business segment where, in addition to accruals made in previous years, incremental future lease commitments were accrued for based on our experience of the deterioration in the Irish property market during 2009 10. g Following the successful refinancing of the groups committed bank facility in March 2011 see note 23, the unamortised 2009 refinancing fees of 1.5m have been written off to finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
h Other fair value movements relate to the fair value movement of derivative financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied.

No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.
The group expects that future remittances of earnings from its overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption and so the un-remitted earnings of these subsidiaries are not disclosed above.
A deferred tax asset of 0.2m 2010: nil has not been recognised in respect of tax losses.
The tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise the benefits therefrom.
T axation continued d Impact of rate change The main rate of UK Corporation tax was reduced to 26% from 1 April 2011.
The Finance Act 2011 further reduced the main rate of UK Corporation tax to 25% from 1 April 2012.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 0.4m, comprising a credit of 1.2m to the Consolidated Income Statement and a charge of 0.8m to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Additional changes to the main rate of UK Corporation Tax are proposed, to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the UK net deferred tax liability by 0.6m.
On 7 November 2011, the French government announced a proposal to apply a temporary two year 5% surcharge to the corporate tax liabilities of French companies whose turnover exceeds 250m.
This change was only announced after the period end and consequently has not been included in these financial statements.
The effect of this proposed increase would be to increase the Britvic France net deferred tax liability by 0.6m.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2011 2010 m m Basic earnings per share Profit loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders 58.4 48.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for basic earnings per share 240.4 224.9 Basic earnings per share 24.3p 21.4p Diluted earnings per share Profit loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders 58.4 48.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for diluted earnings per share 246.4 231.8 Diluted earnings per share 23.7p 21.4p The diluted earnings per share is unchanged from the basic earnings per share, as the inclusion of the dilutive ordinary shares would reduce the loss per share and is therefore not dilutive in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
The group presents as exceptional and other items on the face of the Income Statement, those significant items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance more readily.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis with the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets also added back using the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table below: 2011 2010 Restated m m Adjusted basic earnings per share Profit loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders 58.4 48.2 Add: Net impact of exceptional and other items 19.5 128.2 Add: Intangible assets amortisation acquisition related 3.1 2.2 81.0 82.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for basic earnings per share 240.4 224.9 Adjusted basic earnings per share 33.7p 36.5p Adjusted diluted earnings per share Profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders before exceptional items and other items and acquisition related intangible assets amortisation 81.0 82.2 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for diluted earnings per share 246.4 231.8 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 32.9p 35.5p The add back of amortisation of intangible assets was previously stated on a total basis.
In order to better reflect the ongoing underlying earnings, only acquisition related amortisation is now adjusted and comparatives have been restated accordingly.

During the period, properties with a net book value of 26.6m, comprising freehold land and buildings of 21.4m and leasehold land and buildings of 5.2m, were transferred to Britvic Property Partnership see note 24.
These secure the future income stream to the pension plan.
Finance leases The net book value of freehold land and buildings and plant and machinery includes 0.3m and 0.5m respectively 2010: 0.5m and 0.9m respectively in respect of assets held under finance leases.

Trademarks Britvic Ireland and Britvic France Trademarks represent those trade names acquired which the group plans to maintain.
All trademarks have been allocated an indefinite life by management.
A list of the trademarks held in respect of the Britvic Ireland and Britvic France segments is shown in note 16.
It is expected, and in line with existing well-established trademarks within the group, that the trademarks with indefinite lives in respect of Britvic France and Britvic Ireland will be held and supported for an indefinite period of time and are expected to generate economic benefits.
The group is committed to supporting its trademarks by investing in significant consumer marketing promotional spend.
Franchise rights Franchise rights represent the franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provide the long-term right to distribute certain soft drinks.
These agreements have been allocated a 35 year useful economic life.
As at 2 October 2011 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 31 years.
The franchise agreement itself has a contract life less than the useful economic life.
The useful economic life has been determined on the basis that the renewal of the contract is highly probable.
Intangible assets continued Customer lists Britvic France Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of Britvic France relate to those customer relationships acquired.
These intangible assets have been allocated useful economic lives of 20 years.
At 2 October 2011 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 19 years.
Britvic Ireland Customer lists represent those customer relationships acquired which are valued in respect of the grocery and wholesale businesses.
These customer lists have been allocated useful economic lives of between 10 and 20 years.
At 2 October 2011 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of between 6 and 16 years.
Software costs Software is capitalised at cost.
These intangible assets have been assessed as having finite lives and are amortised using the straight-line method over a period of 3 to 7 years.
These assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment arises.
As at 2 October 2011 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of up to 6 years.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised.
Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Further detail is provided in note 16.
Intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Britvic Ireland and Britvic France are valued in euros and translated to sterling at the reporting date.
15. Business combinations There were no material acquisitions during the period.
Acquisition of Britvic France On 28 May 2010, the group acquired Britvic France for a cash consideration of 186.4m translated at 160.5m at the time of acquisition.
The initial fair value acquisition accounting for Britvic France was determined provisionally in the financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 3 October 2010.
The fair value adjustments have now been finalised and are shown in the table below.
The overall impact of the changes made result in an increase to goodwill of 1.0m.
The comparatives for the 53 weeks ended 3 October 2010 have been adjusted in these financial statements to reflect these updated fair values accordingly.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the favourable market presence which Britvic France enjoys, an assembled workforce and anticipated future operating synergies from the combination.

The Britvic Ireland and Britvic France goodwill is valued in euros and translated at the reporting date.
Apart from a 0.4m increase in goodwill in Ireland relating to the non-material acquisition of Quinns of Cookstown, there are no movements from the prior year other than translation movements.
Trademarks with indefinite lives Carrying amount of trademarks with indefinite lives in the Ireland segment As part of the fair value exercise regarding the 2007 acquisition of Britvic Ireland, certain trademarks with indefinite lives were recognised.
These trademarks have been allocated by senior management to five individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as follows: Britvic Cidona Mi Wadi Ballygowan Club m m m m m At 2 October 2011 6.4 5.7 8.8 2.4 14.6 At 3 October 2010 6.5 5.8 8.9 2.5 14.8 The trademarks are valued in euros and translated at the reporting date.
The movements in the carrying amount from the prior year relate only to translation movements.
Carrying amount of trademarks with indefinite lives in the France segment Additional trademarks with indefinite lives were recognised as part of the fair value exercise on the 2010 acquisition of Britvic France.
These trademarks have been allocated by senior management to four individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as follows: Moulin fide Teisseire Valdonne Pressade Fruit m m m m At 2 October 2011 49.1 4.0 4.6 4.3 At 3 October 2010 49.9 4.1 4.7 4.4 The trademarks are valued in euros and translated at the reporting date.
The movements in the carrying amount from the prior year only relate to translation movements.
Impairment testing of intangible assets continued Method of impairment testing The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the cash-generating units detailed above has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
To calculate this, 20 year cash flow projections are based on financial budgets prepared by senior management and approved by the board of directors.
A 20 year cash flow period has been used reflecting the current economic uncertainty in the markets in which we operate.
The group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to pre-tax cash flow projections is 11% 2010: 11 per cent for goodwill relating to Britvic GB.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2010: 10 per cent was applied for the Britvic Ireland goodwill and trademarks recognised on the acquisition of Britvic Ireland.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% was applied for the Britvic France goodwill and trademarks recognised on the acquisition of Britvic France.
Cash flows beyond a one year period are extrapolated based on senior management forecasts for the following four years and beyond that based on growth and inflationary assumptions as described below.
No growth besides inflationary growth increases is assumed beyond five years given the current economic uncertainty.
Senior management expectations are formed in line with performance to date and experience, as well as available external market data.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculation The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill.
Growth rates reflect senior management expectations of volume growth based on growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected market trends.
Discount rates reflect senior managements estimate of the pre-tax cost of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the different risks of different countries in which the group operates.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Marginal contribution being revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Marginal contribution is based on financial budgets approved by the Britvic plc board.
Key assumptions are made within these budgets about pricing, discounts and costs based on historical data, current strategy and expected market trends.
Advertising and promotional spend financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising and promotional spend.
This is based on the planned spend for year one and strategic intent thereafter.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation the basis used to determine the value assigned to inflation is the forecast increase in consumer price indices in the relevant market.
This has been used in all value in use calculations performed.
Conclusions In 2010, impairment losses were recognised in respect of Red Devil goodwill 5.0m, Orchid goodwill 6.4m, Britvic Ireland goodwill 54.7m, Britvic Ireland indefinite life trademarks 29.7m and Britvic Ireland finite life trademarks 0.1m.
No further impairments have been identified during 2011 and for all cash-generating units, with the exception of Orchid, there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions other than a further, currently unforecast, material decline in the prospects for the economies in which the group operates, which would cause the value of the goodwill or any of the intangible assets with indefinite lives to materially fall short of their carrying value.
For the Orchid cash generating unit, no growth has been assumed in the cash flow projections.
Based on this assumption, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by approximately 0.7m.
A decline in volumes of 2% per annum in the five year forecasts used would reduce this to nil.
Intangible assets with finite lives Franchise rights Franchise rights represent the franchise agreements acquired, as a result of the acquisition of Britvic Ireland, which provide the long-term right to distribute certain soft drinks.
Management have reviewed the performance of those products since acquisition and no indicators of impairment have been identified.
Customer lists As part of the fair value exercise regarding the acquisitions of Britvic Ireland in 2007 and Britvic France in 2010, customer list assets with finite lives were recognised.
Management have reviewed trading levels with those customers since acquisition and in the prior year identified a number of material reductions which have been directly attributed to the difficult trading conditions experienced in Ireland due to the sustained economic downturn.
As a result an impairment loss of 5.1m was recognised in 2010.
No indicators of impairment have been identified in the current year and accordingly no further impairments have been recognised in respect of customer lists.
Recognition of impairment losses In 2010, impairment losses, in respect of intangible assets as detailed above, totalling 101.0m were recognised in the income statement within exceptional administration expenses.
11.4m related to the GB carbs business segment and 89.6m related to the Britvic Ireland business segment.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued Bank loans In March 2011, the group reached agreement with its banks to refinance 333m of existing bank facilities which were due to mature in May 2012.
The previous 3 year facility has been replaced with a new six-bank 400m revolving multi-currency 5 year facility which will mature in March 2016.
The unsecured bank loans classified as non-current are repayable in December 2012 and 2018 2010: May 2012.
Loans outstanding at 2 October 2011 attract interest at an average rate of 5.09% for euro denominated loans 2010: 3.04%.

Private placement notes 2007 Notes On 20 February 2007, Britvic plc issued US$375m and 38m of Senior Notes the 2007 Notes in the United States Private Placement market.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay and cancel a 150m term loan, with the remainder being used to repay the amounts drawn on the groups revolving credit facility.
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the Notes are shown in the table below: Series Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest A 7 year 20 February 2014 US$87m US$ fixed at 5.80% UK fixed at 6.10% B 7 year 20 February 2014 US$15m US$ LIBOR 0.5% UK fixed at 6.07% C 7 year 20 February 2014 25m UK fixed at 6.11% n a D 10 year 20 February 2017 US$147m US$ fixed at 5.90% UK fixed at 5.98% E 12 year 20 February 2019 US$126m US$ fixed at 6.00% UK fixed at 5.98% F 12 year 20 February 2019 13m UK fixed at 5.94% n a Britvic plc makes quarterly and semi-annual interest payments in the currency of issue.
The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the company.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, the group has entered into currency interest rate swaps whereby fixed floating US dollar interest is swapped for fixed sterling interest.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings which they hedge and are designated as part of effective hedge relationships see note 27.
Covenants on these Notes include a term which states that Britvic plc must offer to repay the Notes should a change in control of the group occur which results in a downwards movement in the credit rating as defined in the Note purchase agreement.
2009 Notes On 17 December 2009, Britvic plc issued US$250m of Senior Notes in the United States Private Placement market the 2009 Notes.
The 2009 Notes are additional borrowings to the 2007 Notes.
The proceeds from the 2009 Notes were principally used to repay amounts drawn on the groups existing borrowings, including the repayment of 100m of the revolving credit facility.
Britvic plc makes semi-annual interest payments in US dollars, with the first payment being made on 17 June 2010.
The 2009 Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and to ensure an appropriate mix of sterling and euro funding, the group has entered into a number of new cross currency interest rate swaps.
The 2009 Notes were swapped into floating rate sterling and euro liabilities through a series of US dollar to sterling and sterling to euro swap instruments.
These cross currency interest rate swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the relevant borrowings they hedge and are designated as part of effective hedge relationships see note 27.

To mitigate exposure to changes in euro interest rates on this liability, 75.0m of interest rate swaps were transacted.
These swaps do not form part of an effective hedge relationship.

Pensions The group principal pension scheme for GB employees, the Britvic Pension Plan BPP, has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the BPP was closed to new members on 1 August 2002, and following consultation with GB employees was closed to future accrual for active members with effect from 10 April 2011, with members moving into the defined contribution section for future service benefits.
Contributions are paid into the Plan in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary and as outlined in the Schedule of Contributions.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
Following the conclusion of the previous triennial valuation, the final annual payment of 10m contributions in respect of the funding shortfall, outlined in the recovery plan, was made by 31 December 2010.
As a result of the latest formal valuation, a proposal was set out under which a monetary contribution or contributions will be made to enable the Trustee of the BPP to acquire an interest in a limited partnership.
This partnership interest is intended to provide the Trustee with an income of at least 5m per annum in each year over a 15 year period together with a final payment of up to a maximum of 105m to the extent required under funding conditions to be agreed to the satisfaction of the Trustee and the company, at the end of the 15 year period.
A first tranche of this proposal was completed prior to the period end.
Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership Britvic SLP and Britvic Property Partnership Britvic PP were established by the group and properties with a market value of 28.6m were then transferred to Britvic PP and leased back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited.
Britvic SLP holds an investment in Britvic PP.
The BPP is a partner in Britvic SLP and is entitled to a share of the profits of the partnership over the next 15 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to any funding deficit of the BPP at that time, up to a maximum value of 25m.
At that point the group may be required to transfer this amount in cash to the BPP.
Both Britvic SLP and Britvic PP are consolidated by the group.
The investment held by the BPP in Britvic SLP does not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair value of plan assets.
The share of profits of Britvic SLP received by the BPP will be accounted for by the group as contributions when paid.
The properties transferred to Britvic PP continue to be included within the groups property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and the group retains operational flexibility over the transferred properties, including the ability to substitute the properties held by Britvic PP.
In addition to the expected partnership income of at least 5m per annum, the group will make payments to the BPP of 5m by 31 December 2011, 7.5m by 31 December 2012 and 15m per annum by 31 December of each year from 2013 to 2017.
In the event that further tranches of the proposal do not proceed, the BPP will instead receive total contributions of 10m by 31 December 2011, 12.5m by 31 December 2012 and 20m per annum by 31 December of each year from 2013 to 2022 inclusive.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the income statement for 2011 was 5.8m 2010: 3.6m.
Pensions continued In Northern Ireland, the Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
Employees of C&C Group transferred out of BNIPP on 30 June 2008 with the bulk transfer of assets for the C&C employees taking place in December 2009.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2008 and as a result shortfall correction additional contributions of 90,000 per month until 31 December 2010, and 125,000 per month from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019 are being paid in accordance with the Recovery Plan dated December 2009.
In the Republic of Ireland, employees continued to participate in a number of C&C Group pension schemes following the acquisition until transferring into two newly formed pension plans called the Britvic Ireland Defined Contribution Pension Plan and the Britvic Ireland Defined Benefit Pension Plan BIPP on 1 September 2008.
Since 1 March 2006 new employees have been offered membership of the defined contribution plan in the first instance, with the ability to transfer into the defined benefit plan for future service benefits after a period of 5 years.
The first formal actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 December 2009 and is still being finalised.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the Income Statement for 2011 was 0.6m 2010: 0.4m.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups finances.
The assets and liabilities of the pension schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 2 October 2011 by Towers Watson BPP and Mercer BIPP and BNIPP.
Included within the pension liability on the consolidated balance sheet is an accrual of 1.4m 2010: 1.1m for retirement indemnities in respect of Britvic France.
This liability is considered to be immaterial and no further disclosure is included within this note.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate on assets assumption for the portfolio.
Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables, which for the BPP are known as SAPS Series 1.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 years years years years years years ROI NI GB ROI NI GB Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.7 20.9 22.0 22.7 20.9 21.9 Current pensioners at age 65 females 24.4 23.7 24.5 24.4 23.7 24.2 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 25.6 22.7 24.2 25.6 22.6 24.1 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 26.7 25.2 26.9 26.7 25.1 26.6 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2010 following a mortality analysis carried out as part of the actuarial valuation of the Britvic Pension Plan at 31 March 2010.

Pensions continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

The ROI curtailment gain in the year was triggered by the redundancies of employees resulting in a significant number of members moving from active to deferred status in the period, thereby no longer accruing future entitlement.
The GB curtailment gain in the year arose due to the closure to future accrual of the defined benefit section of the GB plan.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 19 and 25 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The board of directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The groups policy is to have an average over the next three years of between 25% and 80% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
To manage this, the group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 2 October 2011, after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 82% of the groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2010: 63%.

The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Non functional currency purchases and interest costs are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 2 October 2011, the group has hedged 67% 2010: 68% of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash flows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties.
It is the groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 19.
For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the Head of Finance Shared Services.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch.
The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, steel and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Share schemes equity price risk The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan.
To hedge this risk the group has entered into a number of total return share swaps against schemes maturing in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of the share swaps.
Increase Effect on decrease in profit before share price tax % m 2011 10 1.9 10 1.9 2010 10 2.2 10 2.2 Liquidity risk The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The objective of the groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long-term private placement issuance.
The bank loans entered into by the group are unsecured.
At 2 October 2011, none of the groups debt will mature in less than one year 2010: none.

Details with regard to derivative contracts are included in note 27.
Fair value hierarchy The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Capital management The group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the group balances returns to shareholders between long-term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio.
Adjusted net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the US private placement Notes.
Adjusted net debt is shown in note 30.
The adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The group believes that an adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio in the range of 2.0 3.0 provides an efficient capital structure and an appropriate level of financial flexibility.
At 2 October 2011 the adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio was 2.4 2010: 2.4.

Non-derivative financial liabilities are all carried at amortised cost.
The fair value of derivatives, which are quoted at market price, has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and payables approximate to book value.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings has been derived from the sum of future cash flows to maturity discounted back to present values at a market rate.

Derivatives and hedge relationships continued Derivatives not designated as part of hedge relationships Interest rate swaps The 2009 USPP cross currency swaps converted an amount of US dollar borrowings into a 147.0m floating rate euro liability.
These 5-year fixed rate swaps had an effective start date of December 2010.
From the 2010 USPP issuance an amount of $55m was swapped into 35.6m of floating rate sterling liability.
To mitigate exposure for a proportion of this liability, 20m of 3-year interest rate swaps were transacted with an effective date of December 2011.
Forward rate agreement To mitigate exposure to floating interest rates at the next interest rate fixing on the remaining 72m of 2009 floating rate euro liability, a series of forward rate agreements with a notional totalling 70m were transacted with an effective date of December 2011.
Share swaps The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
Foreign exchange swaps As part of operational cash management 108m of euro sterling FX swaps were in existence at 2 October 2011.

Derivatives and hedge relationships continued As at the 2 October 2011 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows: Cash flow hedges Forward currency contracts At 2 October 2011, the group held 72 2010: 60 US dollar and 51 2010: 30 euro forward exchange contracts the forward currency contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars and euros which the group believe to be highly probable transactions.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these highly probable transactions.
The forward currency contracts hedge the expected future purchases in the period to 30 September 2012 and have been assessed as part of effective cash flow hedge relationships.
At the period end there is a net unrealised gain of 1.5m 2010: net unrealised loss of 0.6m, with a related deferred tax liability of 0.4m 2009: related deferred tax asset of 0.1m, which has been included in equity in respect of these contacts.

All of that expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
No of shares 2011 2010 Annual free shares award 484,343 406,083 Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 346,267 287,132 Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 97 financial stat ements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Share-based payments continued The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% per annum over a three year period in excess of the average growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2010: 25% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the Ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the period.
Number Weighted average of share exercise price options pence Outstanding as at 27 September 2009 6,564,530 251.8 Granted during the period 1,785,576 387.0 Exercised during the period 639,946 245.0 Forfeited during the period 162,077 285.1 Outstanding as at 3 October 2010 7,548,083 283.7 Granted during the period 1,566,418 464.6 Exercised during the period 209,531 265.8 Forfeited during the period 140,584 392.4 Outstanding at 2 October 2011 8,764,386 314.8 Exercisable at 2 October 2011 2,923,260 281.1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 459.3p 2010: 412.7p.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 82.8p 2010: 81.6p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used in respect of the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2011.
The comparative shows the inputs to the model used in respect of the award granted during the 53 weeks ended 3 October 2010.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards up to and including 2008 were made in respect of ordinary shares.
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 were made in respect of nil cost options.
Nil cost options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance conditions and remain exercisable until 10 years 7 years after the date of grant for employees based in the UK Ireland respectively.
The performance condition applying to the total number of awards granted to members of the senior leadership team during the current period is divided equally between the total shareholder return TSR and return on invested capital ROIC performance conditions described below.
The TSR condition measures the companys TSR relative to a comparator group consisting of 22 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 25% 2010: 25% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
For the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2011, the ROIC performance condition requires the companys ROIC to be at least 22.7% 2010: for the award granted during the 53 weeks ended 3 October 2010, 23.2% over the three year performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 21.9% 2010: 21.9% over the performance period, 25% 2010: 25% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team vest subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2010: 25% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
The following tables illustrate the movements in the number of shares and nil cost options during the period.
