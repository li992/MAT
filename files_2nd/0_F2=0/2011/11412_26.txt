Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, instead these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.

4.3 Financial instruments Accounting policies financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
the Company classifies its financial instruments into available-for-sale, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.
management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Offsetting financial instruments financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
1 Fair value of financial instruments set out below is a comparison by category of carrying values and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, the short-term investment, receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are included in the analysis below.

2 Credit risk the Companys exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, a short-term investment and other receivables excluding prepayments.
Exposure to credit risk the carrying value of financial assets, as set out in note 4.3.
1, represents the maximum credit exposure.
no collateral is held as security against these assets.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment the Companys exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and the short-term investments is managed by investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk in light of the current economic climate.
the Companys guideline is to maintain transactional bank accounts and term deposits with financial institutions which carry a moodys rating of aa3 p1 for long-term and short-term deposits.
Other receivables Other receivables at the end of both periods consist primarily of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
management provides for irrecoverable debts when there are indicators that a balance may not be recoverable.
the ageing of other receivables excluding prepayments and the short-term investment at the balance sheet date is set out below: 27 November 2011 28 november 2010 Gross Impairment gross impairment notes 000 000 000 000 not past due 137,952 91,244 past due 03 months past due 36 months past due over 6 months 3.2.
1 137,952 91,244 there were no unimpaired balances at the period end where the Company had renegotiated the terms of the other receivables.
management has not provided for irrecoverable debts against any of its other receivable balances.
3 Liquidity risk to manage the working capital needs of the business, the Company is reliant on being able to negotiate sufficient financing arrangements.
the Company monitors cash flow as part of its day-to-day control procedures and the board considers cash flow projections on a monthly basis.
for further details on the groups capital management strategy see note 4.8 in the consolidated financial statements.

4 Market risk Currency risk the Company engages in foreign currency transactions to a very limited extent.
no financial assets are held in foreign currencies.
due to the Companys lack of exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest rate risk the Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities, and its interest bearing financial assets consists of only cash and cash equivalents including a short-term investment in the prior period.
these financial assets are exposed to interest rate risk as the Company holds money market deposits at floating interest rates.
the risk is managed by investing cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with uK banks split between fixed term deposits, notice accounts and money market funds.
at the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Companys interest bearing financial instruments was: 27 November 28 november 2011 2010 000 000 Fixed rate instruments financial assets 37,127 70,000 Variable rate instruments financial assets 48,203 74,361 Sensitivity analysis an increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
a rate of 100 basis points was deemed appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
this calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
this analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.
