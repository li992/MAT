The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates, and the items discussed below have reached litigation.
The Group holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise, however, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Groups overall profitability and cash flows in future periods.
On 22 July 2010 Vodafone reached agreement with the UK tax authorities with respect to the UK Controlled Foreign Company CFC tax case.
Vodafone will pay 1.25 billion to settle all outstanding CFC issues from 2001 to date and has also reached agreement that no further UK CFC tax liabilities will arise in the near future under current legislation.
Longer term, no CFC liabilities are expected to arise as a consequence of the likely reforms of the UK CFC regime due to the facts established in this agreement.
A Spanish subsidiary, Vodafone Holdings Europe SL VHESL, has resolved its dispute with the Spanish tax authorities regarding the tax treatment of interest expenses claimed in the accounting periods ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004.
