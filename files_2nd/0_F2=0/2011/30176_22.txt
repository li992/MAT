Signi cant accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year.
a Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
At acquisition, the cost of investment in a subsidiary is measured at the fair value of the consideration payable, except for subsidiaries acquired through the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief where cost is measured by reference to the nominal value of the shares issued.
b Taxation Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable pro ts and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Signi cant accounting policies continued c Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 IFRS 2 Share-based payment and UITF Abstract 44 IFRIC Interpretation 11 FRS 20 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The Company has share-based payment arrangements involving employees of its subsidiaries.
The cost of these arrangements is measured by reference to the fair value of equity instruments on the date they are granted.
Cost is recognised in investment in subsidiary undertakings and credited to the pro t and loss account reserves on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Where the cost is subsequently recharged to the subsidiary, it is recognised as a reduction in investment in subsidiary undertakings.
d Financial assets and financial liabilities The Company has adopted FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation, FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial assets are classi ed on initial recognition as loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are classi ed on initial recognition as other financial liabilities.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments that have xed or determinable payments that are not listed in an active market.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash ows of the investment have been impacted.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement.
