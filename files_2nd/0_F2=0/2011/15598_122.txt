The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions, which are exercisable if an existing option to buy back leased assets at market value at a specified date is also exercised, no commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Groups discretion.
The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date, therefore minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.
Operating lease commitments with joint ventures Since 1988 the Group has entered into several joint ventures and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures.
The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value: options within the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value: market rent reviews: and 20 to 30 full-year lease terms.
The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when determining the classification of leases as operating or finance: all of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases.
Operating lease receivables Group as lessor The Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases.
At the balance sheet date, the following future minimum lease payments are contractually receivable from tenants: 2011 2010 m m Within one year 286 259 Greater than one year but less than five years 537 566 After five years 306 348 Total minimum lease payments 1,129 1,173 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 145
