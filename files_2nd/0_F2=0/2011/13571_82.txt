84 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.

Energy d evelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and electrical power generation and aftermarket services.
Technology and operations, discussed in the business review, operate on a Group-wide basis across all the above segments.
The equity accounted share of the Engine Holding GmbH business acquired during the year is shown separately.
The operating results reviewed by the Board are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic substance of the Groups trading during the year.
The principles adopted to determine underlying results are: Underlying revenue Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
There is no inter-segment trading and hence all revenue is from external customers.
Underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts.
In addition, adjustments have also been made to exclude one-off past-service credits on post-retirement schemes and the effect of acquisition accounting.
Underlying profit before taxation In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: Includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts.
Excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes in value of financial RRSP contracts arising from changes in forecast payments and the net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.

2 Unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts include those included in equity accounted joint ventures and exclude those for which the related trading contracts have been cancelled when the fair value changes are recognised immediately in underlying profit.
3 The adjustment eliminates charges recognised as a result of recognising assets in acquired businesses at fair value.
4 In 2010, the UK Government announced changes to the basis of the statutory indexation for pension increases.
As a result, the relevant arrangements have been amended, resulting in a gain in the income statement of 130m, which has been excluded from underlying profit.
5 The Group has agreed revised post-retirement healthcare arrangements on certain of its overseas schemes.
This has resulted in a net gain in the income statement of 34m which has been excluded from underlying profit.
The reconciliation of underlying earnings per ordinary share is shown in note 5.
