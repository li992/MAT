Notes to the Accounts 1 Segment reporting The Groups management committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
The management committee reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The management committee has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective.
This has led to the operating segments identified in the table below.
The performance of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross profit before exceptional items.
Exceptional items are reported separately in note 5.
12 months ended 29 January 2011 Still drinks Carbonates and water Other Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 172,316 49,420 630 222,366 Gross profit before exceptional items 98,932 15,235 543 114,710 12 months ended 30 January 2010 Still drinks Carbonates and water Other Total 000 000 000 000 Total revenue 155,706 45,168 536 201,410 Gross profit before exceptional items 88,867 13,931 459 103,257 There are no inter-segment sales.
All revenue is from external customers.
Other segments represent income from water coolers for the Findlays 19 litre water business, rental income for vending machines and other soft drink related items such as water cups.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is noted before exceptional costs as the dual running exceptional costs allocated to cost of sales in the income statement relate to both Carbonates and Still drinks and water.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total profit before income tax, as shown in the consolidated income statement.
All of the assets and liabilities of the Group are managed by the management committee on a central basis rather than at a segment level.
As a result, no reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to the statement of financial position has been disclosed for any of the periods presented.
Each of the following items are included in the reportable segments results and balances, and no adjustments are required in arriving at the costs included in the consolidated primary statements: 2011 2010 000 000 Capital expenditure 9,840 5,358 Depreciation and amortisation 7,717 7,885 Impairment of intangible assets 1,084 Impairment of plant and equipment 1,031 Impairment of assets classified as held for sale 464 Capital expenditure comprises cash additions to property, plant and equipment note 11.
All of the segments included within Carbonates and Still drinks and water meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
82 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Geographical information The Group operates predominately in the U. K. with some worldwide sales.

Previously, elements of the Rest of the world revenue totalling 958,000 had been included within U. K. revenue, and this has been restated this year to give a revised Rest of the world figure of 2,971,000 for the year to 30 January 2010.
All of the assets of the Group are located in the U. K. Major customers No single customer accounts for 10% or more of the Groups revenue in either of the periods presented.
2 Profit before tax The following items have been included in arriving at profit before tax: 2011 2010 000 000 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 7,325 7,494 Profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 6 35 Impairment of assets classified as held for sale 464 Fair value movements in financial instruments 192 6 Foreign exchange losses recognised 199 237 Research and development costs 614 437 Impairment of inventories 464 34 Amortisation of intangible assets 392 391 Impairment of intangible assets 1,084 Cost of inventories charged in cost of sales 107,987 98,153 Government grants released 4 68 Operating lease rentals payable property 555 307 Operating lease rentals payable motor vehicles 468 18 Operating lease rentals receivable property 13 Trade receivables impairment net reversal 221 91 Share-based payment costs 956 763 Included within Administration costs is the auditors remuneration, including expenses for audit and non-audit services.

The Mansfield production site includes a distribution operation.
A third party distribution company has taken over the distribution operations and as there is an element of dual running over the period of Mansfield closure, these dual running costs have been classified as exceptional.
In house distribution operations at Mansfield are expected to cease in the first quarter of 2011.
In addition, a further 103,000 of dual running costs have been treated as exceptional within operating expenses.
These costs represent payments to a third party for the setting up of the distribution site.
Following the decision to cease production of the Vitsmart and Taut branded products in the year, an impairment charge has been recognised in respect of both of these.
Further details of the impairment are detailed in note 10.
In addition, the water rights A. G. BARR p. l. c. holds for the use of the spring for Findlays water were written down to the recoverable value of 1.
The impairment arose following declining volumes in the sales of Findlays water.
In the year to 29 January 2011, 136,000 of redundancy costs were incurred in relation to the Group reorganisation following the acquisition of Groupe Rubicon on 29 August 2008.
In the year to 30 January 2010, costs of 84,000 were incurred.
66,000 of environmental obligations were included as exceptional costs for the year to 30 January 2010, relating to work that must be completed before the Group can leave the Mansfield site.
This is anticipated to be incurred in the first quarter of 2011, when the site is expected to close.
As part of the closure plans for the Mansfield site, a review was carried out during the year to 30 January 2010 of the plant and equipment held at the site.
Plant and equipment was identified as having a net book value in excess of its recoverable amount.
This resulted in a provision being made for 998,000 to reduce the plant and equipment to its recoverable amount.
An impairment review was carried out at 29 January 2011 and no further impairment or reversal was noted.
During the year to 30 January 2010, the Group announced the future closure of its Mansfield production site.
This resulted in the recognition of a provision of 1,820,000 in respect of the anticipated redundancy costs relating to the closure.
During the year to 29 January 2011, 157,000 of this provision was released as it was not considered necessary.
The remainder of these costs are anticipated to be incurred in the first quarter of 2011, when the site is expected to close.
As a result of the closure of the Mansfield site, a curtailment in the Group retirement pension plan has arisen.
This has resulted in an exceptional credit arising from the reduction in the retirement benefit obligation following a reduction in the number of employees remaining with the scheme.
The value of this credit is 341,000.
During the year to 30 January 2010, an impairment charge of 464,000 was recognised for the write down of the Atherton production site, which is held as an asset available for sale.
This was based on an indication that the market value of the site was less than the carrying value in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the estimation of the market value of this site during the year to 29 January 2011.

86 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the amount that would arise using the tax rate applicable to the profits of the consolidated Group as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Profit before tax 30,436 24,450 Tax at 28% 8,522 6,846 Tax effects of: Items that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 239 168 Current tax adjustment in respect of prior years 66 83 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years 306 465 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of change of deferred tax rate 705 Current year impact of change in deferred tax rate 40 Share options permanent difference 614 212 Permanent difference on impairment of intangible asset 89 Other differences 120 82 Total tax expense 7,851 6,502 The weighted average tax rate was 25.8% 2010: 26.6%.
A number of changes to the U. K. Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement, which was enacted during the year.
The Finance No 2 Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed, to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014.
As the reduction in the rate from 28% to 27% had been enacted at the statement of financial position date the effect of this rate change is reflected in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax, by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014, are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and have therefore not been recognised in these financial statements.
It has not been possible to quantify the impact of the changes in these rates.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the employee share scheme trusts.
2011 2010 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 000 22,585 17,948 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 38,385,598 38,318,076 Basic earnings per share pence 58.84 46.84 For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are: Customer Goodwill Brands Water rights relationships Total At 29 January 2011 000 000 000 000 000 Rubicon operating unit 21,036 42,986 1,942 65,964 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 74 8,976 Findlays operating unit Taut operating unit Vitsmart operating unit Total 22,938 49,986 2,016 74,940 A.

These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2011 2010 | Gross Growth Discount Gross Growth Discount margin rate rate margin rate rate % % % % % % Rubicon Groupe 37.18 2.25 9.54 40.46 2.25 8.66 Strathmore operating unit 29.00 2.25 9.54 32.10 8.66 The Rubicon operating unit can be further allocated across carbonates and still drinks when determining the CGU required for impairment testing.
No impairment was identified through this allocation.
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party with an additional risk premium of 2% added to reflect the risk relating to individual brands.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the breakdown, using latest annual budgets for the year to 28 January 2012 and projected costs thereafter.
The sports energy drink and vitamin drink markets continued to be challenging in the year to January 2011.
Following a strategic review in the six months to 31 July 2010, the directors took the decision to remove the Vitsmart brand from the vitamin drinks market.
As the product had no foreseeable future cash flows, the related goodwill of 18,000 and brand of 290,000 were fully impaired.
During the second half of the year, a further strategic decision was made to remove the Taut brand from the sports and energy drinks market for the foreseeable future.
Similarly, the goodwill of 318,000 recognised at the date of acquiring Taut U. K. Limited has been fully written off.
Neither of the brands have any other assets associated with them that require an impairment review.
The impairment costs have been charged as exceptional costs in the year to 29 January 2011.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At a discount rate of 12%, none of the remaining CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the conclusions reached.

The derivative financial liability is an interest rate swap relating to outstanding borrowings and is accounted for using hedge accounting.
The full fair value of the hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or liability as appropriate.
The balance of the swap was classified as a current liability at 29 January 2011 and as a non-current liability at 30 January 2010, in line with its expected maturity.
No ineffectiveness from the interest rate swap was recognised in the income statement during the year.
94 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 29 January 2011 were 15,255,000 2010: 25,830,000.
The fixed interest rate was 4.57% and the floating rate was LIBOR.
Gains and losses recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve on interest rate swap contracts as of 29 January 2011 will be released to the income statement over the period until it matures.
As the closing interest rate swap for both periods presented here is a liability, there is no credit risk at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data All financial instruments carried at fair value are Level 2: 2011 2010 000 000 Derivative financial assets 219 27 Derivative financial liabilities 416 1,024 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The table below sets out the comparison between the carrying amount and fair value of all of the Groups financial instruments, with the exception of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.

For the current borrowings, the impact of discounting is not significant as the borrowings will be paid within 12 months of the year end date.
The carrying amount approximates their fair value.
The fair values of the non-current borrowings are based on cash flows discounted using the current variable interest rate charged on the borrowings of 1.25% and a discount rate of 3%.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The credit to the income statement for the year ended 30 January 2010 was in relation to a grant received by Rubicon Drinks Limited, a subsidiary company.
The grant was fully released in the year to 30 January 2010.
All of the grants are being released over the expected lifetime of the assets that they were used to purchase.
Included in the closing balance is 59,000 2010: 59,000 of a government grant received in respect of the Atherton production site.
Until the Atherton site was classified as an asset classified as held for sale the grant was amortised to the income statement over the expected life of the site.
The amortisation ceased at the date that the site was classified as held for sale as the site was no longer being depreciated.
The balance will be released to the income statement when the site is sold.
The grant is not repayable to its issuer.

This has resulted in a 207,000 charge to equity in the year to 29 January 2011, included within the net charge for the year of 1,350,000.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24%.
These proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax are expected to be enacted separately each year.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and have therefore not been recognised in these financial statements.
It has not been possible to quantify the impact of the changes in these financial statements.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for unused capital losses of 1,895,000 2010: 1,895,000.
A further deferred tax asset of 1,204,000 2010: 1,248,000 has not been recognised in respect of acquired tax losses in Taut U. K. Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011 101 Notes to the Accounts continued 23 Lease commitments The total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows for the Group and Company: 2011 2010 000 000 No later than one year 1,033 599 More than one year but not more than five years 2,482 1,449 Due beyond five years 757 757 Total lease commitments 4,272 2,805 In the year to 30 January 2010 the Company entered into an operating lease for its Company car fleet.
This has resulted in an ongoing reduction in capital expenditure alongside an increase in the lease commitments in the year to 29 January 2011.
The Group also leases various office properties, warehouses and computer equipment.
Warehouse space at the Groups Mansfield site has been leased to a third party on a short term basis prior to the sale of the site.
Future minimum lease receivables under the non-cancellable operating lease total 18,000.
24 Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Groups finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The board provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally.
The Group primarily buys and sells in U. K. Sterling but does have some purchases and sales denominated in US Dollars and Euros.
For the year ended 29 January 2011, if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the US dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there would have been a negligible effect on post tax profit 30 January 2010: negligible impact on post tax profit.
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase Euros for known capital purchases where the value and volume of the purchase is known.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group.
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities, including sugar, plastic, aluminium and mango, is managed through the use of forward physical supply contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the Groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by the Treasury Committee.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the Groups overall pricing strategy.
All of the Groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the Groups ordinary operations, and are not net settled the Group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
102 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The majority of the Groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
As all of the commodity contracts qualify for the own use treatment, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings obtained at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by covering a significant proportion of its exposure using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
At 29 January 2011, if interest rates on Sterling-denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, there would have been a negligible change in the post tax profit for the year 30 January 2010: negligible impact.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If major customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set by the board based on internal or external ratings.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
Sales to direct to store customers are largely settled in cash in order to manage credit risk from smaller, independent stores.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash reserves and the availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting cash flows for capital expenditure and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Capital risk management The Group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt EBITDA ratio.
Net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The net debt position is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 18 to 25.
The net debt EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.
The Group believes that the current net debt EBITDA ratio provides an efficient capital structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 29 January 2011, the net debt EBITDA ratio was 0.4 times year ended 30 January 2010: 0.6 times.
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio ROCE.
In the financial year ended 29 January 2011, ROCE improved to 21.4% from 19.2%.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 103 Notes to the Accounts continued 25 Retirement benefit surplus obligations During the year the Company operated two pension schemes.
The two main schemes are the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
Full valuations of these schemes were conducted as at 1 April 2008 using the attained age method.
The total assets of the defined benefit scheme at valuation were 59,963,000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate, rate of inflation, real salary growth above inflation and life expectancy.
For the purposes of the 1 April 2008 valuation, it was assumed that the growth of the investment return would be 1.85% per annum higher than pensionable pay.
In the period after retirement, it was assumed that the investment return would be 0.6% per annum higher than the increase in pensions.
The deficit as at 1 April 2008 determined using the above assumptions was 10,300,000.
The valuation used for the defined benefit schemes has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.
The full actuarial valuation carried out at 1 April 2008 was updated to 29 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme for qualifying employees.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows: 2011 2010 Group and Company 000 000 Present value of funded obligations 77,414 74,217 Fair value of scheme assets 79,506 68,362 Surplus Liability recognised in the statement of financial position 2,092 5,855 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Interest on obligation 4,202 3,995 Expected return on scheme assets 4,446 3,624 Net finance income expense relating to defined benefit schemes note 6 244 371 Curtailment gain 341 Current service cost 1,305 1,007 Total cost recognised in the income statement 720 1,378 The current service charge has been included within Administration costs in the income statement.
The curtailment gain has arisen due to the closure of the Mansfield production site.
The Groups defined benefit obligation reduced by 341,000, with a corresponding 341,000 credit being recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional items.
104 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Opening defined benefit obligation 74,217 62,102 Service cost 1,305 1,007 Interest cost 4,202 3,995 Curtailment gain 341 Actuarial losses 320 9,388 Members contributions 90 167 Benefits paid 2,305 2,328 Premiums paid 74 114 Closing defined benefit obligation 77,414 74,217 The U. K. Government announced on 8 July 2010 that statutory pension increases or revaluations would be based on the Consumer Prices Index measure of price inflation from 2011, rather than the Retail Prices Index measure of price inflation.
Under the rules of the defined benefit element of the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the change in the measure has only affected deferred members of the scheme.
Under the accounting policies of the Group, the change in the assumption is accounted for as an actuarial gain, and in the year to 29 January 2011, has resulted in a reduction in defined benefit obligation of 500,000.
Changes in the fair value of the schemes assets are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Opening fair value of scheme assets 68,362 57,113 Expected return 4,446 3,624 Actuarial gains 4,918 5,890 Employers contributions 4,069 4,010 Members contributions 90 167 Benefits paid 2,305 2,328 Premiums paid 74 114 Closing fair value of scheme assets 79,506 68,362 The analysis of the movement in the statement of financial position is as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Opening net liability 5,855 4,989 Total expense recognised in the income statement 720 1,378 Employers contributions 4,069 4,010 Net actuarial gains losses recognised in the year 4,598 3,498 Closing net surplus liability 2,092 5,855 Cumulative gains losses 2011 2010 000 000 Cumulative amount at start of year 1,059 2,439 Actuarial gains losses recognised in the year 4,598 3,498 Cumulative amount at end of year 3,539 1,059 A.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 6.54% assumption as at 29 January 2011, and is the expected long term rate of return for the year ending 28 January 2012.
