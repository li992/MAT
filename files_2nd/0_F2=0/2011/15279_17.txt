Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report 2011 60 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 4 Segmental analysis The chief operating decision maker of the Group is considered to be the Executive Committee, which reviews internal reports prepared on a divisional basis in order to allocate the resources of the Group and to assess business performance.
Following the acquisition of PolymerLatex the Group revised its reporting to the Executive Committee for these purposes and now reports under three revised reportable segments under IFRS 8, being Polymer Chemicals Europe & North America, Polymer Chemicals Asia & Rest of World, and Pharma Chemicals.
As noted in the Chairmans Statement the Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business in the second half of 2011 and now recognises this as a discontinued activity in this Annual Report.
The Group no longer allocates the UK defined benefit pension scheme deficit to a specific segment.
The segmental analysis below in respect of 2010 has been restated to reflect the change in segmentation discussed above.
Substantially all revenues earned by the Group are from the sale of Polymer products derived from petrochemical monomers.

With completion of the acquisition of PolymerLatex the Board undertook a review of future options for the Pharma business and concluded that it was non-core to the Group moving forward.
As part of this review the carrying value of the goodwill associated with this business was re-assessed, with the conclusion that it had been impaired.
The goodwill was accordingly written down to zero in the period to 30 June 2011.
On 30 November 2011 the remaining operating entities of the Pharma business were disposed of see note 28 for further details.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Following the acquisition of PolymerLatex, the Group re-assessed its CGUs for goodwill impairment testing.
The revised CGUs better reflect the composition and operational structure of the Group, and the expected benefit of synergies from the acquisition.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% and 12% have been used in the above calculations.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts: for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of between 2% and 5% have been used, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets concerned.

Part of the consideration agreed with the buyer, totalling $10,000,000, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before 30 September 2014.
In the event that the buyer is unable to fulfil his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an irrevocable bank guarantee held in favour of Yule Catto & Co plc by HSBC Bank plc.
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore included it in these financial statements as a non-current Financial Asset, and within the Groups definition of Net Borrowings.
The amount of 5,589,000 included in non-current assets represents the agreed amount of $10,000,000 discounted at the rate of 5% per annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound on this discounting in the period up to 31 December 2011.

At 31 December 2011, the Group had available 60 million 2010 30 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

The special item fair value adjustment represents the revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges prior to the adoption of IFRS.
23 Financial instruments The Groups treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 22, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in Derivative Financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Carrying values Fair values at 31 December at 31 December 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Fair value of financial assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 145,726 108,958 145,726 108,958 Cash and cash equivalents 85,922 36,211 85,922 36,211 Financial asset 5,589 5,589 Derivatives at fair value 17,368 22,765 17,368 22,765 167,934 167,934 254,605 254,605 Fair value of financial liabilities Loan notes 87,065 92,775 87,208 91,817 Bank loans and overdrafts 160,432 25,190 160,432 25,190 Derivatives at fair value 5,628 5,628 Trade and other payables excluding accruals 146,297 117,699 146,297 117,699 399,565 229,954 404,174 235,664 Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report 2011 76 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 23 Financial instruments continued Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk The Groups main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2010 none.
Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 3,317,000 have been debited to the income statement in the year 2010 credit of 2,645,000.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
On 31 March 2011, as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex Group see note 29, the Group acquired a number of Interest Rate Swap agreements that had been used by the former PolymerLatex Group to Hedge external borrowings.
In the period since completion several of these contracts were terminated, with the Group electing to retain those which in combination represent a floating to fixed interest rate swap on a Euro amount of 155 million.
On 1 July 2011, the Group designated these remaining contracts as Hedging Instruments in order to use them as an effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Groups Euro denominated, floating rate, 150 million Term Loan.
As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cashflow Hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
In addition the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency.
These contracts have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.

For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
