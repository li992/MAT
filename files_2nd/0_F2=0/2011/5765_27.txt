D. Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented.
Tangible fixed assets Leasehold improvements are held at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price and amounts attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off such assets on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated life and the remaining period of the lease.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases and not capitalised.
Payments made under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Investments - shares in Group undertakings Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provisions necessary for permanent diminution in value.
The fair value of share incentives issued by the Company to employees of subsidiary undertakings is accounted for as a capital contribution and recognised as an increase in the Company's investment in Group undertakings with a corresponding increase in total shareholders' funds.
Impairment of fixed assets Where there is an indication of impairment, fixed assets are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
Any impairment is recognised in the year in which it occurs.
Debtors and creditors Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at this value.
Where the time value of money is material, such items are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Creditors are initially recognised at fair value.
Where the time value of money is material such items are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank includes deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The interest differential reflected in forward foreign exchange contracts is taken to interest receivable and similar income or interest payable and similar charges.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised at fair value, based on forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Financial statements 153 D.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Own shares Treasury shares, purchased in connection with the Companys share buyback programme, are shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
Contractual obligations to purchase such shares are recognised at the net present value of expected future payments.
Gains and losses in connection with such obligations are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Group has a number of equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans and, in connection with these plans, shares in the Company are held by The Experian plc Employee Share Trust and the Experian UK Approved All-Employee Share Plan.
The assets, liabilities and expenses of these separately administered trusts are included in the Companys financial statements as if they were the Companys own.
The assets of the trusts mainly comprise shares in the Company and such shares are also shown as a deduction from total shareholders funds at cost.
Gains and losses in connection with contractual obligations to purchase such shares are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments The Groups equity settled, share-based employee incentive plans include options and awards in respect of shares in the Company made at or after demerger in October 2006 together with options and awards previously granted in respect of shares in GUS plc which were rolled over into options and awards in respect of shares in the Company at demerger.
The fair value of such options and awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised after taking into account the Companys best estimate of the number of options and awards expected to vest.
The Company revises the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date and nonmarket performance conditions are included in the vesting estimates.
Amounts are recognised over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award.
Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revised for actual performance.
