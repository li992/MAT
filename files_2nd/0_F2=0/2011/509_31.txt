Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2011 28 Company accounting policies Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies is set out below.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the assets into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowings costs are not capitalised.
Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
The principal period of depreciation used is as follows: Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashflows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows income-generating units.
Foreign currencies At individual Company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Companys financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
Derivative financial instruments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 97, however the UK GAAP standards are applied specifically FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement and FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
Cash flow statement and related party disclosures The Company is included in the Group Accounts of Aggreko plc, which are publicly available.
Consequently, the Company is not required to produce a cash flow statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 Cash Flow Statements revised 1996.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group.
Taxation The charge for ordinary taxation is based on the profit loss for the year and takes into account full provision for deferred tax, using the approach set out in FRS 19, Deferred Tax in respect of timing differences on a nondiscounted basis.
Such timing differences arise primarily from the differing treatment for taxation and accounting purposes of provisions and depreciation of fixed assets.
Pensions The Company operates both a defined benefit pension scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme.
The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 99.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost, or nominal value of the shares issued as consideration where applicable, less provision for any impairment in value.
Share-based payments recharged to subsidiary undertakings are treated as capital contributions and are added to investments.

Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 99 with the exception that shares issued by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries for which no consideration is received are treated as an increase in the Companys investment in those subsidiaries.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.

Current borrowings and overdrafts liquid resources The fair value of liquid resources and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of non-current borrowings, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet.
iii Financial instruments Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below.
Additional disclosures are set out in the financial review and accounting policies relating to risk management.
