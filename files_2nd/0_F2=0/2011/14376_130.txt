Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares.
For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing price of an Ordinary Share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions.
Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year.

The 2004 Plan is open to Executive Directors only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share option plans are settled in shares.

Options granted under the executive plans are valued using a binomial model.
Options granted under employee plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
Options granted under each plans are valued separately and a weighted average fair value calculated.
The binomial model is used for executive plans so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2011 grant management expected 90% of the options granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 to vest 2010 90%, 2009 n a, 90% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2010 90%, 2009 60%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Employee plans Executive plans 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Dividend yield % 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Expected volatility % i 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30.0 30 Risk free interest rate % ii 2.0 2.5 3.3 2.0 2.5 3.3 Expected life in years iii 3.9 3.9 3.9 10.0 9.8 6.8 i Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
ii The risk free interest rate reects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.
iii An assessment of an Executive Plans option life is based on an exercise model.
This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits.
5% 2010 5%, 2009 5% of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to leave and exercise their options or forfeit them if under water each year after vesting.
In addition, 50% 2010 50%, 2009 50% of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010 2010 50% for the 2004 Plan and 50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010, 2009 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans.
Summarised information about options outstanding under the share option plans at 31 December 2011 is as follows: Weighted average remaining Number outstanding contract life Thousand Years Employee Plans: 348.0p to 639.9p 3,577 2.6 639.9p to 640.0p 3 0.3 3,580 2.6 Executive Plans: 409.5p to 639.9p 23,628 6.6 639.9p to 703.0p 108 3.0 23,736 6.6 The split has been determined based on the weighted average share price of 639.9p.
As at 31 December 2011 nil 2010 nil, 2009 77,669 options remain outstanding under the 1999 and 2000 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan.
The fair value liability related to these schemes was $nil in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
This was materially the same as intrinsic value.
125 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Accounts and other information Corporate Governance Business Review Strategy, KPIs & Risk management Overview Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued Share based payments long-term incentive plans In 2004, a share based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, executive ofcers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan is designed to encourage executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one third each year.
No further performance conditions will apply to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards are granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all executives other than Executive Directors.
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the gures below.
Vesting of the share awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term incentive plans is $nil.
Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 40% 2010 35%, 2009 30% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
A correlation of 40% 2010 35%, 2009 30% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors.
The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of EPSA growth and the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over the three year performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 24.1 a.
At 31 December 2011 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded under the Groups long-term incentive plans was: Deferred Other Awards PSP CIP Bonus Plan Total Number of shares in thousands Outstanding at 1 January 2009 3,817 750 4,567 Awarded 2,372 305 2,677 Vested 334 99 7 440 Forfeited 975 206 6 1,187 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 4,880 445 292 5,617 Awarded 2,386 338 2,724 Vested 501 116 101 718 Forfeited 753 132 7 892 Outstanding at 31 December 2010 6,012 197 522 6,731 Awarded 838 2,282 351 3,471 Vested 44 366 375 785 Forfeited 1,660 197 6 1,863 Outstanding at 31 December 2011 794 6,268 492 7,554 Other Awards mainly comprises of conditional share awards granted under the Global Share Plan 2010.
