We have achieved this against a backdrop of continuing economic uncertainty, high food cost inflation and the tragic events earlier this year in Japan.
I am immensely proud of the hard work and commitment to achieving these goals shown by my colleagues around the Group.
Our core focus remains on delivering shareholder value from the significant structural opportunity in foodservice around the world and in building our capability in support services.
We are now well into the growth phase of our journey, a phase in which our core aim is sustainable and disciplined growth.
And we are making good progress, building on the strong foundations we have put in place, and retaining our emphasis on operational excellence in our pursuit of growth.
The economic backdrop is still very volatile and is likely to remain so for some time.
Our flexible cost base and the significant cost benefits of outsourcing give us confidence that amidst the challenges of this economic environment there are also opportunities for us.
Our Management and Performance programme, MAP, is fully embedded across the Group and continues to drive efficiencies and act as a framework around which to share best practices between our teams.
Sustainability Whilst organic growth remains our priority, over the last two years we have increased our focus on small, infill acquisitions and these are now making a meaningful contribution to growth.
The combination of a solid top line and the and continued delivery of significant efficiency gains has delivered strong profit growth and cash flow generation and has enabled us to increase our investment in the exciting opportunities we see around the world.

94% Group retention rate Increasingly, were seeing countries share best practice across the world and weve invested more in resource and training to support this.
28 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Strategic Alliance Group Encouragingly, this year we have seen an improvement in the rate of retention in over 70% of comparable countries.
So, how have we achieved this?
Our best practice retention framework is based on a simple model created by our business in the USA, which we call the Strategic Alliance Group.
It is a semi-independent team that focuses solely on retention, firstly, by interviewing clients to determine how we can improve our quality and service and, secondly, by proactively renegotiating contracts.
This process is systematic and well defined.
Where we adopt this model, we consistently see improvement and were optimistic that the ongoing rollout of this approach will result in a better retention performance across the Group.
