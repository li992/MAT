The Board of Cairn Energy PLC reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Groups treasury functions are responsible for managing these risks, in accordance with the policies set by the Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The primary financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash, short and medium-term deposits, certificates of deposit, money market liquidity, listed equity shares, intra-group loans, forward contracts, currency and interest rate swaps, options, and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity and other forms of non investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate.
Liquidity Risk On 15 December 2010 Cairn Energy PLC entered into a stand-by secured revolving credit facility of $900m to extend the working capital available, to enable commitments to be made for the 2011 Greenland drilling campaign and for other general corporate purposes.
The facility was provided by Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of Scotland PLC, Crdit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, HSBC Bank PLC and Socit Gnrale.
Security was in the form of a pledge over a number of shares in Cairn UK Holdings Limited.
Interest was charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The facility was cancelled and repaid in full on 1 August 2011.
At December 2011 Cairn Energy PLC Group had $35m of facilities in place to cover the issue of performance guarantees.
Fixed rates of bank commission and chargesapplied to these.
$2.6m was utilised as at 31 December 2011.
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed in a combination of money market liquidity funds and term deposits with a number of international financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium-term expenditure requirements.
The Group is conscious of the current environment and constantly monitors counterparty risk.
Policies are in place to limit counterparty exposure and maturity.
The Group monitors counterparties using published ratings and other measures.
Repayment of principal is the overriding priority and this is achieved by diversification and shorter maturities to provide flexibility.
Interest Rate Risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium-term deposits at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to invest with banks or other financial institutions that, first, offer what is perceived as the greatest security and, second, offer the most competitive interest rate.
Managing counterparty risk is considered the priority.
Short medium-term borrowing arrangements are generally entered into at floating rates.
From time to time the Group may opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs by using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2010: none.
Foreign Currency Risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Generally the exposure has been limited given that receipts and payments have mostly been in US Dollars and the functional currency of most companies in the Group is US Dollars.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in functional currency which in most cases is US Dollars, thereby matching the reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant the Company and Group may from time to time opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.

The Groups and the Companys exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

At the year end the Company held approximately 2.25 billion of cash in anticipation of the cash return to shareholders noted in Section 7.2.
Following the completion of this return both the Groups and Companys exposure to movements in the Sterling to $ exchange rate reduces significantly.
The Group realised an exchange loss of $39.2m on the Sterling cash balances held at the year end.
Credit Risk Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the Board-approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC.
Investments of surplus funds are only made with approved counterparties who meet the appropriate rating and or other criteria, and are only made within approved limits.
The Board continually re-assesses the Groups policy and updates as required.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty failure.
Cairn Energy PLC Group limits the placing of deposits, certificates of deposit and other investments to banks or financial institutions that have at least two Aor above ratings from Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch unless a Sovereign Guarantee is available from an AAA-rated Government.
The counterparty limits vary between $50m and $200m depending on the ratings of the counterparty.
During the period, following the receipt of the proceeds of the 30% tranche of the 40% sale of Cairn India Limited, until the completion of the return of cash to shareholders, these limits were increased to $100m $400m per counterparty.
No investments are placed with any counterparty with a five year CDS exceeding 250 bps.
Investments in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA-rated liquidity funds and the maximum holding in any single fund is 5% of total investments.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in Section 3.3.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had investments with 32 counterparties 2010: ten to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Market Risk: Equity Price Risk The Group is now exposed to equity price risks arising from the listed equity investments it holds in Cairn India following the completion of the disposal of the 40% interest during the year.
Equity investments are held for strategic rather than trading purposes and the Group does not actively trade these investments, which are classified as available-for-sale.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale financial assets will be recycled through the Income Statement.
This financial asset is held at a fair value of $2,463.3m, based on the closing market value of INR 314.25 at 31 December 2011.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks at the reporting date, assuming all other variables are held constant.
2011 Effect on profit Effect on before tax Equity $m $m Increase to closing price of 400 INR 530.9 Increase to closing price of 350 INR 221.4 Decrease to closing price of 300 INR 82.2 Net profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have been unaffected as no investments were disposed of post recognition.

h Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options.
h The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
h Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 69 to 87, over a ten year period to the date of award.
