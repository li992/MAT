All derivative financial instruments are in level 2 of the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the carrying value of that asset or liability.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
easyJet uses forward contracts to hedge US dollar transaction currency risk comprising fuel, leasing and maintenance payments, jet fuel price risk and euro and Swiss franc revenues.
Where these hedges are assessed as highly effective, gains and losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and transferred to the income statement or cost of property, plant and equipment when the related cash flow occurs.
