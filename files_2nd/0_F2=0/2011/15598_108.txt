FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements NOTE 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Groups hedging policies are further described below.
Finance income of 27m 2010 20m resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and cross currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by the Group.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement under the effective interest rate method.
A loss of 369m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a gain of 396m on hedged items 2010 a loss of 65m on hedging instruments was offset by a gain of 85m on hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, mark-to-market gains and losses are deferred in equity.
These hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur and will affect the Group Income Statement within one year of the balance sheet date.
The Group also uses index-linked swaps to hedge cash flows on index-linked debt, interest rate swaps to hedge interest cash flows on debt and cross currency swaps to hedge intercompany loan cash flows denominated in South Korean Won KRW.
Net investment hedges The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts, currency denominated borrowings and currency swaps to hedge the exposure of a proportion of its non-Sterling denominated assets against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a KRW denominated liability relating to the future purchase of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, Homeplus Co. Limited formerly Samsung Tesco Co. Limited.
This liability has been designated as a net investment hedge of a proportion of the assets of Homeplus Co. Limited.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Group Income Statement on disposal of the overseas operation.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes, however, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item naturally offset in the Group Income Statement.
These instruments include caps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
The Group had a liability relating to the future purchases of the minority shareholding of its subsidiary, dunnhumby Limited, which has been purchased during the financial year.
Changes in the value of that liability were recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.

Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is the same as their carrying value.
