There is an amount of delegated authority to the Treasury Committee, but all activities are summarised in half yearly treasury reports which are presented to the Audit Committee.
The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, bonds, other borrowings, finance leases and trade and other creditors.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade debtors and cash and short term deposits which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, in the form of forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and energy price contracts.
The purpose of these derivative instruments is to manage risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
As part of normal banking arrangements, the Group utilises letters of credit in order to facilitate contracts with third parties.
The financial derivatives relating to commitments entered into during the year are to manage the risks arising from its usage of energy and foreign currency.
It remains the Groups policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, which remain unchanged from the prior year, are stated below: i Foreign currency risk The Group makes the majority of its purchases in Sterling, however it incurs currency exposure in respect of overseas trade purchases made in currencies other than Sterling, primarily being Euro and US Dollar.
The Groups objective is to reduce risk to short term profits and losses from exchange rate fluctuations.
It is Group policy that any transactional currency exposures recognised to have a material impact on short term profits and losses will be hedged through the use of derivative financial instruments.
As at the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure on up to 50% 2010: 50% of its forecasted purchases within the next six months.
The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change 20% in the US Dollar Euro exchange rate has been determined as being immaterial.
ii Liquidity risk The Group policy is to maintain a balance of funding with a range of maturities and a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group finances its operations with a combination of bank credit facilities and bonds.
The Treasury Committee monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve on a quarterly basis, which comprises committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities on the basis of expected cash flow.
At the year end, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 625m note 17 : these facilities remain available to the Group.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups other financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, which includes interest payments.
Creditors and current tax liabilities have been excluded from this analysis as these balances are due within 12 months and their contractual undiscounted payments equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating rate, an estimate for interest has been made.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups as well as credit exposures from other sources of income such as supplier income and tenants of investment properties.
The Group maintains deposits with banks and financial institutions with an acceptable credit rating for a period not exceeding six months.
Further, the Group has specified limits that can be deposited with any banking group or financial institution at any point.
The maximum exposure on cash and cash equivalents and deposits is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group does not expect any significant performance losses from counterparties.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that tenants of investment properties who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 15.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
iv Other risk Pricing risk: The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities.
This does not include fuel purchased for resale to customers.
The Treasury Committee reviews the Groups market price exposure to these commodities on a quarterly basis and determines a strategy for utilising derivative financial products in order to mitigate the volatility of energy prices.
The Group intends to hold derivatives to maintain cover of its energy purchases of up to 75% over an appropriate timescale.
Cash flow interest rate risk: The Groups long term policy is to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining up to 60% of its consolidated total net debt in fixed rate borrowings over a four-year horizon.
As at the balance sheet date 55% 2010: 61% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rate, thereby substantially reducing the Groups exposure to adverse movements in interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents are a significant interest-bearing asset held by the Group.
At year end, a 1% movement in interest rate would have had a 2m 2010: 2m impact on the Groups annual finance income expense.
There are no other significant interest-bearing assets held by the Group.

The Groups objectives are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern providing returns to shareholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
Initiatives available to achieve the Groups desired capital structure include adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new shares and buying back share capital.
A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the revolving credit facility.
The Groups policy is to maintain both a gearing ratio and interest cover, which represents headroom of at least 10% over and above the requirements laid down in the revolving credit facility.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with this policy.
There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regards to capital management during the years ended 30 January 2011 and 31 January 2010. c Fair values i Financial assets All financial derivatives are held at fair value which has been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments are traded.
Cash and cash equivalents and Debtors are held at book value which equals the fair value.
The values of the financial assets are disclosed within note 14. ii Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost.
The Euro bonds are retranslated at balance sheet date spot rates.
The fair value of the Sterling and Euro bonds are measured using closing market prices.
These compare to carrying values as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Amortised Fair Amortised Fair cost value cost value m m m m Total bonds current 198 220 Total bonds non-current 559 621 561 598 559 621 759 818 The fair value of other items within current and non-current borrowing equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
d Hedging activities Cash flow hedge At 31 January 2010, the Company held a cross-currency swap was been designated as a cash flow hedge.
This derivative financial instrument was used to minimise risk from potential movements in foreign exchange rates inherent in cash flow of certain liabilities which have been settled during the current year.
To minimise the risk from potential movements in energy prices, the Group has energy price contracts which are also designated as cash flow hedges.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
The hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
At 30 January 2011, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed was 54m 2010: 51m.
The fair value of these outstanding forward exchange contracts at the balance sheet date was a liability of nil 2010: 1m.

The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Group at 30 January 2011 and 31 January 2010 are financial derivatives and all are categorised as Level 2 instruments.

It has been announced that the tax rate will continue to be reduced by 1% per year to 24%.
This has yet to be enacted.
20 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morrison and Safeway schemes, providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2010 and 1 April 2010 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 30 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2011 77 Strategic review 4 21 Performance review 22 31 Governance 32 51 Group financial statements 52 88 Company financial statements 89 101 Investor information 102 105 20 Pensions continued a Defined benefit pension scheme continued During the prior year, the pension schemes moved from a final salary basis to career average revalued earnings representing an accounting curtailment of certain pension liabilities.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the defined pension schemes obligations were revalued by the schemes actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
As a result a pensions credit of 91m was recognised in profit for the period during the prior year.
On 8 July 2010 the Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI will be used as the basis for inflationary increases to pensions in its next update of the statutory requirement.
Following this, the Accounting Standards Board has issued UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for retirement benefits clarifying the required accounting treatment and indicating the use of CPI rather than RPI where the scheme rules allow.
In the absence of specific guidance issued under IFRS, the requirements of this UITF have been applied in accounting for this change.
The Group has consulted with its advisors and based on review of certain clauses in the schemes trust deeds has concluded that this change is applicable to certain deferred members within the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The trust deeds state that for those members affected, a statutory index should be used and therefore the actuarial assumptions applied within this financial report have been updated accordingly.
This has resulted in a credit of 72m recognised in other comprehensive income within actuarial gains losses during the year.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the Trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 31 January 2011 is 36m 2010: 42m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
The assumptions used at the valuation date of 2 July 2009, used in calculating the pension credit recognised in the year to 31 January 2010 of 91m, remained the same as the previous year end 1 February 2009 apart from the discount rate, which reduced from 6.25% to 6.0%.
i Financial 2011 2010 2009 Rate of increases in salaries 5.05% 4.855.85% 4.755.75% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.30%3.80% 3.60% 3.50% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.60% 5.65% 6.25% Inflation assumption 3.80% 3.60% 3.50% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Male 24.2 23.5 23.5 Female 25.1 25.8 25.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Male 21.8 22.2 22.2 Female 22.8 24.7 24.7 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45-year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65-year-old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up-to-date tables are used in each period.

As disclosed in the Critical accounting assumptions on page 59, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.45% 7.25% 7.00% Corporate bonds 5.60% 5.65% 6.00% Gilts 4.44% 4.35% 4.254.50% Property related funds 5.60% 5.65% 6.00% Cash 1.50% 1.50% 2.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
c Valuations Assets of the schemes are held in order to generate cash to be used to satisfy the schemes obligations, and are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The allocation of assets between categories is governed by the Investment Principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committees.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Equities 1,001 798 592 Corporate bonds 667 636 547 Gilts 622 609 545 Property and property related funds 4 54 71 Cash 10 14 3 Total fair value of schemes assets 2,304 2,111 1,758 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 2,266 2,128 1,807 Net pension asset liability recognised in the balance sheet 38 17 49 Related deferred tax liability asset note 19 10 5 14 Net surplus deficit 28 12 35 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 2,111 1,758 1,939 Expected return on scheme assets 126 105 130 Actuarial gain loss recognised in other comprehensive income 62 245 425 Employer contributions 41 42 141 Employee contributions 10 10 10 Benefits paid 46 49 37 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 2,304 2,111 1,758 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

In June 2001, the Company established a stakeholder pension scheme, open to all employees, to which the Company makes matching contributions of a maximum of 5% of eligible earnings.
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Stakeholder pension scheme 4 3 3 Life assurance scheme 2 2 1 Total costs 6 5 4 21 Provisions Property provisions m At 31 January 2010 100 Charged to comprehensive income 3 Unused amounts reversed during the period 10 Utilised in period 6 Unwinding of discount 5 At 30 January 2011 92 Property provisions comprise onerous leases provision, petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and provisions for dilapidations on leased buildings.
Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from 1 to 62 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
As noted in the Financial review, the amount reversed in the period primarily relates to a store that has been reopened as it fits well with our new smaller stores format and a number of tenants lease breakpoints being passed resulting in a continuing commitment from the tenants to continue the lease.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition in which it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.

a Share option schemes i Executive share option scheme In May 1995, the Group adopted the 1995 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme which was made available to Directors and other senior employees.
The scheme was terminated on 25 May 2005.
The scheme offered options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of the ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in Group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of the grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
The fair value of options granted has been calculated using a binomial stochastic option pricing model and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 12 Nov 2004 02 Apr 2003 Share price at grant date 2.33 1.81 Fair value of options granted 1.4m 1.9m Exercise price 2.22 1.75 Dividend yield 1.43% 1.49% Annual risk free interest rate 4.61% 4.12% Expected volatility 29.4% 29.4% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the last six years prior to the date of grant.

The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is only subject to service conditions and is equity-settled.
Those options which have been granted to those eligible employees, including Directors, who chose to participate in the scheme have been fair valued using a binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 18 May 2010 14 May 2009 18 May 2007 24 Apr 2006 Share price at grant date 2.70 2.43 3.26 1.94 Fair value of options granted 9.7m 17.4m 12.3m 16.2m Exercise price 2.37 1.98 2.47 1.58 Dividend yield 3.04% 2.38% 1.23% 1.91% Annual risk free interest rate 1.63% 2.10% 5.58% 4.57% 1 Expected volatility 26.5% 28.0% 23.5% 25.6% 1 The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expect share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.25 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model using the assumptions disclosed above.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.
