D. Additional information unaudited As the Group has only recently transitioned into gold production at its Gold Ridge Project and is continuing the process of establishing a stable operating base, it is considered impractical to provide a meaningful measure of historical Group financial performance in relation to Executive Director remuneration.
It is intended that as the Groups operations stabilise that a more structured performance measurement and reward framework for Executive Director will be designed and implemented in consultation with the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.
It is anticipated that such a framework will include the establishment of key performance indicators that align Executive Director remuneration with Group performance and shareholder returns.
