Summary of significant accounting policies continued Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of EnQuest market conditions or non-vesting conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting period.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The profit and loss account charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail within note 20 of the Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.
