ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 137 Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year ended 31 December 2011 SRK Consulting UK Ltd. SRK has reviewed and restated in line with the 2004 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves the JORC Code as published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for the various mining assets of ENRC.
For the Kazakhstan assets this involved reviewing the GKZ reserve statements as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as of 31 December 2011.
SRK has modified and translated ENRCs GKZ reserve statements and restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the terms and definitions given in the JORC Code, without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
Since preparing an independent Mineral Experts Report MER on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of ENRC in 2007, SRK has prepared annual updates of the JORC Code compliant Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves with site visits being undertaken on a two to three year basis.
Site visits to Kazchromes Donskoy GOK chrome operations and Zhairemsky GOKs manganese and iron-manganese operations were undertaken in February 2009 and February 2012.
Site visits to Eurasian Energy Corporations EEC Vostochny open pit coal mine and the SSGPO iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010, and Aluminium of Kazakhstans AoK KBRU and TBRU bauxite mines were most recently visited in February 2011.
The team that visited Zhairemsky GOK in February 2012 also visited Kazchromes Kazmarganets manganese mining operations.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2010 form the basis for the current update.
In addition to the Kazakhstan assets, Mineral Resource and, where appropriate, Ore Reserve statements have been reviewed and restated for Bahia Minerao SAs formerly known as BML Pedra fide Ferro and Jurema iron ore projects in Brazil and several of Boss Mining SMKKs copper and cobalt assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC.
The dates of these statements relied on the data availability and are therefore not necessarily stated as per 31 December 2011.
For BMSA, in line with the BFS Upside Assessment Report UAR statement, the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are stated as of 1 June 2011.
For the Boss Mining and SMKK assets, the date of the Mineral Resource statement is as of 30 June 2011 for the Kakanda South and North deposits, as of 31 December 2011 for the Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela deposits, and as of 1 March 2012 for the Kavundi, Taratara, Saafi and Chimbedia deposits.
Site visits to the DRC assets were most recently carried out in February 2012.
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve statements in conjunction with ENRCs price forecasts.
The long-term prices used to support the current Ore Reserve declarations are: Chromite at US$294 tonne and HCFeCr at US$2,418 tonne: Manganese concentrate products between US$103 tonne low grade and US$215 tonne high grade and iron-manganese concentrate products of US$53 tonne: SSGPO iron ore at US$77 tonne for 66% concentrates, US$83 tonne for 69% concentrates, US$108 tonne for 63.5% pellets, US$117 tonne for 67% pellets, and US$381 tonne for HBI briquettes: BMSA Blast Furnace product at US$55 tonne, and US$68 tonne for direct reduction product, as per the Upside Assessment Report statement, dated 1 June 2011: Alumina at US$378 tonne: and EEC at US$9 tonne for domestic coal sales and US$35 tonne for export coal sales.
SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate.
A detailed information request list was submitted by SRK, and ENRC provided data during January and February 2012.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statements are based on the assumptions, assessments, recommendations and material changes as stated below.
Ferroalloys Division Kazchrome Donskoy GOK Chrome ore In 2011 Donskoy produced 4.4 Mt of run of mine ore. Molodezhnaya underground mine produced 2.4 Mt and has a mine life of 11 years, producing between 1.7 and 2.4 Mtpa for the next ten years.
The 10th Anniversary underground mine produced 1.9 Mt and has a mine life of 44 years, with an average 1.7 Mtpa from Phase 1 for the next 20 years.
The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2020, with production building up to around 4.9 Mtpa in 2031, continuing to 2055.
A significant portion of the Ore Reserves is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for both near surface and deposits at depth.
Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher cost than the current method being utilised.
Due to the integrated structure of the Donskoy mines with the Aksu and Aktobe smelters, this higher mining cost will not negatively impact on the current Ore Reserve statement.
Yuzhny open pit mined a minimal 0.03 Mt in 2011 and is due to produce 2.5 Mt of ore between 2013 and 2018, at a high stripping ratio.
The Mineral Resource has decreased in line with depletion from the 2011 production.
The Ore Reserves have decreased both in line with depletion due to production and due to reclassification of portions of the Donskoy GOKs mine plans in line with the requirements of the JORC Code, the latter amounting to only 2.6% of the Ore Reserve total.
The investments required to sustain the current operations and to provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have been adequately allowed for.
138 Unlocking Value Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year ended 31 December 2011 continued Ferroalloys Division continued Kazmarganets Manganese ore The Ore Reserves for Tur are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2020.
The current mining contract for Tur expires on 7 October 2021.
The Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserves are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2013.
The current mining contract for Vostochny Kamys expires on 28 June 2018.
No operational changes are planned.
Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter, and the Ore Reserves have therefore been stated on the basis that they are part of the integrated Kazchrome operations.
During 2011 the mines combined produced 1.0 Mt of manganese ore.
Overall comment on Kazchrome The production levels planned for the chrome mines, process plants and smelters, and the respective operating costs, are considered to be realistic.
The 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have substantial expansion plans and these appear to have been adequately investigated, planned and costed.
The Ore Reserves for Donskoy and Kazmarganets are supported by the overall profitability of Kazchrome.
Whilst minor recommendations have been made to ENRC, SRK finds all other requirements to be in place, including the mining contracts.
Zhairemsky GOK Manganese and Iron-Manganese ores The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at Zhairemsky GOK have reduced by 2.6 Mt and 1.4 Mt respectively as a result of mining activities and stockpile depletion.
The majority of production has been sourced from the Ushkatyn III open pit manganese operations 1.11 Mt, with additional manganese ore sourced about equally from the Ushkatyn III underground mine 0.30 Mt and Zhomart open pit 0.31 Mt.
Minor iron-manganese ore mining has taken place during 2011 120 kt.
There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Zhairemsky GOK outside of mining depletion activities in 2011.
The current mining contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013.
The Ore Reserves for the Zhairemsky GOK deposits are based on a life of mine plan to the end of 2031.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these mining contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life of mine plans.
In addition to the manganese and iron-manganese Mineral Resources at Zhairemsky, additional polymetallic Mineral Resources are also stated in the Annual Report and Accounts this year.
Iron Ore Division SSGPO Iron ore In 2011 SSGPO produced 43.2 Mt of iron ore at 32.3% iron, from four open pits and one underground mine.
The current mining contract expires in May 2015.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the assumption that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25 year extension of this contract until 2040 under similar terms and conditions.
The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for SSGPO until 2040.
Currently no Ore Reserves are stated for the Sorsky and Shagyrkulsky deposits, but technical studies are currently being completed for the Sorsky deposit, which could potentially support full or partial conversion of the Indicated Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.
The Mineral Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2040.
BMSA Iron ore The Statement is in line with the Pedra fide Ferro PdF project BFS Upside Assessment Report Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statement as issued at 1 June 2011.
The Mineral Resources for PdF have been derived from those mineral rights licence areas that are attributable to BMSA as at this date, namely 870.830 2004, 870.283 2005, 811.466 1973, 292 1958, and 5247 1958.
At the planned annual production rate for the UAR of 19.5Mt of product, the life of mine will be 16 years.
SRK however notes that construction for the UAR project has not yet started and plans are likely to change.
If ENRC decides to proceed with an alternative development plan for the PdF project, it is very likely the Ore Reserves will be affected.
In addition to the Mineral Resources for PdF, BMSA also has reported Mineral Resources for Jurema Blocks 1 & 4, dated as at 9 January 2009.
Alumina and Aluminium Division AoK Bauxite In 2011 the two divisions of AoK produced 5.5 Mt of bauxite: 5.11 Mt from nine operating open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.4 Mt from three operating open pits at TBRU.
The TBRU mining contract expires on 21 January 2017, the mining contract for KBRUs Vostochno-Ayatskoye expires on 26 July 2031 and the mining contract for the remaining KBRU deposits Ayatskoye, Belinsky and Krasnogorsky has recently been prolonged until 21 January 2042.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life of mine plans.
The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for AoK to the end of 2045.
SRK notes that the economic viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU.
Energy Division EEC Coal Vostochny open pit coal mine produced 20.1 Mt of coal in 2011.
The current mining contract expires on 18 March 2022.
The Coal Reserves are based on a life of mine plan up to 2046 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the contract under similar terms for a period that matches the life of mine plan.
The Coal Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2046.

com Other Non-ferrous Division Boss Mining and SMKK Copper Cobalt ores In line with last years Annual Report, SRK has reviewed four of ENRCs copper-cobalt deposits located in the DRC, which ENRC acquired through its majority shareholding in Central African Mining and Exploration Ltd CAMEC in 2009 and through the acquisition of Socit Minire fide Kabolela et Kipese Sprl SMKK in 2009 and 2010.
The deposits reviewed and visited by SRK in February 2012 are: Kakanda North, Kakanda South, Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela.
The original estimates were undertaken by international mining consultants, Coffey Mining.
Mineral Resources for four additional deposits are included in this years statement: Saafi, Chimbedia, Kavundi and Taratara.
The original estimates for these deposits were undertaken by Deswik.
No Ore Reserves are stated for any deposits and current production is undertaken according to an internal mine plan.
SRK notes, that whilst mining takes place on the Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela deposits, the current resource models are effectively exploration models.
Because of this, as well as challenges regarding grade control, reconciliation with production figures is problematic.
This is a significant issue which ENRC is engaged in resolving in the short term through: Upgrading the resource models, starting with Kakanda.
The services of AMEC have been secured in this regard: and Improving grade control and metal accounting.
All Mineral Resources are presented on a 100% attributable basis.
