The assumptions used in the model are as follows: LTIP LTIP 2011 2010 Exercise price nil nil Risk-free interest rate 1% n a Discount in respect of dividend yield 0% 0% Volatility of share price 39.0% 39.8% Share price at grant date: 19 06 2009 546.0p 546.0p 21 06 2010 698.5p Expected term 3 years from 3 years from grant date grant date Volatility was determined based on the movement in the share price over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the period over which the TSR condition applies, which equates to a three-year share price history 2010: a three-year share price history.
The fair value of share plans involving market performance conditions takes into account market information.
The discount in respect of the dividend yield is set to zero where it is assumed that the Remuneration Committee will, at its discretion, award participants with the value of dividends accrued over the vesting period.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the Monte Carlo model simulates TSR for the Company and a comparator group.
In 2011 and 2010 the comparator group consisted of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The model takes into account historic dividends and share price volatilities for the Company and the comparator group to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
Awards that do not contain market performance conditions are valued at market value at date of award and discounted in the event that the award does not benefit from dividends during the vesting period.
These awards are also adjusted where the vesting likelihood of any applicable non-market performance condition being satisfied is deemed, subject to prudent assessment, to require a vesting adjustment.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 685.14 pence 2010: 528.06 pence.
