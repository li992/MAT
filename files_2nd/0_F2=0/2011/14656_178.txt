Interest rate swaps The Group has taken out various interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Spirit Issuer plc Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.581% to March 2012 and 6.831% thereafter on the Class A1 and Class A2 debenture notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4 and Class A5 debenture notes.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Although these swaps ensure that cash flows are perfectly hedged over the life of the notes they were deemed ineffective at the time of the 2006 acquisition of the Group by the Punch group, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39, and accordingly all future movements in fair value will be recognised in the income statement.
