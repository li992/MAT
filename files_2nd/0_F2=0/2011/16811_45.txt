Pay and performance for the 2012 financial year The Remuneration Committee considers the remuneration increases for the different groups of employees across all of our local markets and other relevant factors when assessing the pay of the executive directors.
During its regular review of total compensation in March 2011, the Remuneration Committee decided that due to an improvement in business performance, with a return to revenue growth, and continued focus on profit and strong cash flow, that modest salary increases for the executive directors would be appropriate.
Individual increases will become effective from 1 July 2011 and are set out in the table on page 67.
When determining these increases the Remuneration Committee took into account the general increases in each of the major markets.
It should be noted that the average increase for the executive directors is 2.8% and for the whole of the Executive Committee it is 3% which is in line with increases in the rest of the Group based in the UK.
Details of the GSTIP The short-term incentive plan rewards performance over the one year operating cycle.
This plan consists of four performance measures, three of which are financial measures with the fourth being an assessment of our competitive performance including market share performance relative to our competitors measured by revenue and profit, as well as customer endorsement and satisfaction measured by net promoter score.
Each performance measure has an individual weighting which is reviewed each year to ensure alignment with our strategy.
In the table below we describe our achievement against each of the performance measures and the resulting total incentive payout level for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Performance achievement Between Between threshold target and Above Performance measure Weighting Below threshold and target maximum maximum Service revenue 30% Profit 20% Cash flow 20% Competitive performance assessment 30% Total incentive payout level 124.2% Changes to the GSTIP in 2012 For the 2012 financial year the framework for our annual incentive plan will remain the same as in 2011.
However, to emphasise our focus on profitable growth we have rebalanced the weightings for service revenue and profit so the two measures are equally weighted.
As a result, the split of weightings for our performance measures for the 2012 financial year will be: Service revenue 25%: Profit earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation 25%: Free cash flow 20%: and Competitive performance assessment 30%.
We believe these measures continue to support our strategy by capturing our underlying operational performance, and our performance as viewed by our customers and in relation to our competition.
66 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration continued Details of the GLTI The first award under the current GLTI plan was made in July 2008 2009 financial year and will vest in July 2011.
Details of how the plan works are included in the table on page 64.
The extent to which awards vest depend on two performance conditions: underlying operational performance as measured by free cash flow: and relative TSR against a peer group median.
Free cash flow The free cash flow performance is based on a three year cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure.
The definition of adjusted free cash flow is reported free cash flow excluding: Verizon Wireless additional distributions: the impact of any mergers, acquisitions and disposals: certain material one-off tax settlements: and foreign exchange rate movements over the performance period.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow target and range for awards in the 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial years are shown in the table below: Vesting 2012 2011 2010 2009 Performance percentage bn bn bn bn Threshold 50% 16.70 18.00 15.50 15.50 Target 100% 19.20 20.50 18.00 17.50 Superior 150% 20.45 21.75 19.25 18.50 Maximum 200% 21.70 23.00 20.50 19.50 The target free cash flow level is set by reference to the Companys three year plan and market expectations.
The Remuneration Committee considers the targets to be critical to the Companys long-term success and its ability to maximise shareholder value, and to be in line with the strategic goals of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee also considers these targets to be sufficiently demanding with significant stretch where only outstanding performance will be rewarded with a maximum payout.
TSR out-performance of a peer group median We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile.
As such, the out-performance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure.
The peer group for the performance condition for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial years is: BT Group: Deutsche Telekom: France Telecom: Telecom Italia: Telefonica: and Emerging market composite consists of the average TSR performance of Bharti, MTN and Turkcell.
The relative TSR position will determine the performance multiplier.
This will be applied to the free cash flow vesting percentage.
There will be no multiplier until TSR performance exceeds median.

Combined vesting matrix The combination of the two performance measures gives a combined vesting matrix as follows: TSR performance Free cash flow measure Up to median 65th 80th Threshold 50% 75% 100% Target 100% 150% 200% Superior 150% 225% 300% Maximum 200% 300% 400% The combined vesting percentages are applied to the target number of shares granted.
Governance Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2011 67 Performance shares vesting in 2011 Adjusted free cash flow for the three year period ended on 31 March 2011 was 16.9 billion and the graph below shows our TSR performance against our peer group for the same period resulted in an outperformance of the median by 3.9%.
Using the matrix above, this results in a payout of 30.6% of the maximum.
These shares will vest in July 2011.
The free cash flow performance is approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance assessment in respect of the TSR out-performance of a peer group median is undertaken by pwc.
