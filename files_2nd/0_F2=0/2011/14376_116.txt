10 Investments Accounting policy Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs on the trade date.
The Group has aninvestment in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their very nature have no xed maturity date or coupon rate.
The investment is classed as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.
The fair value of the investment is based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market: non-marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price, prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value.
The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired.
Any objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities, whereupon an impairment is recognised as an expense immediately.
