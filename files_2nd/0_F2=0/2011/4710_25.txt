New accounting policies a Adopted by the group The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the group with no impact on its consolidated results or financial position: Amendment to IAS 1 Classification of the liability component of a convertible instrument Amendment to IAS 7 Classification of expenditures on unrecognised assets Amendment to IAS 17 Classification of leases of land and buildings Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation Classification of rights issues Amendment to IAS 36 Cash generating units Amendments to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement Amendment to IFRS 2 Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions Amendments to IFRS 3 Business combinations Amendment to IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Amendment to IFRS 8 Segment information with respect to total assets IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments b Not adopted by the group The following standards, amendments and interpretations, issued by the IASB or IFRIC and endorsed by the EU, unless stated otherwise, have not yet been adopted by the group.
Unless stated otherwise, the standards or interpretations do not have to be adopted by the group until the year ending 30 June 2014 though the group may determine to adopt them earlier.
The group does not currently believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the group unless stated otherwise.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments not yet endorsed by the EU removes the multiple classification and measurement models for financial assets required by IAS 39 and introduces a model that has only two classification categories: amortised cost and fair value.
Classification is driven by the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.
The accounting and presentation for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial instruments is relocated from IAS 39 without any significant changes.
The group is currently assessing the impact this standard would have on its consolidated results and financial position of the group.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements not yet endorsed by the EU replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and SIC - 12 Consolidation special purpose entities.
The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity remains unchanged, as do the mechanics of consolidation.
IFRS 1 1 Joint arrangements not yet endorsed by the EU requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture depending on the rights and obligations of each party to the arrangement.
Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and equity accounting will be mandatory.
It is anticipated that the application of the standard will result in an immaterial decrease in net sales, total assets and total liabilities of the group but have no impact on the groups net profit or net assets.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities not yet endorsed by the EU requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and financial effects associated with the groups interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structured entities.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement not yet endorsed by the EU explains how to measure fair value and aims to enhance fair value disclosures.
The standard does not change the measurement of fair value but codifies it in one place.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits not yet endorsed by the EU changes a number of disclosure requirements for post employment arrangements and restricts the options currently available on how to account for defined benefit pension plans.
The most significant change that will impact the group is that the amendment requires the expected returns on pension plan assets, currently calculated based on managements estimate of expected returns to be replaced by a credit on the pension plan assets calculated at the liability discount rate.
The group expects this change will result in an increase in finance costs but will not impact the groups net assets.

In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the UK Scheme the largest plan is based on the 114 Consolidated mortality experience of that plan.
The mortality assumption is based on the CMI birth year tables with scaling factors based on the balance sheet experience of the plan.

Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes to the consolidated 131 financial statements Within the plan assets above there is no investment in the ordinary shares of Diageo plc.
Included in equities in the UK plans at 30 June 2011 are 324 million 2010 356 million: 2009 391 million invested in hedge funds and 285 million 2010 247 million: 2009 191 million invested in private equity.
Included in other assets at 30 June 2011 are interest rate and inflation swaps, along with repurchase agreements for the UK plans, with a fair value gain in the UK plans of 173 million 2010 51 million gain: 2009 46 million loss and a fair value loss in the Irish plans of 18 million 2010 61 million gain: 2009 11 million gain.
The asset classes include some cash holdings that are temporary.
This cash is likely to be invested in the relevant asset class imminently and so has been included in the asset class where it is anticipated to be invested in the long term.
UK plan assets include temporary cash of 43 million 2010 27 million: 2009 35 million in equities, 74 million 2010 36 million: 2009 152 million in bonds and 5 million 2010 30 million: 2009 11 million in property.
Irish plan assets include temporary cash of 11 million 2010 10 million: 2009 7 million in equities and 26 million 2010 105 million: 2009 64 million in bonds.
Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an individual plan is in surplus or deficit, as follows: 2011 2010 million million Non-current assets 60 49 Non-current liabilities 898 1,254 838 1,205 The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2011, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 4% per year 2010 and 2009 4% in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The investment strategy for the groups funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustee of the plan and or Diageo, as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the movement on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual equity exposures.
At 30 June 2011, approximately 33% 2010 33%: 2009 40% of the UK Schemes liabilities and approximately 37% 2010 38%: 2009 40% of the Irish Schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation through the use of swaps.
The discount rate is based on the yields of high quality, fixed income investments.
For the UK pension plans, which represent approximately 65% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is determined by reference to the yield curves of AA rated corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows are similar to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.

During the year ended 30 June 2011 whisky inventory with a book value of 535 million as at 30 June 2011 was transferred into the partnership.
The group retains control over the partnership and therefore this inventory, including the flexibility to substitute alternative inventories, and the partnership is fully consolidated within the group financial statements.
The UK Scheme acquired a limited interest in the partnership, and as a partner, is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership each year for 14 years.
This profit share is expected to be approximately 25 million per annum.
In 2024 the group will be required, dependent upon the funding position of the UK Scheme at that time, to pay an amount expected to be no greater than the deficit at that time, up to a maximum of 430 million in cash, to the UK Scheme to buyout the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
Under IAS 19 Employee benefits the interest in the partnership does not represent a plan asset for group reporting purposes and therefore the UK Schemes deficit position presented in these financial statements does not reflect the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
Accordingly, distributions from the partnership to the UK Scheme are reflected in the consolidated group financial statements on a cash basis as contributions are paid.
The group has also agreed to make conditional contributions into escrow of up to 338 million if an equivalent reduction in the deficit is not achieved over the 10 year term of the funding plan.
The escrow account would be payable to the UK Scheme after the triennial funding trustee valuations.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service costs based on the UK Scheme trustees valuation.
This contribution is expected to be 50 million to the UK Scheme for the year ending 30 June 2012.

This agreement results in the group contributing 21 million 19 million per annum over an 18 year period from 2010.
The first contribution was made in the year ended 30June 2011.
The agreement also provides for additional cash contributions into escrow of up to 188 million 169 million if an equivalent reduction in the deficit is not achieved over the 18 year period.
As part of this funding plan, Diageo has granted to the Irish Scheme a contingent asset comprising mortgages over certain land and buildings and fixed and floating charges over certain receivables of the group up to a value of 200 million 180 million.
In addition to the deficit funding the group expects to make cash contributions of 27 million 23 million to the Irish Scheme in the year ending 30 June 2012.

At 30 June 2011, the principal acquired brands, all of which are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, are as follows: 2011 2010 Carrying amount of acquired brands Principal markets million million Johnnie Walker whisky Global 625 625 Smirnoff vodka Global 512 550 Captain Morgan Global 746 801 Crown Royal whisky United States 909 976 Windsor Premier whisky Korea 506 475 Bells whisky Great Britain 179 179 Cacique rum Spain 190 173 Seagrams 7 Crown whiskey United States 139 149 Bushmills whiskey United States 144 144 Seagrams VO whisky United States 118 127 Gordons gin Great Britain 119 119 Old Parr whisky Venezuela 111 109 Tanqueray gin United States 74 79 Bundaberg rum Australia 90 76 Nuvo liqueur United States 58 62 Romana Sambuca liqueur United States 53 57 White Horse whisky Russia 53 53 Ursus vodka Greece United States 37 Other brands 179 179 4,805 4,970 Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and are therefore not amortised.
These brands are protected by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely, in all of the major markets where they are sold.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
b For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to cash-generating units as follows: 2011 2010 million million North America United States 204 224 Europe Ireland 45 46 Southern Europe 72 66 Russia and Eastern Europe 43 42 International Africa 38 10 Other cash-generating units 16 12 418 400 Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions of businesses and distribution rights and includes synergies arising from cost savings and the opportunity to utilise the groups distribution network to leverage marketing of the acquired products.
c Other intangibles comprise principally distribution rights.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, Diageo acquired the global distribution rights in perpetuity for Ketel One vodka products, and the directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as having an indefinite life for accounting purposes.
The carrying value at 30 June 2011 was 1,118 million 2010 1,200 million.
All other distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years, unless there is an indication that the asset may be impaired, in which case, if necessary, the asset is written down or the amortisation period is reassessed and changed.
Amortisation of other intangible assets is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
d Computer software includes 71 million 2010 65 million in respect of projects in the course of development.
Amortisation of computer software is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.
Impairment testing To ensure that brands, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not carried at above their recoverable amount, impairment reviews are performed comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount using value in use calculations.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated in respect of the cash-generating unit including the attributed goodwill.
These calculations are performed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash flows and terminal values calculated on the assumption that cash flows continue in perpetuity at the long term growth rate of each country or region.
Diageo Annual Report 2011 142 Financial statements 11.
Intangible assets continued Cash flows are forecast for each brand, other intangible and cash-generating unit for the next financial year in the groups annual financial plan, which is approved by the board and reflects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
The discount rates used are calculated as the groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment where necessary to reflect the groups assessment of the specific risks relating to the relevant market or region.
The long term growth rates applied at the end of the forecast period are taken as the real gross domestic product GDP growth rate of the country or region plus its inflation rate, based on a five-year average adjusted to take into account expectations specific to the group.
For goodwill, these assumptions are based on the cash-generating unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated.
For brands, they are based on a weighted average taking into account the country or countries where sales are generated.
For the Ketel One vodka distribution rights, a discount rate of 10% 2010 10% and a long term growth rate of 3.4% 2010 3.4% have been used.
Financial statements For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth, driven by Diageos sales, marketing and 111 distribution expertise, which is in excess of the long term growth rates for the applicable countries or regions.
In these circumstances, Auditors report in the cash flow forecast is extended beyond the next financial year by up to four years using a detailed plan.
respect of the Group The pre-tax discount rates and long term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: 112 Consolidated 2011 2010 income statement Pre-tax Long term Pre-tax Long term 113 discount growth discount growth Consolidated rate rate rate rate statement of % % % % comprehensive Global brands 12 4.9 12 4.9 income North America United States 13 3.4 13 3.4 114 Consolidated Europe Great Britain 12 4.5 13 4.6 balance sheet Ireland 15 2.9 9 2.9 115 Spain 15 2.9 14 2.9 Consolidated statement of Greece 25 1.8 19 1.8 changes in equity Southern Europe 20 2.4 18 2.9 116 Russia 19 9.5 18 9.5 Consolidated statement of Eastern Europe 18 9.0 17 8.4 cash flows International Venezuela 67 28.7 74 30.3 117 Africa 25 11.7 29 12.0 Accounting policies of the group Asia Pacific Australia 14 4.5 13 4.5 Korea 13 7.1 13 7.1 121 Notes to the consolidated Any impairment writedowns identified are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
In the year ended financial statements 30 June 2011, an impairment loss of 39 million 2010 35 million: 2009 nil was charged to other operating expenses in respect 174 of the Ursus brand.
Auditors report in respect of the The discount rate for Greece used by the group for impairment calculations was further increased due to a deterioration in the countrys company sovereign risk rating and the long term growth assumptions for Ursus were reduced due to a fall in demand which has resulted in a full 175 impairment of the brand value.
Company balance sheet Sensitivity to change in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, in particular 176 in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows and the expected long term growth rates.
Accounting policies of the company The table below shows the impairment charge that would be required if the assumptions in the calculation of their value in use 178 were changed: Notes to the 1ppt 1ppt 5% company financial increase decrease in decrease in statements in discount long term annual rate growth rate cash flows million million million Brands Bushmills 6 2 Cacique 4 16 28 It remains possible that changes in assumptions could arise in excess of those indicated in the table above.
Goodwill allocated to the Southern Europe cash-generating unit would be impaired in case of an increase in discount rate of 1.5ppt, decrease in long term growth rate of 1.4ppt and fall in annual cash flows of 8.2%.
For all intangibles with an indefinite life, other than the brands in the table above and the goodwill allocated to the Southern Europe cash-generating unit, management has concluded that no reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amounts would cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.

income statement The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed by the groups treasury 113 department.
The treasury department uses a range of financial instruments to manage these underlying risks.
Consolidated Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and statement of comprehensive subsequently monitored by the finance committee.
This committee is described in the Corporate governance report.
These policies income and guidelines include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover and 114 overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, Consolidated strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal balance sheet application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions arising on the application of this flexibility may give rise to exposures 115 different from the defined benchmark levels that are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.

statement of cash flows a Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign 117 Accounting policies currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the groups of the group transactions and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
To manage the foreign exchange risk 121 the groups treasury department uses certain financial instruments.
Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and Notes to the tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Diageo expects hedges entered into to continue to be effective and therefore does consolidated financial statements not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the consolidated income statement to be material.
174 Auditors report in Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the sterling respect of the value of its foreign operations by designating net borrowings held in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency spots, forwards, company swaps and other financial derivatives.
The board reviewed and approved a revised policy, applicable from 3 December 2010, to manage 175 hedging of foreign exchange risk arising from net investment in foreign operations.
The groups revised policy is, where a liquid foreign Company balance sheet exchange market exists, to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations by using gross debt in foreign currencies and foreign currency spots, forwards, swaps and other financial derivatives within the following percentage bands: 80% to 176 Accounting policies 100% for US dollars and euros and, at managements discretion, 0% to 100% for other currencies.
The groups previous policy where of the company a liquid foreign exchange market existed, was to aim to hedge currency exposure on its net investment in foreign operations by using 178 net debt in foreign currencies and foreign currency spots, forwards swaps and other financial derivatives and within the following Notes to the percentage bands: 80% to 100% for US dollars and euros and 50% to 100% for other currencies.
As at 30 June 2011, these ratios were company financial statements 89% and 87% for US dollars and euros, respectively, and 42% for other currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency forwards swaps and other financial derivatives, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in other comprehensive income to offset exchange differences on net investments in foreign operations.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not in a hedge relationship and any ineffectiveness are taken to the income statement.
Transaction exposure hedging The board reviewed the groups transactional foreign exchange risk management policy and approved a revised policy, on 1 October 2010.
The groups revised policy is to aim to hedge 18 months forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk in the three major currency pairs US dollar sterling, euro sterling and euro US dollar, up to 100%, with a target range of between 75% and 100% once the relevant annual plan has been approved.
In addition, at managements discretion, the group may decide to hedge other currencies for up to 18 months.
The groups previous policy was to seek, for currencies in which there was an active market, to hedge between 60% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using foreign currency forward contracts with coverage levels increasing nearer to the forecast transaction date.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement.
Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes to the consolidated 151 financial statements Hedge of foreign currency debt The group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated borrowings.
At 30 June 2011, as a result of the net investment, transaction exposure and foreign currency debt cover outlined above, the group had outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in note 23 g. Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in currency rates is reported in the Market risk sensitivity analysis in note 23 d. b Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fixed and floating rate borrowing and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices aim to minimise the groups net finance charges with acceptable year on year volatility.
To facilitate operational efficiency and effective hedge accounting, the groups policy is to maintain fixed rate borrowings within a band of 40% to 60% of forecast net borrowings.
For these calculations, net borrowings exclude interest rate related fair value adjustments.
A template approved by the board specifies different duration guidelines and fixed floating amortisation periods time taken for the fixed element of debt to reduce to zero depending on different interest rate environments.
The majority of Diageos existing interest rate derivatives are designated as hedges and are expected to be effective.
Fair value of these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.
c Commodity price risk The group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The group primarily uses long term purchase contracts to secure prices with suppliers to protect against volatility in commodity prices.
d Market risk sensitivity analysis The group is using a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% 50 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, for each class of financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liability and corporate tax payable.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Financial instruments are valued at the balance sheet date using discounted cash flow techniques.
Changes in interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments.
Changes in interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at fair value.
Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using rates prevailing at the year end.
All interest rate, net investment and foreign currency cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective.
The sensitivity analysis estimates the impact of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Actual results in the future may differ from these results materially due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as projections of likely future events, gains or losses.
Reasonably possible hypothetical changes in other risk variables would not significantly affect the fair value of financial instruments at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010.

balance sheet Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business related credit exposures.
115 Consolidated statement of Financial credit risk changes in equity Diageo aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the 116 board.
Counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty Consolidated by setting credit limits taking into account the credit quality of the counterparty.
The groups policy is designed to ensure that individual statement of cash flows counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The board also defines the types of 117 financial instruments which may be transacted.
Financial instruments are primarily transacted with major international financial Accounting policies institutions with a long term credit rating within the A band or better.
The credit risk arising through the use of financial instruments for of the group interest rate and currency risk management is estimated with reference to the fair value of contracts with a positive value, rather than 121 the notional amount of the instruments themselves.
Notes to the When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, Diageo may, where appropriate, enter into certain consolidated financial statements agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net 174 valuations of the derivatives are above a pre-determined threshold.

At 30 June 2011, approximately 13% and 17% of the groups trade receivables of 1,501 million are due from counterparties based in the United Kingdom and in the United States, respectively.
f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Diageo may encounter in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets.
The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
Amounts are shown on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, rates of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve at the last business day of the years ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010.
Finance lease liabilities at 30 June 2011 of 126 million include interest of 47 million 2010 finance lease liabilities of 116 million including interest of 55 million.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2011 2010 million million Expiring within one year 776 920 Expiring between one and two years 727 833 Expiring after two years 671 780 2,174 2,533 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities and accounted for on an accruals basis.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates dependent on the period of drawdown plus an agreed margin.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the groups short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits after tax, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial, pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants throughout each of the years presented.

The levels can be broadly described as follows: Level 1 use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets: and Level 3 use of inputs not based on observable market data but reflecting managements own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability.
The group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available.
If multiple inputs that fall into different levels of the hierarchy are used in the valuation of an instrument, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the most subjective input.
Derivatives and other financial liabilities at fair value Foreign currency forwards and swaps, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques.
These techniques incorporate inputs at levels 1 and 2, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
These market inputs are used in the discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instruments term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account.
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in the markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy.
The Nolet Groups option to sell the remaining 50% equity stake in Ketel One Worldwide BV to Diageo is classified as a derivative financial liability with changes in fair value included in operating profit.
As the valuation of the option uses assumptions not observable in the market, it is categorised as a level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy.
The groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding finance lease liabilities, measured at fair value are categorised as follows: 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total million million million million million million million million Assets Derivative assets 394 394 570 570 Total assets 394 394 570 570 Liabilities Derivative liabilities 118 15 133 229 23 252 Other financial liabilities 25 25 28 28 Total liabilities 118 40 158 229 51 280 Diageo Annual Report 2011 156 Financial statements 23.

178 Notes to the company financial statements Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes to the consolidated 157 financial statements All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as trading derivatives with fair value changes recorded in the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are initially undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The fair values of borrowings are based on market data.
The fair values of derivatives and financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using the appropriate yield curves at the last business day of the years ended 30 June each year.
As at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, other financial assets and liabilities were considered to approximate fair values.
Fair value hedging relationships Certain borrowings due within and after one year are part of qualifying fair value interest rate hedging relationships.
Accordingly, there is a fair value adjustment for these liabilities with respect to the hedged interest rate risk, with changes being recognised in the income statement, as disclosed in note 23 g. The group has not designated any non-derivative financial assets or liabilities at fair value.

a A provision was established in the year ended 30 June 2005 in respect of the discounted value of the groups commitment to the UK Thalidomide Trust, and will be utilised over the period of the commitment up to 2037.
An additional provision of 24 million was created in the year ended 30 June 2010 in respect of anticipated future payments to new thalidomide claimants.
It is expected that the additional provision will be utilised over the period of the commitment, up to 2030. b Included in provision for onerous contracts at 30 June 2010 was 68 million in respect of the discounted value of an onerous supply contract arising on the acquisition of the Seagram spirits and wine business on 21 December 2001.
This provision is being utilised over the 10-year duration of the contract.
The provision includes a termination amount which will be payable in the seven months ending 31 January 2012.
The amount payable of 51 million at 30 June 2011 has been included in other payables.
c The group is undergoing a number of restructuring programmes, which involve the rationalisation of operations around the world.
Employee charges, incremental costs in respect of service contract and information systems infrastructure charges in connection with the programmes are recognised in the restructuring provision, which is expected to be substantially utilised in the year ending 30 June 2012. d The vacant property provision is based on the estimated discounted rental shortfall over the terms of the leases up to 2031. e Other provisions include 42 million 2010 47 million in respect of employee deferred compensation plans which will be utilised when employees leave or retire from the company.

The group benefits from the availability of tax amortisation on many of its principal brands and other intangible assets.
In the year ended 30 June 2011 a combination of strong performance and positive forward outlook led to the recognition of an increase in the deferred tax assets of 115 million 2010 nil in respect of future amortisation.
A proportion of the groups deferred tax assets arise from future tax amortisation deductions and these are currently subject to negotiations with tax authorities.
The outcome of these negotiations could be a favourable change in taxation basis that replaces the benefit of future amortisation resulting in a write off the related deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets of 107 million 2010 187 million have been recognised in jurisdictions which made prior year taxable losses.
It is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to support recognition of these deferred tax assets due to a reduction in future interest charges in those jurisdictions.
Financial statements 111 Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not Auditors report in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
