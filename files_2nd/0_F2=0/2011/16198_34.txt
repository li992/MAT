com Notes to the Group financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 h Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of that standard, only those awards that were granted after 7 November 2002, and had not vested at 1 January 2005, are included.
All share-based awards of the Company are equity settled as defined by FRS 20.
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Companys estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using a binomial option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee turnover after vesting and early exercise.
Where necessary this model was supplemented with a Monte Carlo model.
The inputs to the models include: the share price at date of grant: exercise price: expected volatility: expected dividends: risk free rate of interest: and patterns of exercise of the plan participants.
i Capital management The Company defines capital as the total equity of the Company.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, and put in place new debt facilities.

com Notes to the Group financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment.
The net assets of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation E&E assets.
Where facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount.
The recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test of the investment carrying value needs to be performed.
The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the assessment for impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.

Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR and sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $650 million Revolving Credit Facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2014.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2011, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $826 million: $176 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $650 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2010, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $685 million: $175 million under the $2.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $510 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
com Notes to the Group financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 Note 6.
Bank loans continued The Company is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2011 was $7.2 million out of the money 2010: $13.6 million out of the money.
The interest rate hedges are included in the fixed rate debt in the above table.
The carrying amounts of the Companys foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $163.8 million 2010: net liabilities of $164.0 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Company is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US dollar.
The Company measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjust their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2011, a 20% increase in foreign exchange rates against the US dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities of $27.3 million 2010: $27.3 million and a 20% decrease in foreign exchange rates against the US dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $32.8 million 2010: $32.8 million.

Share-based payments continued UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs These are all-employee plans set up in the UK and Ireland, to enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the Plan trustees to buy Tullow shares Partnership Shares at the end of each three-month accumulation period.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-forone basis.
Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value at the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date which is treated as a three-month share option for FRS 20 purposes.
For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date which does not result in any FRS 20 accounting charge.
Matching Shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Company recognised a total charge of $0.6 million 2010: $0.2 million for the UK SIP Plan and $0.2 million 2010: $0.2 million for the Irish SIP plan.
