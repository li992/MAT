FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
OPERATING SEGMENTS During 2011, the Group was organised into three operating segments the UK, International and Emerging Markets.
The UK is the Groups country of domicile and one of its principal markets.
International comprised operations in Scandinavia, Canada, Ireland and Italy and Emerging Markets comprises the Groups operations in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe.
All operations are engaged in providing personal and commercial general insurance services.
Central functions include the Groups internal reinsurance function and Group Corporate Centre.
This structure brought together operations with similar challenges and opportunities in order to give due focus to achieving the Groups objective of profitable growth across the business.
Each operating segment was managed by a Chief Executive Officer CEO who was directly accountable to the Group CEO and the Board of Directors.
On 11 November 2011, the Group announced changes to the Groups operating structure and Executive Team.
From 1 January 2012, the Group is organised into four regions, Scandinavia, Canada, UK & Western Europe, and Emerging Markets with each operating segment managed by a Chief Executive Officer CEO who is directly accountable to the Group CEO and the Board of Directors.
The CEOs of Scandinavia and Canada have also joined the Group Executive Committee with effect from 1 January 2012.
This new structure reflects the significant contribution that the Scandinavian and Canadian businesses make to the Groups results and will drive improved performance across the UK & Western European region, which includes Ireland and Italy.
A reconciliation of the results reported under the new operating structure to the results reported under the previous structure is included at the end of this note.
The business review is presented using the new operating structure.
The Group uses the following key measures to assess the performance of its operating segments: Net written premiums Underwriting result Combined operating ratio COR.
Net written premiums is the key measure of revenue used in internal reporting.
Underwriting result and COR are the key internal measures of profitability of the operating segments.
The COR reflects the ratio of claims costs and expenses including commission to premiums, expressed as a percentage.
As described in the Risk Management section of the notes to the financial statements sufficient net assets are maintained by each of the Groups subsidiaries to satisfy local regulatory and internal risk based capital requirements.
In addition the Group monitors the Groups total capital position at all times.
Assets and liabilities are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at the Group level, and as such are not presented at the operating segment level.
All of these items are measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Certain items included within the Groups investment result are allocated to the operating segments based on economic capital requirements.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Management basis The management basis reflects the way management monitor the business.
Operating result on a management basis comprises the underwriting result, the investment result and other activities.
Major components of underwriting result are net earned premiums, other operating income, net claims incurred, acquisition costs and other underwriting costs.
The investment result, excluding unwind of discount and foreign exchange, is disclosed as net investment return on the statutory basis.
Other activities primarily comprise administration expenses, ongoing investment in the Groups operations in Central and Eastern Europe and other expenses of 99m 2010: 102m, the Group share in the loss after tax of its associates of 9m 2010: 5m and investment expenses and charges of 34m 2010: 33m.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY The earnings per ordinary share is calculated by reference to the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders and the weighted average of shares in issue during the year.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the ESOP Trusts and Share Incentive Plan Trust and held as treasury shares.

The Parent Company has share options and contingently issuable shares as categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The calculation is performed for the dilutive potential ordinary shares to determine the number of shares that could have been issued at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Parent Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.

However, based on the information currently available, the Group does not believe that such restrictions materially impact the ability to meet obligations or pay dividends.
The trustees of the Royal & Sun Alliance ESOP Trust and the Royal & Sun Alliance ESOP Trust No 2 waived their entitlement to except for a nominal amount dividends which reduced the total dividend paid by less than 1m 2010: less than 1m.

Additions of software development comprise 9m 2010: 8m of external software and 147m 2010: 119m of internally developed software.
112 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK 21 52 International 456 359 Emerging Markets 186 239 Goodwill impairment charges of 71m 2010: Nil have been recognised within other operating expenses, split between the UK 41m and Emerging Markets 30m.
In the UK, the impairment losses impact Commercial lines and relate to the acquisitions of Martello in 2006 and Fyfe in 2008, where the Group has significantly scaled back activity in the economic downturn.
The key estimate in the measurement of the recoverable amount is the discount rate applied to calculate the net present value of future cash flows, which has been estimated as 8% as at 31 December 2011 2010: 10%.
In Emerging Markets, the impairment charges reflects slower economic growth than originally anticipated in the Czech Republic and Poland.
The key estimate assumption in determining the recoverable amount for both regions is the long-term growth rate, for which estimates of 5.1% and 6.3% in local currency for the Czech and Polish businesses respectively have been applied as at 31 December 2011 2010: 8.0% and 10.0% respectively.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Group Audit Committee.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used are within a range of 8% to 21% 2010: 9% to 15%, are pre tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2011 are within a range of 3% to 13% 2010: 2% to 5%.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group has unused tax losses of 2,128m 2010: 1,835m and unused tax credits of 15m 2010: 15m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 148m 2010: 109m has been recognised in respect of losses and unused tax credits.
In addition, the Group recognised 80m 2010: 69m in respect of other deferred tax reliefs.
These are included within other temporary 128 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS differences at 31 December 2011.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,572m 2010: 1,390m tax losses and unused tax credits of 11m 2010: 5m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses include 194m 2010: 152m which will expire between 2012 and 2031, of which 87m 2010: 71m have been recognised for deferred tax.
Other tax losses and unused credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group does not recognise deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
The temporary difference in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates is 965m 2010: 841m.
Deferred tax assets of 199m 2010: 138m, which are in excess of profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and that relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these can be utilised.
The evidence for the future taxable profits is a forecast consistent with the three year operational plans prepared by the relevant businesses, which are subject to internal review and challenge.
Where relevant, the forecast includes extrapolations of the operational plans using assumptions consistent with those used in the plans.

The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component of 0.1bn represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2011 is 0.1bn 2010: 0.3bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component is 0.1bn 2010: 0.3bn.
The insurance component is accounted for within insurance contract liabilities and the deposit component, offset by the value of the funds held in the trust account, is recognised under other liabilities.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 65m 2010: 55m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 14m 2010: 12m were paid to this scheme during 2011 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2011, when the scheme funding rate was 115% 2010: 112%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
130 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS During 2009 the Group entered into arrangements that insured 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment in the two main UK schemes.
The arrangements comprise of assets and interest rate swaps combined with an insurance contract that provide for the full payment of the pensions in return for the actual investment return on a segregated portfolio of assets held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The pension schemes continue to benefit from the assets held in the portfolio and retain the obligation to meet the insured pension obligations.
The assets and pension obligations are therefore not derecognised in the financial statements and an asset representing the recovery of the insured pension obligations and a liability to pay the investment return on the portfolio of assets to the insurer are recognised.
During 2010 changes were made to the benefit structure of the three main UK schemes.
Changes affected future accrual from 1 March 2010 onwards.
Accrual rates were reduced: the retirement age was increased: revaluation was subject to a cap of 2.5%: a cap was applied to the salary used for the defined benefit schemes and the schemes contracted back in to the State scheme.
Employees were entitled to join the Stakeholder Pension scheme for earnings above the cap.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2011 were 23% and 22% of pensionable salaries 2010: 23% and 22%.
Additional contributions totalling 51m 2010: 45m were made to the schemes, in accordance with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to pension and post retirement benefit schemes for the year ending 31 December 2012 are approximately 54m, including a further 37m of additional contributions following the funding valuation in March 2009.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.
Benefits are generally payable for life.
The estimated discounted present values of the unfunded accumulated obligations are calculated in accordance with the advice of independent, qualified actuaries.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the beginning of the reporting period and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2009, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the SAPS Light Normal base table with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
The next funding valuation is not due until 2012.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using 80% males and 60% females of the long cohort improvements.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.5 2010: 27.5 years males and 28.1 2010: 28.1 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.3 2010: 28.3 years males and 28.7 2010: 28.7 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
In 2010 and 2011, the Group followed the funding valuation assumptions, and an allowance was made for future commutation using the current commutation factors.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 55m 2010: 48m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 51m 2010: 44m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations net of tax in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by approximately 84m 2010: 65m.
The Group has no material exposure to the effect of changes in medical costs.
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION The Group has four types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plan SAYE, the Sharebuild Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within Association of British Insurers limits.
Further information on the LTIP scheme is included below and information on the other share schemes can be found in the remuneration report.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans is 9m in 2011 2010: 28m.
Analysis of share scheme costs per income statement : 2011 2010 m m LTIP 4 22 SAYE 4 5 Sharebuild 1 1 Total 9 28 The value of the awards granted during 2011 is 25m 2010 : 35m of which 6m 2010: 8m is charged in the income statement.

Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
Compulsory Deferred Shares awards are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2.5:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Further information on the LTIP can be found in the remuneration report within the corporate governance section.
Further disclosures in respect of the SAYE and Sharebuild schemes have not been made on the grounds that the schemes are immaterial to the Group.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group designates certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options as hedging instruments against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign exchange risk exposure.
For forward foreign exchange contracts, on designation, the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
For foreign exchange options the hedge designation is to hedge the value of the foreign operation at the strike price at the exercise date of the option.
The fair value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2011 are a liability of 12m 2010: 39m and an asset of 14m 2010: nil.
The hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement during 2011 is nil 2010: nil.
Further information on derivatives, including those designated as hedging instruments, can be found in the risk management section.

The fair value of the financial assets acquired, included within other assets, includes premiums and insurance debtors of 32m, a reduction of 1m on their nominal value to take account of balances that are expected to be uncollectable.
Deferred consideration includes consideration which is contingent on the financial performance of the acquired business.
The fair value of this consideration is estimated at 5m, with the minimum possible payment being nil and the maximum possible payment being 26m.
During 2011 there were no significant changes in the recognised amounts of contingent consideration, and no changes in the range of outcomes, in respect of business combinations completed in earlier years.
Acquisition related costs for acquisitions concluded during the period included in other operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011 amounted to 2m.
On acquisition of Proteccion Garantizada LTDA, the Group recognised 4m of non controlling interests.
The non controlling interest was measured as the proportionate share of the identifiable acquired net assets.
138 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2011, the contribution to the Groups net written premiums and fee income for the year would have been 132m and the contribution to the Groups profit after tax for the year would have been 20m.
The total net written premiums and fee income of the acquired businesses since the acquisition dates included in the Groups net written premiums for the year is 117m.
The total profit after tax of the acquired businesses since the acquisition dates included in the Groups profit for the year is 16m.
The goodwill shown above primarily arises from the premium paid to strengthen the Groups Commercial proposition in Canada by adding further technical expertise, geographic diversification and product breadth.
Goodwill is further derived from the value of the workforces acquired, the growth from new customers and the significant synergies from reinsurance, capital and expense savings on integration into the Group.
Of the total goodwill recognised, 15m is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Disposal of subsidiaries Disposals completed during the period resulted in a profit to the Group of 1m.
The total consideration received in cash was 10m and the cash and cash equivalents included in the businesses sold was 4m.
The values of other assets and liabilities disposed were not significant to the Group.
