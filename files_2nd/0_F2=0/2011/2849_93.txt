Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups Cash-Generating Units CGUs.
All goodwill relates to Industrial Services.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill are allocated by CGU as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK 18.7 16.2 Gulf Middle East 47.3 47.3 Asia 20.5 20.5 CIS 6.1 6.1 Australia 153.8 150.3 246.4 240.4 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are: 2011 2010 United Gulf Middle United Gulf Middle Kingdom East Australia Asia CIS Kingdom East Australia Asia CIS Terminal growth rate 3.0% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 3.0% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% Average five-year growth rate 7.6% 7.5% 18.9% -2.1% 2.6% 7.6% 6.5% 17.6% 18.4% 2.3% Discount rate 9.0% 9.7% 11.6% 9.5% 9.6% 11.0% 11.2% 11.7% 11.3% 11.4% Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates.
Management determined growth rates over the next five years based on internal forecasts that were derived from detailed analysis on future prospects combined with the secured order book for the relevant CGU.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant CGU.
Average five-year growth rate for Asia is negative -2.1% due to the budgeted completion of a number of key projects in the region.
Following this budgeted decrease, revenue growth for years 2013-2016 continues at a four-year average growth rate of 7.7%.

Risk premium is calculated based on a consistent long-term average return on shares and updated for any significant changes at each year end.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
The Directors have concluded that in the case of the UK, Asia, CIS and Gulf Middle East goodwill there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of Cape Australia, it is reasonably possible that a change in key assumptions could occur which would lead the carrying value to exceed the value in use.
The recoverable amount exceeds carrying value by 168.4 million.
If the average five-year growth rate assumption used in the model was changed to 8.2% respectively then carrying amount and value in use would be equal.
Key assumptions to reasonably possible change CGU Recoverable amount in excess of carrying amount Reasonably possible change leading to nil excess Australia 168.4m Decrease from 18.9% to 8.2% Average five-year growth rate
