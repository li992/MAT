Market risk The group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house price movements relating to the CHARM portfolio.
The approach the group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fair values IFRS 7 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities value at fair value.
These are as follows: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identified assets and liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly as derived from prices: and Level 3 inputs for assets and liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps are observable, they all fall within level 2.
The CHARM portfolio falls within level 3, inputs not based on observable market data.
Note 21 provides a reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income.
The basis of valuation and the sensitivity to changes in the key valuation assumptions are documented in note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
