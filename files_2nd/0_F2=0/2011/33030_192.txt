Notes on financial statements 2. significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as described on pages 76 to 79, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and contingent liabilities have been accounted for and or disclosed in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
These are discussed in further detail in Note 36 for provisions and Note 43 for contingent liabilities.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund which was established in 2010 are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds.
Key aspects of the accounting for the oil spill are summarized below.
The financial impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash ow statement of the group are shown in the table below.
Amounts related to the trust fund are separately identied.

The PSC acts on behalf of individual and business plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation proceedings pending in New Orleans MDL 2179.
Under the proposed settlement, class members would release and dismiss their claims against BP.
The proposed settlement is not an admission of liability by BP.
The proposed settlement is an adjusting event after the reporting period and therefore has been reected in the financial statements for 2011 included in this report.
The proposed settlement has not resulted in any increase in the $37.2 billion net pre-tax charge previously recorded in the financial statements.
BP estimates that the cost of the proposed settlement, which covers Individual and Business Claims and associated costs that are expected to be paid from the $20-billion trust fund, would be approximately $7.8 billion.
This represents an increase of $2.1 billion in the provision compared to the amount reected in the fourth quarter 2011 preliminary results announcement, with no net impact to either the income statement or cash ow statement, since it is expected to be payable from the trust fund see below for information on accounting for the trust fund.
The increase in provision of $2.1 billion has been recognized along with a corresponding increase of $2.1 billion in the reimbursement asset.
The amount that can further be provided with no net impact to the income statement is therefore reduced from approximately $5.5 billion to approximately $3.4 billion.
While this is BPs reliable best estimate of the cost of the proposed settlement, it is possible that the actual cost could be higher or lower than this estimate depending on the outcomes of the court-supervised claims processes.
It is not possible at this time to determine whether the $20-billion trust fund will be sufficient to cover the total amounts payable under the proposed settlement and other claims covered by the trust fund.
The proposed settlement is comprised of two separate agreements: one to resolve economic loss claims and another to resolve medical claims.
Each proposed agreement provides that the class members would be compensated for their claims on a claims-made basis according to agreed compensation protocols in separate court-supervised claims processes.
The proposed settlement contains a commitment of $2.3 billion in respect of the Gulf seafood industry.
190 190 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Financial statements Notes on financial statements 2. significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The proposed economic loss settlement provides for a transition from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility GCCF.
A court-supervised transitional claims process for economic loss claims will be in operation while the infrastructure for the new settlement claims process is put in place.
During this transitional period, the processing of claims that have been submitted to the GCCF will continue, and new claimants may submit their claims.
Costs of the proposed settlement will be paid either from the $20-billion Trust or, should the Trust not be sufficient, directly by BP.
At this time BP expects all claims to be paid from the Trust.
The proposed settlement does not include claims against BP made by the United States Department of Justice or other federal agencies including under the Clean Water Act and for Natural Resource Damages under the Oil Pollution Act or by the states and local governments.
The proposed settlement also excludes certain other claims against BP, such as securities and shareholder claims pending in MDL 2185, and claims based solely on the deepwater drilling moratorium and or the related permitting process.
The proposed settlement also provides that, to the extent permitted by law, BP will assign to the PSC certain of its claims, rights and recoveries against Transocean and Halliburton for damages with protections such that Transocean and Halliburton cannot pass those damages through to BP.
The proposed settlement is subject to reaching denitive and fully documented agreements within 45 days of 2 March 2012.
If those agreements are not reached, either party has the right to terminate the proposed settlement.
Once there are denitive and fully documented agreements, BP and the PSC would then seek the courts preliminary approval of the settlement.
Under US federal law, there is an established procedure for determining the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of class action settlements.
Pursuant to this procedure and subject to the court granting preliminary approval of both agreements, there would be an extensive outreach programme to the public to explain the settlement agreements, class members rights, including the right to opt out of the classes, and the process of making claims.
The court would then conduct fairness hearings at which class members and various other parties would have an opportunity to be heard and present evidence.
The court would then decide whether or not to approve each proposed settlement agreement.
For further details of the proposed settlement see Legal proceedings on pages 160 to 164.
Trust fund In 2010, BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust to be funded in the amount of $20 billion the trust fund over the period to the fourth quarter of 2013, which is available to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims administered by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility GCCF, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
In 2010, BP contributed $5 billion to the fund, and further regular contributions totalling $5 billion were made in 2011.
During 2011, BP also contributed the cash settlements received from MOEX, Weatherford and Anadarko, amounting in total to $5.1 billion.
A further cash settlement from Cameron was received in January 2012 and was also contributed to the trust fund.
As a result of these accelerated contributions, it is now expected that the $20-billion commitment will have been paid in full by the end of 2012.
The income statement charge for 2010 included $20 billion in relation to the trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money.
Fines, penalties and claims administration costs are not covered by the trust fund.
The establishment of the trust fund does not represent a cap or oor on BPs liabilities and BP does not admit to a liability of this amount.
Under the terms of the Trust agreement, BP has no right to access the funds once they have been contributed to the trust fund and BP has no decision-making role in connection with the payment by the trust fund of individual and business claims resolved by the GCCF and the new court-supervised claims processes referred to below.
BP will receive funds from the trust fund only upon its expiration, if there are any funds remaining at that point.
Any amount remaining in the trust fund when the trustees determine that all claims have been settled would be returned to BP.
However, it is not possible to reliably estimate the number or total amount of the claims that will be settled from the trust fund, and therefore it is not possible to reliably measure the fair value of BPs residual interest in it.
The carrying amount of BPs residual interest is, consequently, nil.
BP has the authority under the Trust agreement to present certain resolved claims, including natural resource damages claims and state and local response claims, to the Trust for payment, by providing the trustees with all the required documents establishing that such claims are valid under the Trust agreement.
However, any such payments can only be made on the authority of the Trustee and any funds distributed are paid directly to the claimants, not to BP.
BP will not settle any such items directly or receive reimbursement from the trust fund for such items.
The proposed settlement with the PSC announced on 3 March 2012 provides for a transition from the GCCF.
BP has agreed not to wait for final approval of the economic loss settlement before claims are paid.
The economic loss claims process will continue under court supervision before final approval of the settlement, first under the transitional claims process, and then through the settlement claims process established by the proposed economic loss settlement.
The Trust will remain in place, unaffected by the proposed settlement and the transition from the GCCF to the new court-supervised claims processes.
BPs obligation to make contributions to the trust fund was recognized in full in 2010, amounting to $20 billion on an undiscounted basis as it is committed to making these contributions.
On initial recognition the discounted amount recognized was $19,580 million.
After BPs contributions of $15,140 million to the trust fund during 2010 and 2011, and adjustments for discounting, the remaining liability as at 31 December 2011 was $4,872 million.
This liability is recorded within current other payables on the balance sheet, and is expected to be paid in full before the end of 2012.
The table below shows movements in the funding obligation during the period to 31 December 2011.
$ million 2011 2010 At 1 January 14,901 Trust fund liability initially recognized discounted 19,580 Unwinding of discount 52 73 Change in discounting 43 240 Contributions 10,140 5,000 Other 16 8 At 31 December 4,872 14,901 Of which current 4,872 5,002 non-current 9,899 An asset has been recognized representing BPs right to receive reimbursement from the trust fund.
This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP will not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead payments will be made directly to claimants from the trust fund, and BP will be released from its corresponding obligation.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 191 Notes on financial statements 2. significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The portion of the provision recognized during the year for items that will be covered by the trust fund, including the increased estimate of the cost of individual and business claims as a result of the proposed settlement with the PSC announced on 3 March 2012, was $4,038 million 2010 $12,567 million and payments of $3,707 million 2010 $3,023 million were made during the year from the trust fund.
The remaining reimbursement asset as at 31 December 2011 was $9,875 million and is recorded within other receivables on the balance sheet.
The amount of the reimbursement asset is equal to the amount of provisions as at 31 December 2011 that will be covered by the trust fund see Note 36 in the table under Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Movements in the reimbursement asset are presented in the table below.
$ million 2011 2010 At 1 January 9,544 Increase in provision for items covered by the trust fund 4,038 12,567 Amounts paid directly by the trust fund 3,707 3,023 At 31 December 9,875 9,544 Of which current 8,233 5,943 non-current 1,642 3,601 The amount charged or credited in the income statement, before finance costs, related to the trust fund comprises: $ million 2011 2010 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 43 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset 4,038 12,567 Other 8 Total credit charge relating to the trust fund 3,995 7,261 As noted above, the obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund was recognized in full in 2010, on a discounted basis.
In addition, a reimbursement asset of $12,567 million was recognized, reecting the portion of provisions recognized in 2010 that will be covered by the trust fund.
Any new provisions, or increases in provisions, that are covered by the trust fund up to the amount of $20 billion have no net income statement effect as a reimbursement asset is also recognized, as described above.
During 2011, a further $4,038 million was recognized for new or increased provisions for items covered by the trust fund with a corresponding increase in the reimbursement asset, resulting in no net income statement effect.
The cumulative charges for provisions, and the associated reimbursement asset, recognized during 2010 and 2011 amounted to $16,605 million.
Thus, a further $3,395 million could be provided in subsequent periods for items covered by the trust fund with no net impact on the income statement.
Such future increases in amounts provided could arise from adjustments to existing provisions, or from the initial recognition of provisions for items that currently cannot be estimated reliably, namely final judgments and settlements and natural resource damages and related costs.
It is not possible at this time to conclude as to whether the $20-billion fund will be sufficient to satisfy all claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 that will ultimately be paid.
Further information on those items that currently cannot be reliably estimated is provided under Provisions and contingencies and in Note 43.
The Trust agreement does not require BP to make further contributions to the trust fund in excess of the agreed $20 billion should this be insufficient to cover all claims administered by the GCCF and the new court-supervised claims processes, or to settle other items that are covered by the trust fund, as described above.
Should the $20-billion trust fund not be sufficient, BP would commence settling legitimate claims and other costs by making payments directly to claimants.
In this case, increases in estimated future expenditure above $20 billion would be recognized as provisions with a corresponding charge in the income statement.
The provisions would be utilized and derecognized at the point that BP made the payments.
BP pledged certain Gulf of Mexico assets as collateral for the trust fund funding obligation under an agreement entered into in September 2010.
In November 2011, the agreement was amended and restated to change the way the overriding royalty interest is determined.
For further information see Material contracts on page 168.
The pledged collateral consists of an overriding royalty interest in oil and gas production of BPs Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Great White and Mars, Ursa and Na Kika assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
A wholly owned company called Verano Collateral Holdings LLC Verano has been created to hold the overriding royalty interest, which is capped at an amount equal to the product of i the outstanding funding obligation as calculated at the start of each calendar quarter, from and after 1 October 2011, and ii a factor of 1.45 resulting in an amount of $14.7 billion at 1 October 2011, which remained unchanged at 31 December 2011.
Verano has pledged the overriding royalty interest to the Trust as collateral for BPs remaining contribution obligations to the Trust, amounting to $4.9 billion at the end of 2011.
On 2 January 2012 the overriding royalty interest was recalculated as $7.1 billion.
There has been no change in operatorship or the marketing of the production from the assets and there is no effect on the other partners interests in the assets.
For financial reporting purposes Verano is a consolidated entity of BP and there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements from the pledge of the overriding royalty interest.
Provisions and contingencies At 31 December 2011 BP has recorded certain provisions and disclosed certain contingent liabilities as a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
These are described below under Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Other items.
Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 The claims against BP under the OPA 90 and for personal injury fall into three categories: i claims by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity, loss of subsistence use of natural resources and for personal injury Individual and Business Claims : ii claims by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims : and iii claims by the United States, a State trustee, an Indian tribe trustee, or a foreign trustee for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
In addition, BP faces civil litigation in which claims for liability under OPA 90 along with other causes of actions, including personal injury claims, are asserted by individuals, businesses and government entities.
A provision has been recorded for Individual and Business Claims and State and Local Claims.
The proposed settlement with the PSC, subject to final written agreement and court approvals, announced on 3 March 2012 relates to Individual and Business Claims.
A provision has also been recorded for claims administration costs, natural resource damage assessment costs and costs relating to emergency and early natural resource damages restoration agreements.
192 192 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Financial statements Notes on financial statements 2. significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued BP considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any other obligation in relation to Natural Resource Damages claims under OPA 90 or litigation for violations of OPA 90 other than as included within the proposed settlement.
These items are therefore disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The $20-billion trust fund described above is available to satisfy the OPA 90 claims and litigation referred to above, however claims administration costs associated with the existing GCCF organization are borne separately by BP.
The administration costs of processing claims made under the proposed settlement agreement with the PSC are expected to be paid from the trust fund.
However, at this time, the provision for these costs is shown as payable from outside the trust fund as the proposed settlement agreement is subject to final written agreement and court approvals.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the trust fund have been recognized and $20 billion, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was charged to the income statement in 2010.
Other items Provisions at 31 December 2011 also include amounts in relation to completing the oil spill response, BPs commitment to a 10-year research programme in the Gulf of Mexico, estimated penalties for liability under Clean Water Act Section 311 and estimated legal fees.
These are not covered by the trust fund.
The provision does not reect any amounts in relation to fines and penalties except for those relating to the Clean Water Act, as it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amount or timing of such additional items.
BP also considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to litigation other than as included within the proposed settlement with the PSC.
Further information on provisions is provided below and in Note 36.
Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in Note 43.
A provision has been recognized for estimated future expenditure relating to the incident, for items that can be measured reliably at this time, including the increased estimate of the cost of Individual and Business Claims as a result of the proposed settlement with the PSC as described above, in accordance with BPs accounting policy for provisions, as set out in Note 1.
The total amount recognized as a provision during the year was $5,183 million, including $4,038 million for items covered by the trust fund and $1,145 million for other items 2010 $30,261 million, including $12,567 million for items covered by the trust fund and $17,694 million for other items.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $6,208 million, including payments from the trust fund of $3,707 million and payments made directly by BP of $2,501 million 2010 $13,935 million, including payments from the trust fund of $3,023 million and payments made directly by BP of $10,912 million, and after adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2011 was $15,333 million 2010 $16,335 million.
Movements in the provision are presented in the table below.
$ million 2011 2010 At 1 January 16,335 Increase in provision items not covered by the trust fund 1,145 17,694 Increase in provision items covered by the trust fund 4,038 12,567 Unwinding of discount 6 4 Change in discount rate 17 5 Utilization paid by BP 2,501 10,912 Utilization paid by the trust fund 3,707 3,023 At 31 December 15,333 16,335 Of which current 9,437 7,938 Of which non-current 5,896 8,397 The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors including, with respect to certain of the obligations, any determination of BPs culpability based on any findings of negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, the amount and timing of payments under any settlements, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
BP is ready to settle any remaining matters on fair and reasonable terms, but will continue to prepare vigorously for trial.
Any settlements which may be reached relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill could impact the amount and timing of any future payments.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably as noted above.
Impact upon the group income statement The group income statement for 2011 includes a pre-tax credit of $3,742 million 2010 pre-tax charge of $40,935 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The amount charged to date comprises costs incurred up to 31 December 2011, settlements agreed with our co-owners of the Macondo well and other third parties, estimated obligations for future costs that can be estimated reliably at this time and rights and obligations relating to the trust fund.
Finance costs of $58 million 2010 $77 million reect the unwinding of the discount on the trust fund liability and provisions.
The amount of the provision recognized during the year can be reconciled to the income statement amount as follows: $ million 2011 2010 Increase in provision 5,183 30,261 Change in discount rate relating to provisions 17 5 Costs charged directly to the income statement 512 3,339 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 43 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset 4,038 12,567 Settlements credited to the income statement 5,517 profit loss before interest and taxation 3,800 40,858 Costs charged directly to the income statement relate to expenditure prior to the establishment of a provision at the end of the second quarter 2010 and ongoing operating costs of the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO.
The accounting associated with the recognition of the trust fund liability and the expenditure which will be settled from the trust fund is described above.
