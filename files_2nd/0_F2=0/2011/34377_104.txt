The historical cost of properties was 3,816m 2010: 3,401m.
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2010: nil.
Properties valued at 2,850m 2010: 2,659m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to nil 2010: nil.
Included within the property valuation is 76m 2010: 66m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 5m 2010: 5m.
The balance arises through the IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment properties amounts to 73m 2010: 74m.
Included in investment properties are 149m of properties which are in the course of development 2010: 120m.
