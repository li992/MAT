The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork p. l. c. controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.
