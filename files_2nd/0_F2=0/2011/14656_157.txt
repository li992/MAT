Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 20 August 2011 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Significant accounting estimates and judgements continued Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on value in use calculations and estimated sale proceeds.
These calculations require assumptions to be made regarding future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These assumptions are disclosed in note 13.
Actual outcomes may vary from these estimates.
Post-employment benefits The present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions, which are disclosed in note 26.
Any change in these assumptions could impact the carrying amounts of pension liabilities.
Onerous lease provisions The Group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts: however, any changes to the estimated method of exiting from the property could lead to changes to the level of the provision recorded.
