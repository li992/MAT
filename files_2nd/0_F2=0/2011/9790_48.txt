On 23 March 2011, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a number of changes to the UK corporation tax system, including a reduction of the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
This change of rate became substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income T axes on 29 March 2011 when the House of Com mons passed a resolution in respect it under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
The Group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 26%, which has resulted in recognition of a deferred tax credit of 13.1m in the income statement reducing the total effective tax rate by 1.7%, and recognition of a deferred tax credit of 1.3m in other comprehensive income.
The Chancellor also announced his intention to reduce the rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014.
As these changes have not been substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position, they have not been recognised in these financial statements.
Had these changes been enacted, then the cumulative effects would have been credits to the income statement of 19.6m 25%, 26.2m 24%, or 32.7m 23%, and credits to other comprehensive income of 1.9m 25%, 2.5m 24%, or 3.1m 23%.
