A loss of 2m 2010: gain of 14m has been recognised in the income statement in respect of the movement in fair value of these investments.
Property investments which are held via partnerships or unit trust vehicles are also included within equity securities.
A loss of nil 2010: loss of nil has been recognised in the income statement in respect of the movement in fair value of these investments.
Included within unit linked equity securities are 182m 2010: 183m of debt instruments which incorporate an embedded derivative linked to the value of the Groups share price.
CDOs The Group holds collateralised debt obligations CDO with a market value of 998m at 31 December 2011 2010: 1,022m.
These holdings include 846m 2010: 875m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by Legal & General as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The Group selected at outset and manages the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversied portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The Group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk, although no substitutions were made in 2010 and substitutions in 2011 were limited.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: At 31.12.11 At 31.12.10 Sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services & Goods 25 26 Financial Services 6 6 Technology & Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil & Gas 6 6 Health Care 4 3 100 100 128 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CONTINUED i Financial investments at fair value continued The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 27.5%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, then over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 28% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 31% or if 44% of the names in the diversied global investment grade portfolio defaulted, with an average 30% recovery rate.
All gures are averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2010 or 2011.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the Group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependant on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs for the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
During the year the Group received nil 2010: 155m of previously posted collateral.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation which is based on observable market inputs.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
For the purposes of valuing the non profit annuity regulatory and IFRS liabilities, the yield on the CDOs is included within the calculation of the yield used to calculate the valuation discount rate for the annuity liabilities.
An allowance for the risks, including default, is also made.
For EEV purposes, the yield on the CDOs, reduced by the realistic default assumption, is similarly included in assumed future investment returns.
The balance of 152m 2010: 147m of CDO holdings includes a 26m 2010: 37m exposure to an equity tranche of a bespoke CDO.

Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reect the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are dened as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classied them as level 2.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classied in level 2.
Level 3 assets, where internal models are used to represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed, and reect unquoted equities including investments in private equity, property vehicles and suspended securities.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classied with level 3.
The Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The Group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash ows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 131 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the Groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgements regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ signicantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could signicantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee.

There have been no significant transfers to or from level 3 during both 2010 and 2011.
As discussed above, the fair values of financial instruments are, in certain circumstances, measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument and are not based on observable market data.
The following table shows the level 3 financial instruments carried at fair value as at the balance sheet date, the valuation basis, main assumptions used in the valuation of these instruments and reasonably possible increases or decreases in fair value based on reasonably possible alternative assumptions.
