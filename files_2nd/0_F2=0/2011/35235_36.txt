106 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, property, plant and equipment, available for sale investments, and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The accounting policies used are consistent with those applied in the 2010 annual financial statements, as amended to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective in the year and the presentational changes outlined below.
2 Changes in accounting policies The principal accounting policies are described in note 41 and are consistent with those applied in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The new standards adopted during 2011 and the changes in accounting policies in 2011 are outlined below.
New standards adopted during the year The following standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the EU are effective for the first time for the Groups 31 December 2011 year end: IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures revised : IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment : IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction: IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: and Amendments arising from the 2010 annual improvements project.
These had no material impact on the financial statements.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations applicable to the Groups financial statements which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective at the year end.
The following standards are deemed not relevant to the Group or to have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group when the relevant standards come into effect: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures amendment : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amendment : IAS 12 Income Taxes amendment : IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment : IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
The following standards will affect the accounting for any future joint arrangements entered into by the Group: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
Accounting policy changes As a result of the issue of 175m convertible bonds in June 2011, the following accounting policy has been adopted by the Group: Convertible bonds The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option.
This is recognised and included in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently re-measured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The issue costs apportioned to the liability are amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity are not amortised.
107 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 2 Changes in accounting policies continued In addition, with effect from 1 January 2011, the Group has made the following changes to its accounting policies: Capitalisation of interest In accordance with IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, interest has been capitalised on development projects.
The Group capitalises interest on development expenditure at the average cost of borrowings during the period.
In the year to 31 December 2011 the Group capitalised 2.2m of interest.
Had the Group adopted this policy from 1 January 2010, interest of 0.2m would have been capitalised during the year to 31 December 2010.
Due to the immaterial amounts involved in 2010 and prior years, the comparative figures have not been restated for this accounting policy change.
Owner-occupied property The Group occupies a portion of one of its properties.
Due to an increased level of occupation and an uplift in the valuation, the Directors now consider the owner-occupied portion to be significant.
It has, therefore, been transferred to property, plant and equipment from investment property in accordance with IAS 40, Investment Property, and IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
This part of the building is now being depreciated, in a similar way to other tangible fixed assets, over its remaining useful life with the depreciation included in administrative expenses.
The respective revaluation movement and associated deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement and included within a revaluation reserve in equity rather than in retained earnings.
As a result of this second accounting policy change, the following adjustments have been made to the comparative income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and the balance sheets: Restated position As previously reported Impact 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 m m m m m m Income statement 1 Administrative expenses 20.9 17.6 20.8 17.5 0.1 0.1 Revaluation surplus deficit 298.1 79.6 301.6 81.1 3.5 1.5 Tax credit charge 8.7 1.0 9.4 1.0 0.7 Profit loss for the year 352.8 24.8 355.4 25.5 2.6 0.7 2 Other comprehensive income expense in the year 2.4 4.5 0.2 3.8 2.6 0.7 Overall impact on total comprehensive income Basic earnings loss per share p 339.68 25.89 342.25 26.59 2.57 0.70 Diluted earnings loss per share p 337.47 25.89 340.03 26.59 2.56 0.70 Property, Investment plant and Other Retained 3 property equipment reserves earnings m m m m Balance sheet 1 January 2009 As previously reported 2,085.6 1.2 923.4 95.0 Restated position 2,072.3 14.5 927.6 90.8 Impact 13.3 13.3 4.2 4.2 31 December 2009 As previously reported 1,888.6 1.4 916.8 48.5 Restated position 1,876.9 13.1 920.1 45.2 Impact 11.7 11.7 3.3 3.3 31 December 2010 As previously reported 2,388.5 1.5 918.1 367.5 Restated position 2,373.3 16.7 924.0 361.6 Impact 15.2 15.2 5.9 5.9 1 Restatement due to the depreciation charge on the owner-occupied portion of the investment property.
2 Represents the revaluation surplus, net of deferred tax, for the owner-occupied portion of the investment property, previously reported in the income statement.
3 The difference represents the transfer from retained earnings to the accumulated revaluation reserve, net of deferred tax, of the owner-occupied portion of the investment property.
108 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 3 Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in note 41.
Not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended to provide an understanding of the policies that management consider critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Trade receivables The Group is required to judge when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade receivables.
It does this on the basis of the age of the relevant receivables, external evidence of the credit status of the debtor entity and the nature of any disputed amounts.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items which are sufficiently material by either their size or nature as to require separate disclosure.
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement.
Property portfolio valuation The Group uses the valuation carried out by its independent valuers as the fair value of its property portfolio.
The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and the appropriate discount rate.
The valuers also make reference to market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Outstanding rent reviews Where the outcome of an outstanding rent review is reasonably certain, rent is accrued from the rent review date based upon an estimated annual rent.
This estimate is derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties and is only accrued where the outcome is considered to be reasonably certain.
Compliance with the real estate investment trust REIT taxation regime The Group is a REIT and is thereby exempt from tax on both rental profits and chargeable gains.
In order to retain REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be maintained.
The main criteria are as follows: at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Groups assets: at least 75% of the Groups total profits must arise from the tax exempt business: and at least 90% of the tax exempt business must be distributed.
The Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the property rental business which is within the REIT structure.
4 Segmental information IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which in the Groups case is its executive Board comprising the six executive Directors in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal financial reports received by the Groups executive Board contain financial information at a Group level as a whole and there are no reconciling items between the results contained in these reports and the amounts reported in the financial statements.
These internal financial reports include the IFRS figures but also report the non-IFRS figures for the adjusted earnings per share, net asset value and profit figures.
Reconciliations of each of these figures to their statutory equivalents are detailed in note 16.
Additionally, information is provided to the executive Board showing gross property income and investment property valuation by individual property.
Therefore, for the purposes of IFRS 8, each individual property is considered to be a separate operating segment in that its performance is monitored individually.
The Groups property portfolio includes investment property, owner-occupied property and assets held for sale and comprises 92% office buildings by value.
The Directors consider that these properties have similar economic characteristics.
Therefore, these individual properties have been aggregated into a single operating segment.
The remaining 8% represents a mixture of retail, hotel, residential and light industrial properties, as well as land, each of which is fide minimis in its own right.
Accordingly, the Directors are of the view that it is appropriate to disclose two reportable segments, office buildings and other, by reference to gross property income and property value.
No tenant accounts for more than 10% of gross property income in either 2011 or 2010, and no individual property accounts for more than 10% of the value of the property portfolio in either year.
1 Some office buildings have an ancillary element such as retail or residential.

All of the Groups properties are based in the UK.
The Group also has a joint venture in Prague which represents 0.2% of the Groups assets see note 19 and is excluded from this analysis.
No geographical grouping is contained in any of the internal financial reports provided to the Groups executive Board.
Therefore, no geographical segmental analysis is required by IFRS 8.
However, the following analysis is included to provide users with additional information regarding the geographical areas contained in the business review.

The Group has included the income from this building within gross property income as, although similar to a lease surrender arrangement, the Groups entitlement to this rental income is linked to its continued ownership of the property rather than being an unconditional amount receivable whether as an upfront payment or through a series of instalments.
Additionally, rental income includes 8.8m 2010: 5.4m relating to rents recognised in advance of the cash receipts.
Other income relates to fees and commissions earned in relation to the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of services.
It also includes 0.2m 2010: nil of development income which represents the finalisation of the profit share earned by the Group from the project management of the construction and letting of a property on behalf of a third party.

Total interest paid during 2011 was 38.5m 2010: 38.8m of which 2.0m 2010: nil was included in capital expenditure on investment properties in the Group cash flow statement under investing activities.
The foreign exchange loss in 2010 of 0.2m resulted from the translation of an intercompany loan from a non-trading US subsidiary.
The impact on net asset value from this exchange movement was minimal as there is an offsetting entry in equity see Group statement of comprehensive income.
During 2011, there was no exchange loss or gain on the intercompany loan.
Other finance income in 2010 included 0.8m received as a contribution towards the costs of arranging alternative financing upon the early repayment of a banking facility.
In accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, this amount was credited to the income statement.
No such contribution was received in 2011.

The weighted average exercise price of share options at 31 December 2011 was 12.62 2010: 9.54.
The weighted average remaining contracted life of share options at 31 December 2011 was 8.37 years 2010: 8.70 years.
The weighted average exercise price of options that lapsed during 2011 was 11.40 2010: 8.47.
No share options were forfeited during 2011 or 2010.
112 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 13 Share-based payments continued The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of the options granted during 2010 and 2011 under the equity-settled employee share plan operated by the Group.
Risk-free interest Dividend rate Volatility yield Date of grant % % % 18 March 2010 3.4 40.0 2.0 25 March 2011 2.4 40.0 1.8 For both the 2011 and 2010 grants, additional assumptions have been made that there is no employee turnover and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 20% in the money and 50% of employees exercise early when the share options are 100% in the money.
The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns, is based on a statistical analysis of daily prices over the last three years.
Group cash-settled option scheme All options relating to the cash-settled option scheme arose as a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc.
A binomial lattice pricing model was used to value the cash-settled options.
The closing share price at 31 December 2011 of 15.60 2010: 15.61 and a dividend yield of 1.9% 2010: 1.8% were used together with a risk-free interest rate of 0.3% 2010: between 0.5% and 1.3% depending on the term of the options.
Due to the small number of individuals who have been granted these options, an assumption of zero employee turnover has been made.
Additionally, volatilities of 28% pa and 25% pa have been used for options with expected terms of one and two years respectively 2010: 21% pa, 44% pa and 46% pa.
In general, the value of an option is affected by how quickly employees are assumed to exercise their awards after vesting.
In this case, however, given the other assumptions, the share price at 31 December 2011, and the fact that the expected lives of the options are relatively short, the fair values are not sensitive to this assumption.
It has been assumed that employees try to maximise their returns and therefore do not exercise their options immediately, but tend to exercise their options later at the financially optimal date.
14 Pension costs The Group and Company operate a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter was acquired as part of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007 and is closed to new members.
All new employees are entitled to join the defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
Defined contribution plan The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was 0.9m 2010: 0.9m.
Defined benefit plan The defined benefit scheme, which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Managed Fund Policy with F&C Fund Management Limited, Legal & General Investment Management Limited and Ruffer LLP plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that the return on the fund will be 6.9% pa 2010: 7.7% pa and that salaries will be increased at 4.6% pa 2010: 5.0% pa.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31 December 2011 was 13.2m 2010: 12.0m and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 90% 2010: 110% of the benefit of 14.7m 2010: 10.9m that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.

The overall expected return on plan assets is derived as the weighted average of the long-term expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The long-term expected rate of return on cash is determined by reference to gilt rates at the balance sheet dates.
The long-term expected return on bonds is determined by reference to corporate bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The long-term expected rates of return on equities and property are based on the rate of return on bonds with allowance for outperformance.

16 Profit before tax, earnings and net asset value per share On 2 June 2011, the Group issued 175m of unsecured convertible bonds.
The initial conversion price of the bonds was set at 22.22 and the share price at 31 December 2011 was 15.60.
Although it is not expected that the bonds would be converted at this share price, the dilutive effect of these shares is required to be recognised in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings Per Share.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, these shares are dilutive for basic earnings per share.
However, they are anti-dilutive for both EPRA and underlying earnings per share and all net asset per share measures, and have therefore been excluded from those calculations.

As part of this transaction, the Group was granted a 150-year headlease and sold 50% of its ownership to the Grosvenor Estate for 60m, before costs.
In addition, the Group has exchanged contracts to sell two properties with completion conditional on a suitable planning permission the receipt of which is expected to occur during the second half of 2012.
Therefore, at 31 December 2011, these properties have been recognised as non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale see note 17 for historic cost.
The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the Companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that are exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.
The onerous contract relates to the excess of rent payable over rent receivable on a lease at the Groups previous head office which expires in August 2014 and reflects the discounted present value of future net payments under that lease.
A provision is made for the potential liability for cash-settled share options based on the valuation carried out at each balance sheet date see note 13.
In addition, the 2026 bonds are secured by a floating charge over a number of the Groups subsidiary companies which contain 477.0m 2010: 436.6m of the Groups properties.
At 31 December 2011, 945.3m 2010: 750.8m of the Groups properties were subject to a fixed charge to secure the Companys bank loans.

At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Companys fixed rate debt comprised the instruments used to hedge its floating rate debt.
Secured Bonds 2026 As a result of the acquisition of London Merchant Securities plc in 2007, the secured bonds 2026 were included at fair value less issue costs.
This difference between fair value and principal value is being amortised through the income statement.
The fair value shown in note 28 was determined by the ask-price of 122 per 100 as at 31 December 2011 2010: 109 per 100.
Unsecured Bonds 2016 In June 2011 the Group issued a convertible bond.
The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.75% until July 2016.
In accordance with IFRS the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
As a result, 165.4m was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6m, which represents the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value is amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 4.8m have been allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component is amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2m are not amortised.
The fair value shown in note 28 was determined by the ask-price of 99 per 100 as at 31 December 2011.
The carrying value at 31 December 2011 was 162.4m.
Reconciliation of nominal value to carrying value: m Nominal value 175.0 Fair value adjustment on issue allocated to equity 9.6 Debt component on issue 165.4 Unamortised issue costs 4.0 Amortisation of fair value adjustment 1.0 Carrying amount included in total debt at 31 December 2011 162.4 Hedged debt The hedged debt consists of interest rate swaps and, in 2010, an interest rate cap.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates and the fixed rates payable if the swaps were to be replaced on 31 December 2011 for the period to the contracted expiry dates.
The fair value of the interest rate cap represented the net cost of replacement on identical terms at prices prevailing on 31 December 2010.

There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2011 or 2010.
Financial instruments risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: credit risk: fair value or cash flow interest rate risk: and liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
The following describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Further information on risk as required by IFRS 7 is given on pages 25 to 27 and page 81.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods.
The Company has the same risk profile as the Group except tenant credit risk, which does not exist in the Company and therefore no separate analysis has been provided in relation to the Company.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are trade receivables, cash at bank, bank overdraft, trade and other payables, floating rate bank loans, secured and unsecured bonds, interest rate swaps and, in 2010, an interest rate cap.
General objectives, policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to executive management.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups flexibility and its ability to maximise returns.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from its lease contracts.
It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new tenants before entering into contracts.
The Board has established a credit committee which assesses each new tenant before a new lease is signed.
The review includes the latest sets of financial statements, external ratings, when available, and, in some cases, forecast information and bank and trade references.
The covenant strength of each tenant is determined based on this review and, if appropriate, a deposit or a guarantee is obtained.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the wide range of tenants from a broad spectrum of business sectors.
129 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued Credit risk continued Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating of investment grade are accepted.
This risk is also reduced by the short periods that money is on deposit at any one time.
The quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to trade and other receivables which are neither past due nor impaired are disclosed in note 23.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from borrowings at variable rates.
It is currently Group policy that between 60% and 85% of external Group borrowings excluding finance lease payables are at fixed rates.
Where the Group wishes to vary the amount of external fixed rate debt it holds subject to it being at least 60% and no more than 85% of expected Group borrowings, as noted above, the Group makes use of interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired interest rate profile.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2011, the proportion of fixed debt held by the Group was above this range at 98%.
In January 2012, two interest rate swaps were broken and replaced with a lower value of swap.
This had the effect of reducing this figure to 90%.
During both 2011 and 2010, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.
The Group monitors the interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates and this would result in an increase of 0.1m 2010: 1.3m or a decrease of 0.1m 2010: 1.3m.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps quantitative disclosures are given in note 27.
The Group generally raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient headroom in its loan facilities to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.
To achieve this aim, it seeks to maintain committed facilities to meet the expected requirements.
The Group also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates and hence cash flows on a portion of its long-term borrowings.
This is further explained in the fair value and cash flow interest rate risk section above.
The executive management receives rolling three-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis and three-year projections of loan balances on a regular basis as part of the Groups forecasting processes.
At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The Groups loan facilities are spread across a range of banks so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk.
The liquidity risk of the Group is managed centrally by the finance department.
130 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued Capital disclosures The Groups capital comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, other reserves, retained earnings and minority interest.
The Groups objectives when maintaining capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders: and to provide an above average annualised total return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of balance sheet gearing and the loan to value ratio.
During 2011, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2010, was to maintain the balance sheet gearing below 80% in normal circumstances.
The three gearing ratios are defined on page 143 and are derived below.
Balance sheet gearing 2011 2010 m m Net debt 864.5 887.8 Net assets 1,714.5 1,494.7 Balance sheet gearing 50.4% 59.4% Loan to value ratio 2011 2010 m m Net debt 864.5 887.8 Unamortised issue costs and fair value adjustment of secured bonds 18.6 19.4 Unamortised arrangement costs 7.9 5.9 Leasehold liabilities 7.4 7.4 Drawn facilities 846.4 866.9 Fair value of property portfolio 2,646.5 2,426.1 Loan to value ratio 32.0% 35.7% Interest cover ratio 2011 2010 m m Gross property income 125.5 119.4 Surrender premiums 2.4 0.7 Ground rent 0.8 0.8 Gross rental income net of ground rent 122.3 117.9 Net finance costs 43.2 37.9 Foreign exchange loss 0.2 Net pension return 0.2 0.3 Finance lease costs 0.5 0.5 Amortisation of fair value adjustment to secured bonds 0.8 0.8 Amortisation of issue and arrangement costs 2.0 1.0 Non-utilisation fees 1.9 1.4 Net interest payable 39.8 35.9 Interest cover ratio 307% 328% 131 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 29 Deferred tax Revaluation surplus Other Total m m m Group Deferred tax liability At 1 January 2011 8.9 3.0 5.9 Released during the year in other comprehensive income 0.7 0.7 Provided released during the year in the income statement 1.2 0.8 0.4 Change in tax rates 0.6 0.2 0.4 At 31 December 2011 8.8 3.6 5.2 At 1 January 2010 8.1 2.2 5.9 Provided during the year in other comprehensive income 1.0 1.0 Provided released during the year in the income statement 0.1 0.9 0.8 Change in tax rates 0.3 0.1 0.2 At 31 December 2010 8.9 3.0 5.9 Company Deferred tax asset At 1 January 2011 2.6 2.6 Provided during the year in the income statement 0.8 0.8 Change in tax rates 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2011 3.3 3.3 At 1 January 2010 1.6 1.6 Provided during the year in the income statement 1.1 1.1 Change in tax rates 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2010 2.6 2.6 Deferred tax on the revaluation surplus is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment property portfolio as at each balance sheet date.
The calculation takes account of indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
Due to the Groups REIT status, deferred tax is only provided at each balance sheet date on properties outside of the REIT regime.
30 Equity The authorised share capital was 6.04m at 1 January 2010, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011.
The number of 5p ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 101,640,982 2010: 100,200,297.
In 2011, 296,225 2010: nil shares were issued as a result of scrip dividends awarded during the year, 144,460 2010: 39,034 shares were issued as a result of awards vesting under the Groups Performance Share Plan, and, in 2010, 211,000 shares were issued as a result of the exercise of share options which realised proceeds of 1.3m.
The number of outstanding share options and other share awards granted are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 86 to 95 and note 13.

These contracts relate wholly to the construction, development or enhancement of the Groups investment properties.
At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, there were no obligations for the purchase, repair or maintenance of investment properties.
37 Contingent liabilities The Company and its subsidiaries are party to cross guarantees securing the overdraft and certain bank loans.
At 31 December 2011 the maximum liability that could arise for the Company from the cross guarantees amounted to nil 2010: 5.4m.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
38 Post balance sheet events In February 2012, the Group signed a joint venture agreement with Grosvenor, for the future development of 1-5 Grosvenor Place, SW1.
As part of the transaction the headleases, that were due to expire in 2063 and 2084, were regeared into a new 150-year term at a ground rent of 5% of rental income.
Simultaneously, the Group has sold 50% of its ownership to Grosvenor and received 60m, before costs.

These vary dependent on the individual tenant and the respective property and demise but typically are let for a term of five to 15 years, at a market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments and recovery of other direct costs.
The weighted average lease length of the leases granted during 2011 was 10.0 years 2010: 8.4 years.
Of these leases, 59% 2010: 47% included a rent-free or half rent period or at the start of the lease.
134 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 40 Related party disclosure Details of Directors remuneration are given in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 86 to 95 and note 11.
Other related party transactions are as follows: Group Up until 1 October 2011, John Burns and Simon Silver were partners in The Pilcher Hershman Partnership LLP, estate agents, when they resigned.
After their resignation they held no further interest in the partnership.
The partnership received fees at a commercial rate in respect of the letting, acquisition and disposal of certain properties owned by the Group of 0.5m in the nine months to 30 September 2011 year to 31 December 2010: 0.5m.
Procedures had been established whereby the Audit Committee were able to verify that neither John Burns nor Simon Silver derived any direct benefit from these fees.
In 2011, following a move to smaller premises, LMS Capital plc, an investment company of which Robert Rayne is a director, occupied offices owned by the Group for which they paid a commercial rent of 0.2m 2010: 0.4m.
The Group also contributed 0.1m 2010: 0.1m to LMS Capital plcs running costs in the year.
During the year, the Group paid fees at a commercial rate in respect of the acquisition of certain properties of nil 2010: 0.2m to Everton Philips LLP, a firm in which the son of Mr J. D. Burns was a partner, and 0.1m 2010: nil in respect of the disposal of certain properties to Hamilton Investment Properties Ltd, a company of which Mr S. P. Silvers son was a director.
There are no outstanding balances owed to the Group with respect to all of the above transactions.
At 31 December 2011, included within other receivables in note 23 is an amount owed by the Portman Estate, the minority owner of one of the Groups subsidiaries, of 10.2m 2010: 9.7m.
The majority of this amount represents advances to the Portman Estate, relating to proceeds received upon the disposal of jointly owned properties.
This debt will be discharged by a distribution to shareholders.

The Group has not made any provision for bad or doubtful debts in respect of related party debtors.
Intercompany balances are repayable on demand except the long-term loan from Derwent London Capital Jersey Limited, the payment and repayment terms of which mirror those of the convertible bonds.
From 1 January 2010, interest was charged on the on-demand intercompany balances at an arms length basis.
135 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 41 Significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Derwent London plc and all of its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its joint ventures.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences and until the date control ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting as permitted by IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures, and following the procedures for this method set out in IAS 28, Investments in Associates.
The equity method requires the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the period to be presented separately in the income statement and the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Gross property income Gross property income arises from two main sources: i Rental income This arises from operating leases granted to tenants.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
A finance lease is one whereby substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the lessee.
Rental income is recognised in the Group income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in accordance with SIC 15, Operating Leases Incentives.
This includes the effect of lease incentives given to tenants, which are normally in the form of rent-free or half rent periods or capital contributions in lieu of rent-free periods and the effect of payments received from tenants on the grant of leases.
For income from property leased out under a finance lease, a lease receivable asset is recognised in the balance sheet at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, as defined in IAS 17, Leases.
Minimum lease payments receivable, again defined in IAS 17, are apportioned between finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Contingent rents, being the difference between the rent currently receivable and the minimum lease payments when the net investment in the lease was originally calculated, are recognised in property income in the years in which they are receivable.
ii Surrender premiums Payments received from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Other income Other income consists of commissions and fees arising from the management of the Groups properties and is recognised in the Group income statement in accordance with the delivery of service.
Borrowing costs In accordance with IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, the Group capitalises interest on development expenditure at the average cost of borrowings during the period.
Expenses i Lease payments Where investment properties are held under operating leases, the leasehold interest is classified as if it were held under a finance lease, which is recognised at its fair value on the balance sheet, within the investment property carrying value.
Upon initial recognition, a corresponding liability is included as a finance lease liability.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining finance lease liability.
Contingent rents payable, being the difference between the rent currently payable and the minimum lease payments when the lease liability was originally calculated, are charged as expenses within property expenditure in the years in which they are payable.
ii Dilapidations Dilapidations monies received from tenants in respect of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Group income statement, unless they relate to future capital expenditure.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iii Reverse surrender premiums Payments made to tenants to surrender their lease obligations are charged directly to the Group income statement unless the payment is to enable the probable redevelopment of a property.
In the latter case, where the costs are considered to be recoverable, they are capitalised as part of the carrying value of the property.
iv Other property expenditure Vacant property costs and other property costs are expensed in the year to which they relate.
136 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 41 Significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits i Share-based remuneration a Equity-settled The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and share option scheme.
The fair value of the conditional awards of shares granted under the long-term incentive plan and the options granted under the share option scheme are determined at the date of grant.
This fair value is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the non-market based performance criteria of the long-term incentive plan are reconsidered and the expense is revised as necessary.
In respect of the share option scheme, the fair value of options granted is calculated using a binomial lattice pricing model.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, no expense is recognised for options or conditional shares granted on or before 7 November 2002. b Cash-settled For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised based on the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
The movement in the current fair value is taken to the Group income statement.
ii Pensions a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Group income statement in the period to which they relate.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gain or loss in the period is recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Any excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and resulting deferred tax thereon is recognised as goodwill.
Any discount is credited to the Group income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Group income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any residual goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment property i Valuation Investment properties are those that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, including those that are undergoing redevelopment.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, they are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value adjusted for the carrying value of leasehold interests and lease incentive debtors.
Fair value is the amount for which an investment property could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The valuation is undertaken by independent valuers who hold recognised and relevant professional qualifications and have recent experience in the locations and categories of properties being valued.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are reported in the Group income statement in the year in which they arise.
ii Capital expenditure Capital expenditure, being costs directly attributable to the redevelopment or refurbishment of an investment property, up to the point of it being completed for its intended use, are capitalised in the carrying value of that property.
In addition, in accordance with IAS 23, Borrowing Costs, interest that is directly attributable to such expenditure is capitalised using the Groups average cost of borrowings during each quarter.
iii Disposal The disposal of investment properties is accounted for on completion of contract.
On disposal, any gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value at the last year end plus subsequent capitalised expenditure during the year.
Where the net disposal proceeds have yet to be finalised at the balance sheet date, the proceeds recognised reflect the Directors best estimate of the amounts expected to be received.
iv Development When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued use as an investment property or acquires a property with the subsequent intention of developing as an investment property, the property is classified as an investment property and is accounted for as such.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sale, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is remeasured to fair value as at the date of transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement.
The remeasured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
137 Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 41 Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment i Owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property is stated at its revalued amount, which is determined in the same manner as investment property.
It is depreciated over its remaining useful life 40 years with the depreciation included in administrative expenses.
On revaluation, any accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the property concerned, and the net amount restated to the revalued amount.
Subsequent depreciation charges are adjusted based on the revalued amount for each property.
Any difference between the depreciation charge on the revalued amount and that which would have been charged under historic cost is transferred, net of any related deferred tax, between the revaluation reserve and retained earnings as the property is utilised.
Surpluses or deficits resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The land element of the property is not depreciated.
ii Artwork Artwork is stated at revalued amounts on the basis of open market value.
iii Other Plant and equipment is depreciated at a rate of between 10% and 25% per annum which is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of the individual assets, over their expected useful lives.
Investments Investments in joint ventures, being those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, as established by contractual agreement, are included in the Groups balance sheet at cost together with the Groups share of post-acquisition reserves, on a net equity basis.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are included in the Companys balance sheet at the lower of cost and their net asset value.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met if the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, being actively marketed and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets, including related liabilities, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs of disposal.
Financial assets i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and on-demand deposits less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
ii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Financial liabilities i Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are included as financial liabilities on the balance sheets at the amounts drawn on the particular facilities.
Interest payable is expensed as a finance cost in the year to which it relates.
ii Bonds These are included as a financial liability on the balance sheet net of the unamortised discount and costs on issue.
The difference between this carrying value and the redemption value is recognised in the Group income statement over the life of the bond on an effective interest basis.
Interest payable to bond holders is expensed in the year to which it relates.
iii Finance lease liabilities Finance lease liabilities arise for those investment properties held under a leasehold interest and accounted for as investment property.
The liability is initially calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments, reducing in subsequent years by the apportionment of payments to the lessor, as described above under the heading for lease payments.
iv Interest rate derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the financing of the Groups business.
No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
At each reporting date, these interest rate derivatives are measured at fair value, being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit rating of the counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement is recognised in the Group income statement.
v Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value.
