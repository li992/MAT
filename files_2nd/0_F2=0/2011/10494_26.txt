Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Group has also complied with South African Statements and Interpretations of Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the business review, under the heading Going concern.
Comparative information has been restated where appropriate to re ect the discontinued operation of Mpact formerly Mondi Packaging South Africa as described in note 9.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation Dual listed structure The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
Subsidiaries The combined and consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash ows of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, and of their respective subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern operating and financial policy in order to obtain economic bene ts.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into alignment with those used by the Group.
The interest of non-controlling interests is measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition, except for those instances where the Group elects to measure the non-controlling interests at fair value in accordance with the allowance provided in IFRS 3, Business Combinations revised.
After initial recognition non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent proportionate share of pro ts and losses.
Associates Associates are investments over which the Group is in a position to exercise signi cant in uence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Typically, the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its associates.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except when classi ed as held for sale.
The Groups share of associates net income, presented net of tax, is based on financial statements drawn up to reporting dates that are either coterminous with that of the Group or no more than three months prior to that date.
Where reporting dates are not coterminous, adjustments are made to the associates net income for the effects of signi cant transactions or events that occur after the associates reporting date up to the reporting date of the Group.

indd 91 2 2012 03 02 9:43 AM 012 03 02 9:43 AM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Accounting policies continued The total carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long-term debt interests which in substance form part of the Groups net investment in that entity.
The carrying values of associates are reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment has occurred, it is written off in the year in which those circumstances arose.
The Groups share of an associates losses in excess of its interest in that associate is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest with a contractually agreed sharing of control over the strategic, financial and operating decisions with one or more other venturers.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the joint ventures individual income, expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash ows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements.
The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the Group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of pro ts or losses from the joint venture that result from the Groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party.
However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.
Revenue recognition Sale of goods Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
This is when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Sale of green energy and CO credits 2 Revenues generated from the sale of green energy and CO credits issued under international schemes are recorded as income 2 within other net operating expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer.
Investment income Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, and loans and receivables, is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment has been established.
Business combinations Identi able net assets At the date of acquisition the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate are recorded at their fair values on acquisition date.
Assets and liabilities, which cannot be measured reliably, are recorded at provisional fair values which are nalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Cost of a business combination The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree.
The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

indd 92 2 2012 03 02 9:43 AM 012 03 02 9:43 AM 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identi able net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included within intangible assets.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of associates.
Where the fair values of the identi able net assets acquired exceed the cost of the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the acquisition bargain purchase, is credited to the combined and consolidated income statement in the year of acquisition.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Boards for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Non-current nonfinancial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and retirement bene ts surplus Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings, property, plant and equipment and assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing the assets to the location and condition for their intended use and includes borrowing costs incurred to the extent that the asset is a qualifying asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, and assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives range from three years to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of cash cost and the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
These assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful lives of the assets.
Licences, other intangibles and research and development expenditure Licences and other intangibles are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives vary between three years and 10 years and are reviewed at least annually.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Development costs are reviewed annually and are recognised as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.
Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset is both commercially and technically feasible and is amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development.

indd 93 2 2012 03 02 9:43 AM 012 03 02 9:43 AM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash ows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit, is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised as an expense in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Such reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset, or cash-generating unit, in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Agriculture Owned forestry assets Owned forestry assets are measured at fair value, calculated by applying the expected selling price, less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date.
The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity pro le of the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location and other environmental considerations and excludes future growth.
The product of these is then adjusted to present value by applying a market related pre tax discount rate.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses.
At point of felling, the carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory.
Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented within cash ows from investing activities in the combined and consolidated statement of cash ows.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets, and disposal groups, are classi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets, and disposal groups, classi ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell from the date on which these conditions are met.
Any resulting impairment is reported through the combined and consolidated income statement as a special item.
On classi cation as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
Discontinued operations are either a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that have been disposed of or are part of a single co-ordinated plan for disposal, or represent a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Once an operation has been identi ed as discontinued, its net pro t or loss is presented separately in the combined and consolidated income statement and related notes.
Comparative information is also restated.
Information presented in the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and cash ows, including related notes to these statements, is not separated between continuing and discontinued operations.
Current nonfinancial assets Inventory Inventory and work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the first-infirst-out FIFO or weighted average cost basis, as appropriate.
Cost comprises direct materials and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is fide ned as the selling price less any estimated costs to sell.

fide ned contribution plans For fide ned contribution schemes, the amount charged to the combined and consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
fide ned bene t and post-retirement medical plans For fide ned bene t pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end.
The average discount rate for the plans liabilities is based on AA rated corporate bonds or similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
Pension plans assets are measured using year end market values.
Actuarial gains and losses, which arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating pro t. The expected return on plan assets and the expected increase during the year in the present value of plan liabilities are included in investment income and interest expense respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the bene ts are already vested or is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period until the bene ts become vested.
The retirement bene ts obligation recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset retirement bene ts surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the relevant Group scheme.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge, the movement in deferred tax and the South African Secondary Tax on Companies STC, which is an income tax charge on dividends declared.
Current tax The current tax payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The Group pays STC on dividends declared by South African entities net of dividends received, based on the applicable STC rate.
The STC regime is being replaced with a new Dividend Tax DT regime, effective 1 April 2012, which will constitute a withholding tax imposed at a shareholder level but payable by the Group on behalf of the shareholder.
DT will be imposed in respect of any dividend approved by a company on or after 1 April 2012, and will be levied at a rate of 15%.
This rate may be reduced under the provisions of certain Double Tax Agreements.
In addition, the DT legislation includes a number of exemptions, including an exemption for dividends paid to certain exempt entities.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax pro t nor accounting pro t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
The carrying amount is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro t will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Similarly, it is increased to the extent that it is probable that suf cient taxable pro t will be available in the future for all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the combined and consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Leases Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
Operating leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the combined and consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of use.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element of the rental is recognised as a finance charge in the combined and consolidated income statement, unless it is directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case it is capitalised in accordance with the Groups policy on borrowing costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it will be required to settle.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restoration and environmental costs An obligation to incur restoration and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the ongoing production of a plant or land ll site.
Costs for restoration of site damage are provided for at their present values and charged against pro t and loss as the obligation arises.

They are released to the combined and consolidated income statement on a systematic basis, either over the expected useful lives of the assets for which they are provided, or over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded in their functional currencies at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the combined and consolidated income statement for the year and are classi ed as either operating or nancing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
Translation of overseas operations The Groups results are presented in euro, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year where these approximate the rates on the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are reclassi ed to pro t and loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the overseas operation.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions where applicable.
Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined and consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups combined and consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial asset investments Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are either classi ed as available-for-sale or loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at fair value.
They are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to fair value.
Any unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity until an investment is disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined and consolidated statement of cash ows and in the presentation of net debt are re ected net of overdrafts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowance for any impairment as appropriate.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Net debt Net debt is a non-IFRS measure and consists of short-term, medium and long-term borrowings and bank overdrafts less cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments.
Borrowing costs Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed speci cally to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the construction period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risk.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently held at fair value in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments, and are classi ed as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classi ed within operating pro t or net finance costs, depending on the type of risk that the derivative relates to.

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Groups cash ow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, amounts deferred in the Groups cash ow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects pro t and loss on a proportionate basis.
Fair value hedges For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the associated derivative are also recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Ineffective, expired, sold, terminated or exercised hedging instruments Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Equity instruments, share issue costs, treasury shares and dividend payments Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction, net of applicable tax, from the proceeds.
An incremental share issue cost is one which would not have arisen if shares had not been issued.
Treasury shares The purchase by any Group entity of either Mondi Limiteds or Mondi plcs equity instruments results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid is deducted from equity.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the equity holders of either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Dividend payments Dividend distributions to Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by both Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders at their respective annual general meetings and interim dividends are recognised when approved by the Boards.
Special items Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and its businesses.
Such items are material by nature or amount in relation to the financial years results.

For this purpose, net pro t is fide ned as the pro t after tax and special items attributable to equity holders of the parent companies.
Diluted EPS For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of the sum of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share awards granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.
The effect of anti-dilutive potential shares is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
Underlying and headline EPS Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure.
It is included to provide an additional basis on which to measure the Groups earnings performance.
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the JSE Listings Requirements and is calculated in accordance with Circular 3 2009, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities is also affected by the use of estimation techniques.
Although the estimates used are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next financial year are disclosed below.
Estimated residual values and useful economic lives The carrying values of certain tangible xed assets are sensitive to assumptions relating to projected residual values and useful economic lives, which determine the depreciable amount and the rate at which capital expenditure is depreciated.
The Group reassesses these assumptions at least annually or more often if there are indications that they require revision.
Estimated residual values are based on available secondary market prices as at the reporting date unless estimated to be zero.
Useful economic lives are based on the expected usage, wear and tear, technical or commercial obsolescence and legal limits on the usage of capital assets.
Estimated impairment of goodwill and tangible xed assets For the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group incurred net asset impairment costs of E49 million 2010: E44 million see note 14 and goodwill impairment costs of Enil 2010: Enil see note 13.

The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and tangible xed assets are determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the exercise of managements judgement across a limited range of input assumptions and estimates.
The principal assumptions used relate to the time value of money and expected future cash ows.
The Group assesses annually whether there are any indications that items of property, plant and equipment, including assets in the course of construction, have suffered any impairment.
Indications of impairment are inherently judgemental and may require management to assess both internal and external sources of information.
Fair value of owned forestry assets For the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group recorded a fair value adjustment of E49 million 2010: E36 million.
Forestry assets as at 31 December 2011 totalled E297 million 2010: E320 million see note 15.
The Group determines the fair value based on the present value of expected net cash ows arising from its owned forestry assets, discounted at a current, market determined pre tax rate.
Managements judgement is exercised in determining the future net cash ows and the discount rate.
Future net cash ows are dependent upon inputs including expected selling prices: costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading THEL : and the factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber which in itself is dependent on a variety of environmental factors.
Net selling price is selling price after deduction of THEL costs.
The reported value of owned forestry assets would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying sensitivities: E million 2011 Effect of E1 increase in net selling price 11 Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor hectares to tonnes 3 Effect of 1% increase in discount rate 3 Retirement bene ts As at 31 December 2011 the retirement bene ts asset was E8 million 2010: E11 million and the retirement bene ts obligation was E202 million 2010: E211 million see note 26.
The Groups scheme liabilities are sensitive to changes in various underlying actuarial assumptions set by management.
These assumptions include the discount and in ation rates to apply to scheme liabilities, the mortality rates to apply to scheme members, the long-term medical cost trend rates to apply to medical schemes and the rates of increase of future salaries.
Further details regarding the assumptions are set out in note 26.
In November 2011 the trustees of the fide ned bene t pension plan in South Africa, with agreement from the participating pensioners and employees, resolved to wind up the fund subject to regulatory approval.
Regulatory approval was received in January 2012.
Mondi Limited will receive a reimbursement of the pension surplus of E6 million.
A settlement charge of E2 million will be recognised in 2012.
2 Operating segments Identi cation of the Groups externally reportable operating segments The Groups externally reportable segments re ect the internal reporting structure of the Group, which is the basis on which resource allocation decisions are made by management in the pursuit of strategic objectives.
The Group operates under two primary geographic regions re ecting its South African activities and assets, and its international, principally European, activities and assets.
The broad European region is further split by product segments re ecting the management of the Group.
In addition the Group manages the Newsprint businesses separately and therefore these have been presented as a separate segment.

Internal revenues are therefore generated across the supply chain.
Measurement of operating segment revenues, pro t and loss, assets and non-current nonfinancial assets Management has regard to certain operating segment measures in making resource allocation decisions and monitoring segment performance.
The operating segment measures required to be disclosed adhere to the recognition and measurement criteria presented in the Groups accounting policies.
In addition, the Group has presented certain non-IFRS measures by segment to supplement the users understanding.
All intra-group transactions are conducted on an arms length basis.
The Groups measure of net segment assets includes the allocation of retirement bene ts surpluses and fide cits on an appropriate basis.
The measure of segment results exclude, however, the nancing effects of the Groups fide ned bene t pension plans.
In addition, the Groups measure of net segment assets does not include an allocation for derivative assets and liabilities, nonoperating receivables and payables and assets held for sale and associated liabilities.
The measure of segment results includes the effects of certain movements in these unallocated balances.
The Groups geographic analysis is presented on the following level: continental: or sub-continental: or by individual country if greater than 10% of the Group total.
As more fully described in note 9, the Group separated its interest in Mondi Packaging South Africa through a demerger during the year ended 31 December 2011.
The results of the discontinued operation have been excluded from the segment results presented below, other than as a reconciling item between the segments totals and Group totals where appropriate, for both the years ending 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
During the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group disposed of its Merchant business, Europapier.
The results of the Merchant business are included in the Newsprint businesses segment up to its date of disposal of 4 November 2010.
As this disposal did not meet the fide nition of a discontinued operation, no restatement of segment results is permitted.
There has been no change in the basis of measurement of segment pro t and loss in the financial year.

9 Discontinued operation On 30 June 2011, the Mondi Group shareholders approved a special resolution to separate the Groups interest in Mondi Packaging South Africa MPSA via a demerger in terms of which all the ordinary shares in MPSA held by Mondi Limited were distributed to the Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders by way of a dividend in specie.
MPSA was listed on 11 July 2011 under a new name, Mpact Limited Mpact, on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited JSE.
Prior to the demerger i Mondi Limited and Shanduka Packaging Proprietary Limited Shanduka Packaging subscribed for new Mpact shares: ii certain shareholder loans made to Mpact were repaid using the cash proceeds received from the new share subscription and newly arranged borrowing facilities of Mpact: and iii the Mpact shares held by Mondi Limiteds employee share ownership trust were acquired by the Mondi Group.
The Mondi Groups shareholding in Mpact increased to 89.55% of the total number of Mpact shares in issue following these steps and Shanduka Packagings shareholding reduced to 10.45%.
The resulting interest in Mpact held by the Mondi Group was distributed to Mondi Limited shareholders by way of a dividend in specie.
The net result of the demerger on the Groups consolidated net debt position was a reduction of E172 million.
The dividend in specie declared to Mondi Limited shareholders was measured at the fair value of the Mpact shares distributed, which was E205 million.
The carrying value of the investment, immediately prior to distribution as a dividend in specie, was E170 million.
The resulting net gain on disposal of the business was E29 million, after deducting demerger costs incurred of E6 million.
The demerger and disposal of Mpact was completed during July 2011.
The gain on disposal was separately recognised as part of the discontinued operation.
Subsequent to the demerger, a consolidation of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares owned by Mondi Limited shareholders, the effect of which was to reduce their proportionate interest in the Mondi Group was undertaken in order to compensate Mondi plc shareholders for the value distributed to Mondi Limited shareholders in terms of the demerger.
The Mondi Limited share consolidation was intended to have, as far as practicable, an equivalent but not necessarily identical economic effect on Mondi plc shareholders as the economic effect that the demerger had on Mondi Limited shareholders.
The total number of new Mondi Limited ordinary shares held by Mondi Limited shareholders after the Mondi Limited share consolidation was determined by reference to the volume weighted average price VWAP of Mpact shares traded on the JSE, the VWAP of existing Mondi Limited ordinary shares traded on the JSE and the VWAP of Mondi plc ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange plc LSE and JSE, in each case during the applicable VWAP determination period, being the nine business days from 11 July 2011 to 21 July 2011.
The result of the Mondi Limited share consolidation was that the number of Mondi Limited shares in issue reduced from 147 million to 118 million and the total number of Mondi shares in issue reduced from 514 million to 486 million.

10 Earnings per share a From continuing operations As more fully described in note 9, Mondi Limiteds ordinary shares were subject to a share consolidation which was recognised from 1 August 2011, the date on which the new Mondi Limited ordinary shares commenced trading on the JSE.
The share consolidation is the matching action to compensate Mondi plc shareholders for the dividend in specie declared to Mondi Limited shareholders.
IFRS requires that the number of shares subject to the consolidation be adjusted from the effective date of the consolidation, hence, for the year under review the effect of the share consolidation is included from 1 August 2011.

11 Alternative measure of earnings per share The directors have elected to present an alternative, non-IFRS measure of earnings per share from continuing operations in order to provide shareholders with a comparison of the continuing operations of the Group as if the demerger and related share consolidation had occurred at the beginning of each period presented.
This is deemed appropriate as it is the continuing operations of the Group, after taking the impact of the share consolidation into consideration, which will be the basis of the future performance of the Group.
This approach will enable a useful comparison of earnings per share from continuing operations, based on the consolidated shares, for all future periods.
The presentation of such an alternative, non-IFRS measure of earnings per share is classi ed by the JSE Limited as pro-forma financial information.
Refer to pages 160 to 164 for the pro-forma financial information and independent reporting accountants report thereon.
In addition, the effect of the recapitalisation of Mpact resulted in a repayment of intercompany debt by Mpact to Mondi Limited on 4 and 5 July 2011 of E76 million.
These proceeds were used to reduce the Groups net debt.
The alternative measure of earnings per share has therefore been adjusted to take the related saving on interest paid into consideration as if the recapitalisation had occurred at the beginning of each period presented.
Earnings Restated E million 2011 2010 1 Underlying earnings for the financial year 340 206 2 Tax saving by Mondi Limited on intercompany interest received from Mpact 48 Saving of interest paid on net debt at 8.6% per annum 3 7 Tax at 28% on saving of interest paid 1 2 Adjusted earnings for the financial year 346 219 Notes: 1 Underlying earnings excludes the impact of special items.
2 Had the recapitalisation of Mpact occurred at the beginning of each period presented, Mondi Limited would no longer have received interest on its intercompany loans to Mpact and thus the tax charge on the interest received would not have been incurred.

The adjustment re ects the impact on the number of shares as if the share consolidation had occurred with effect from 1 January 2011 and takes treasury shares into consideration.
In 2011, the adjustment re ects the period up to the date of the share consolidation as the share consolidation is included in the basic number of ordinary shares outstanding from 1 August 2011.
2 The basic number of ordinary shares outstanding represents the weighted average number in issue for Mondi Limited and Mondi plc for the year, as adjusted for the weighted average number of treasury shares held during the year.
3 Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets covering a three year period that are based on the latest forecasts for revenue and cost as approved by the Boards and re ecting latest industry forecasts and managements expectations based on past experience.
Cash ow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts and assume a growth rate not exceeding gross domestic product for the respective countries.
Zero percent growth rates are assumed in perpetuity for most of the businesses given the commodity nature of the majority of the products i. e. volume growth is assumed to be offset by real price declines.
Post tax cash ow projections are discounted using a post tax discount rate of 7.73% 2010: 6.62%, adjusted by 0%-3% re ecting the economic and political risks of the speci c location that are not re ected in the underlying cash ows speci c to each CGU.
Maintenance capital expenditure has been assumed at 60%-80% of depreciation in the final cash ow year.
Expected future cash ows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are signi cantly affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
In respect of the CGUs that have not been impaired, sensitivity analyses of a 1% increase decrease in weighted average cost of capital, a 1% increase decrease in the growth rate applied to expected future cash ows, a 5% increase decrease in cash ows were performed and these did not give rise to an impairment.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Appropriate valuation methodologies are employed to measure the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The notional amounts presented represent the aggregate face value of all foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity price derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash ows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and therefore do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Note 38 provides an overview of the Groups management of financial risks through the selective use of derivative financial instruments and also includes a presentation of the undiscounted future contractual cash ows of the derivative contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
Hedging Cash ow hedges The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash ow hedges.
The fair value gains losses are reclassi ed from the cash ow hedge reserve to pro t and loss in the same period as when the hedged transaction affects pro t and loss.
For non-current nonfinancial assets, these gains losses are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same useful life as the cost of the asset.

A further E1,262 million 2010: E1,293 million of losses have no expiry date.
The losses attributable to Mpact in 2010 were E28 million.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on gross temporary differences of E640 million 2010: E569 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A change to UK tax legislation largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2011 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
In addition, the Group would crystallise an STC liability of approximately E10 million 2010: E20 million on ultimate distribution of the unremitted earnings of Mondi Limited to external shareholders should the distribution be approved prior to 1 April 2012.
No liability will be crystallised on distributions approved after that date.
26 Retirement bene ts The Group operates post-retirement fide ned contribution and fide ned bene t plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates post-retirement medical plans in South Africa.
The accounting policy for pensions and post-retirement bene ts is included in note 1. fide ned contribution plans The assets of the fide ned contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge, from continuing and discontinued operations, in respect of these plans of E14 million 2010: E17 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
fide ned bene t pension plans and post-retirement medical plans Only a few of the post-retirement fide ned bene t plans are funded.

The post-retirement medical plans provide health bene ts to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.

The nature of these businesses is such that adjustments to the carrying values of acquired assets and or liabilities, and to the goodwill arising on acquisition, are possible as the detail of each acquired business is evaluated post acquisition.
If necessary, these adjustments will be made within 12 months of the acquisition date.
During the year to 31 December 2011 no adjustments were made to the provisional values estimated of net assets acquired in the year to 31 December 2010.
For trade and other receivables, the gross contractual amounts receivable and the best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash ows not expected to be collected approximate the book value and the revaluation amount respectively as presented.

Total capital employed is managed on a basis that enables the Group to continue trading as a going concern, while delivering acceptable returns to shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders.
Additionally, the Group is also committed to reducing its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the future level of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase shares from shareholders, issue new equity instruments or dispose of assets to reduce its net debt exposure.
The Group reviews its total capital employed on a regular basis and makes use of several indicative ratios which are appropriate to the nature of the Groups operations and are consistent with conventional industry measures.
The principal ratios used in this review process are: gearing, fide ned as net debt divided by total capital employed: and return on capital employed, fide ned as underlying operating pro t, plus share of associates net income, before special items, divided by average capital employed.
% 2011 2010 Gearing 21.5 29.7 Return on capital employed 15.0 12.3 The Group operates a DLC structure which has been agreed with the South African Ministry of Finance and is subject to certain exchange control conditions.
The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to optimally manage its capital structure.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, is constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group has continually met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in future.

indd 150 2 2012 03 02 9:43 AM 012 03 02 9:43 AM 38 Financial risk management The Groups trading and nancing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to speci ed financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a continuous basis and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps respectively.
Although the Groups cash ows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent economic rather than residual financial risk inherent to the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates across various national boundaries and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from forecast commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and the translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange contracts The Groups foreign exchange policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency exposures against their functional currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on recognised monetary items are marked to market at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements and any such movements naturally off-set fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on the foreign currency exposures inherent in the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting dates presented, net of related foreign exchange contracts.
The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

2 Net monetary exposures represent financial assets less financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency, adjusted for the effects of foreign exchange risk hedging, excluding cash ow hedging of non-monetary assets and liabilities.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates The Group believes that for each functional to foreign currency net monetary exposure it is reasonable to assume a 5% appreciation depreciation of the functional currency.
If all other variables are held constant, the table below presents the impacts on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement if these currency movements had occurred.

It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges of non-monetary assets and liabilities are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
Interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate and has variable and xed rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Although the Group has xed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of xed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most ef ciently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most signi cant is the syndicated facility, denominated in euro see note 22.
Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are ordinarily formally designated as cash ow hedges and are fair valued at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined at each reporting date by reference to the discounted contractual future cash ows, using the relevant currency-speci c yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents also act as a natural hedge against possible unfavourable movements in the relevant inter-bank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between corporate saving and lending rates.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash out ows swapped from variable-toxed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, as denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for speci c debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk pro le of the Group as a whole.
The Group has also provided committed loan facilities to Mondi Shanduka Newsprint.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any signi cant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no signi cant geographical concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total trade receivables balance of E734 million 2010: E854 million included in trade and other receivables reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position see note 20, credit insurance covering E577 million 2010: E526 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.
The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.

The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining suf cient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities: E million 2011 2010 Expiry date In one year or less 38 44 In more than one year 851 1,437 Total credit available 889 1,481 Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash in ows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups  cash out ows, principally related to supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash in ows and out ows rests on the expected ageing pro les of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash ows that result from trade receivables and trade payables takes place typically over a period of three to four months from recognition in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash out ows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is signi cantly invested in long-term nonfinancial assets which generate the sustainable future cash in ows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
The Group also assesses its commitments under interest rate swaps, which hedge future cash ows from two to five years from the reporting date presented.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held for trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity pro le for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives are determined using standard valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on Group speci c estimates.
The signi cant inputs required to fair value all of the Groups financial instruments are observable.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments categorised as either level 1 or level 3 financial instruments.

the Groups commodity price derivatives are fair valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the present value of expected future cash ows based on observable market data.
other techniques, including discounted cash ow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.
