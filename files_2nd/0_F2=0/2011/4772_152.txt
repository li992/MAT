A final dividend of 9.77 pence per share, in respect of 2011, has been proposed by the Board.

Prior year On 15 October 2010, the Group returned a total of 63.9 million to Ordinary Shareholders equating to 1 for each Ordinary Share held following the issue of further Secured Notes.
Ordinary Shareholders were able to elect to receive this Return of Value as either: a A return of capital the Capital Option : b A special dividend the Special Dividend Option : or c A deferred income option the Deferred Dividend Option.
Ordinary Shareholders elected to receive 19.3 million as a return of capital, 44.6 million as a special dividend including 0.1 million as deferred income.
No interim dividend was paid in the year as it was included within the Return of Value.
The planned interim dividend of 4.43 pence per share which was due to be paid on 29 October 2010 was declared but cancelled following the decision to return capital to shareholders.
8Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees under the Groups SAYE Scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups LTIP Schemes.
At the balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not been met and these contingently issuable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before profit on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs, exceptional items and after taxation is a useful indication of the Groups performance, as it excludes significant nonrecurring items.
This reporting measure is defined as Underlying profit after taxation.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance.
On 8 October 2010, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation together with a Special Dividend of 1 per Ordinary Share.
The overall effect of the transaction was that of a share repurchase at fair value.
The reduction in the number of Ordinary Shares is the result of a corresponding reduction in resources.
Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Weighted average number of Per share Earnings shares amount m millions pence 52 week period ended 30 December 2011 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 34.3 54.8 62.6 Deduct: Exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and external transaction costs net of taxation of 0.2 million 4.1 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 30.2 54.8 55.1 53 week period ended 31 December 2010 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 29.0 61.8 46.9 Deduct: Exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and external transaction costs net of taxation of 0.2 million 0.3 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 28.7 61.8 46.4 In 2011 and 2010, the potential issue of new shares pursuant to the Groups share option plans would have no impact on the calculation of earnings per share.
