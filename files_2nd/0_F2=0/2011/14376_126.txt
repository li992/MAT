The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient exibility within the capital structure to fund the on-going growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements.
The Group reviews its capital structure on an on-going basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Share capital 191 191 190 Share premium 413 396 382 Treasury shares 766 778 794 Retained earnings and other reserves 3,349 2,964 2,401 3,187 2,773 2,179 118 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Accounts and other information 20.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares represents the holding of the Companys own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employees Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the share buy-back programme, which was suspended in 2008.
