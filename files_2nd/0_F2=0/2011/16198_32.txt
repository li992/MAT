Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Presumption of going concern note 19 : The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capacity and flexibility of the Group.
The Groups forecasts, taking into account reasonably possible changes as described above, show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have significant financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts.
Decommissioning costs note 22 : The costs of decommissioning are reviewed twice annually and are estimated by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
A review of all decommissioning cost estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist in 2010 which has been assessed and updated internally for the purposes of the 2011 financial statements.
Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs is based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology and price levels.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets note 22 : and Deferred tax assets are recognised for used tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Judgement is required to determine the value of the deferred tax asset, based upon the timing and level of future taxable profits.
The Group operates in a number of jurisdictions in which the tax legislation is open to interpretation.
Tax provisions, which are made based on the Groups best estimate of the amount expected to be paid, may change as agreement is reached with the relevant taxation authority.
com Notes to the Group financial statements Year ended 31 December 2011 Note 1.
Retrospective restatement During the year the Group has revised its inventory oil product valuation accounting policy to value inventory oil product at net realisable value in line with IAS 2 Inventories.
In order to aid comparability the Group has retrospectively applied the revised accounting policy.
The impact on the financial statements is summarised in the table below.
The acquisition of Nuon added a portfolio of 25 licences over 30 producing fields, a number of development and exploration opportunities and ownership of key infrastructure.
The Nuon transaction had an effective date of 1 January 2011 but completed on 30 June 2011 and this is therefore the acquisition date.
Accordingly, the financial statements include the balance sheet of Nuon including fair value adjustments.
Revenue and expenses were included within the Group income statement from 1 July 2011.
The fair value allocation to the Nuon assets is preliminary due to the finalisation of an independent review of acquired contingent resources and will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The purchase consideration equals the aggregate of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Nuon and therefore no goodwill has been recorded on the acquisition.
Deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the fair value adjustments as applicable.
Provisional fair value $m Intangible exploration and appraisal assets 424.1 Property, plant and equipment 539.6 Trade and other receivables 19.8 Trade and other payables 20.0 Deferred tax liabilities 472.9 Provisions 86.6 Total consideration satisfied by cash 404.0 Transaction costs in respect of the Nuon acquisition of $1.1 million have been recognised in the income statement.
From the date of the acquisition, Nuon has contributed $67.6 million to Group revenues and $3.2 million to the profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been $2,384.3 million and group profit would have been $695.4 million.
There were no acquisitions involving business combinations in 2010 or 2009.

Segmental reporting In the opinion of the Directors the operations of the Group comprise one class of business, oil and gas exploration, development and production and the sale of hydrocarbons and related activities.
In 2011 the Group reorganised its operational structure into three regions so that the management and resources of the business are aligned with the delivery of business objectives.
The reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8 are therefore now the three geographical regions that the Group operates within, being Europe, South America and Asia: West and North Africa and South and East Africa.
The following tables present revenue, profit and certain asset and liability information regarding the Groups business segments for the year ended 31 December 2011, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.

132 Tullow Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 The Groups profit before taxation will continue to be subject to jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $1,082.3 million 2010: $840.1 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised $117.5 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2010: $175.1 million.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $253.0 million 2010: $485.6 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Included within 2011 additions is $128.8 million of capitalised interest 2010: $30.7 million, 2009: $17.5 million.
The Group only capitalises interest in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets where it is considered that development is highly likely and advanced appraisal and development is ongoing.
Additions in 2010 include $1,450 million in relation to the acquisition of a 50% stake in Blocks 1 and 3A in Uganda.

The carrying amount of the Groups oil and gas assets includes an amount of $nil million 2010: $346.7 million, 2009: $13.5 million in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The 2011 impairment loss relates to the MBoundi field in Congo 2010: Chinguetti field in Mauritania, 2009: Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
The recoverable amount was determined by estimating its value in use.
In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including an oil price assumption equal to the forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and $80 per barrel 2010: $80 per barrel thereafter and a post-tax discount rate assumption of 10% the MBoundi field operates in a Production Sharing Contract regime under which tax is deducted at source and included within the Governments share of profit oil 2010: Chinguetti, 15% pre-tax.
In 2011 an impairment reversal of $17.4 million has been recorded in respect of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania as a result of increased proven and probable reserves estimates arising from improved field performance.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
On 25 July 2011, Tullow completed the acquisition of the Ghanaian interests of EO Group Limited EO for a combined cash and share consideration of $305 million and $9.9 million of working capital adjustments to acquire an additional 3.5% share in the West Cape Three Points licence and 1.75% in the Jubilee field.
The consideration was allocated between oil and gas assets $282.9 million and intangible exploration and evaluation assets $32.0 million.

This designation required Tullow to pay a recoverable security of $313.5 million to the URA.
This sum is equivalent to the outstanding Capital Gains Tax that the Ugandan Government believes it is owed by Heritage.
Separately, and under the terms of Tullow and Heritages PSA, Tullow has opened proceedings against Heritage in London to recover this sum.

Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2011.
com Notes to the Group financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 Note 19.
Financial liabilities continued The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.

140 Tullow Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $650 million Revolving Credit Facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2014.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2011, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $826 million: $176 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $650 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2010, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $685 million: $175 million under the $2.5 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $510 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the end of December 2009, the headroom under the two facilities was $620 million: $370 million under the $2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility and $250 million under the Revolving Corporate Facility.
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2011 is $7.2 million out of the money 2010: $13.6 million and 2009: $8.9 million out of the money.
The interest rate hedges are included in the fixed rate debt in the above table.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2011 year end 2010: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2011, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were 106.0 million $163.8 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2010: 106.0 million and 2009: $1,337.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $163.8 million 2010: net liabilities of $164.0 million and 2009: net liabilities of $1,337.0 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2011, a 20% increase in foreign exchange rates against the functional currencies of entities in the Group would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $27.3 million 2010: $27.3 million and 2009: $226.7 million and a 20% decrease in foreign exchange rates against the functional currencies of entities in the Group would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $32.8 million 2010: $32.8 million and 2009 $339.9 million.
Financial liabilities continued Liquidity risk The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
The Group predominantly sells to large oil and gas multinationals and no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable.
Fair values of derivative instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in such fair value between accounting periods being recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.
The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices marked-to-market values where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: Less than One to Total 31 December 2011 one year three years 2011 Assets Liabilities $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 10.0 33.1 43.1 Gas derivatives 0.4 1.1 1.5 Interest rate derivatives 4.0 3.0 7.0 5.6 29.0 34.6 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 47.7 32.9 80.6 Gas derivatives 0.3 0.3 0.6 48.0 33.2 81.2 Total liabilities 42.4 4.2 46.6 Less than One to Total 31 December 2010 one year three years 2010 Liabilities $m $m $m Cash flow hedges Oil derivatives 12.7 4.9 17.6 Gas derivatives 7.0 7.3 14.3 Interest rate derivatives 8.4 5.2 13.6 28.1 17.4 45.5 Deferred premium Oil derivatives 18.7 17.8 36.5 Gas derivatives 0.3 0.1 0.4 19.0 17.9 36.9 Total liabilities 47.1 35.3 82.4 143 www.

Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
144 Tullow Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Oil and gas prices The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and gas revenues.
Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil hedges H1 2012 H2 2012 2013 2014 Volume bopd 34,500 34,500 21,000 10,000 Average Price $ bbl 105.63 103.85 100.84 96.83 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2011 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date.

As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
Financial instruments continued Income statement hedge summary Losses from settlements during the period amounted to $69.8 million 2010: $3.4 million gain note 4 and these are included in the revenue line.

The movement for the period in the hedge reserve is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Revaluation losses on open contracts arising during the year amounted to $6.7 million while reclassification adjustments for losses included in profit on realisation amounted to $15.2 million.

Oil and gas sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being dated Brent oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices.
The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: The pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market MTM evaluations: The price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges: and The sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material component of the MTM oil and gas hedges.
As at 31 December 2011, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity only adjusting the intrinsic value element by approximately $17.8 million 2010: $21.8 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $7.2 million 2010: $5.9 million.
As at 31 December 2011, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased equity by approximately $3.3 million 2010: $8.6 million, a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately $2.0 million 2010: $3.4 million.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2011, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of $7.2 million 2010: $13.6 million : a 25bps increase in the underlying interest rate would increase equity by approximately $0.5 million 2010: $1.2 million.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production.
The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been initiated.
The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December 2011 was $1,254.2 million 2010: $1,153.0 million.

The average remaining lease term as at 2010 was 10 years and 2009: two years.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the effective borrowing rate was 14% 2009: 2.8%.
The decrease during the year is due to the Jubilee FPSO Kwame Nkrumah being derecognised as a finance lease as it was acquired from the lessor by the Jubilee field unit partners, a $22.3 million gain was recognised in finance income in respect of this transaction.

A review of all decommissioning estimates was undertaken by an independent specialist in 2010 which has been assessed and updated internally for the purposes of the 2011 financial statements.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

148 Tullow Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
