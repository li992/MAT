The total pension accrued at the end of the year is the amount that the Director had accrued when the Scheme ceased to offer future accrual at30June 2009 plus revaluation in line with the Scheme rules.
The inflation figure of 4.6% is based on the change in RPI from September 2009 to September 2010, consistent with previous years.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Value Amendment Regulations 2008.
The transfer values of the accrued pension represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and its Directors, such as market movements.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
Except as disclosed in respect of Clive Fenton on pages 54 and 56, none of the Directors have any rights under the Companys money purchase pension scheme.
There were no changes in the interests of the Directors shown above between 30 June 2011 and 13 September 2011.
The Remuneration report was approved by the Board on 13 September 2011 and signed on its behalf by: Robert Davies NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 13 September 2011 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 59
