Operating segments The Groups organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis.
The Groups operating segments follow this structure, however, where operating segments exhibit similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature they are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
The Groups reportable operating segments are Performance Analysis, Service Assurance and Systems.
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before share-based payment, acquired intangible asset amortisation, acquisition related costs and exceptional items, although there were no exceptional items in 2011 or 2010.
Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate assets comprise cash and cash equivalents held for central treasury purposes and other corporate assets.
Information on segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and is therefore not disclosed below.
