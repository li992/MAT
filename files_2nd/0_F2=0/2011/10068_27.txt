Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments which are recognised at fair value, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Directors statement of going concern on page 48 of the Directors report.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration paid.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the investment to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Depreciation of fixtures and fittings is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of the assets being three to twelve years.
The estimated useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
A tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the Profit and Loss Account in the year the item is derecognised.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions and shortterm deposits which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the Balance Sheet at cost and subsequently remeasured to their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on whether the derivative contract is designed to hedge a specific risk and qualifies for hedge accounting.
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge, or b a hedge of a forecast transaction or firm commitment cash flow hedge or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which are fair value hedges and that are highly effective are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Where the forecasted transaction or firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the gains and losses previously included in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
Otherwise, amounts recorded in equity are transferred to the Profit and Loss Account and classified as revenue or expense in the same period in which the forecasted transaction affects the Profit and Loss Account.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
The Company hedges certain net investments in foreign operations with foreign currency borrowings.
All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation are recognised in equity and included in cumulative translation differences and are recycled through the Profit and Loss Account upon derecognition of the hedged item.

Significant accounting policies continued Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic hedges under the Companys policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account along with any ineffectiveness on cash flow and net investment hedges.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: Share-based payments.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the BlackScholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Cash Flow Statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 Revised : Cash Flow Statements because it prepares a consolidated Cash Flow Statement which is shown on page 65 of the Group financial statements.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance Sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Profits and losses on exchange arising in the normal course of trading and realised exchange differences arising on the conversion of foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised within the Profit and Loss Account.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account for the year.

The Company has unused tax losses of approximately 7.3 million 31 December 2010: 19.7 million available to carry forward and offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to uncertainty over future taxable profits arising in the foreseeable future.
The estimated value of the deferred tax asset not recognised at a tax rate of 25% 31 December 2010: 27% is 1.8 million 31 December 2010: 5.3 million.
