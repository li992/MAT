58 Accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 The Groups investment in Northern Star Mining Corp has been fully provided for as a result of Northern Star Mining Corps shares being suspended from trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange on January 25, 2011 following the announcement of its filing for bankruptcy.
The Group ranks equally with all other shareholders and continues to pursue the recovery of its share of funds to be returned to shareholders by the trustee in bankruptcy.
As at September 30, 2010, the Group concluded it had lost significant influence over Royalco Resources Limited Royalco despite maintaining a 32.03% equity interest and having a common director.
This conclusion was reached following the Groups inability to influence significant financial and operational policy decisions made by Royalco, together with losing its ability to obtain timely financial information.
On losing significant influence over Royalco, the Groups 32.03% equity interest was remeasured to its fair value of 4,151,000 being the closing market price of Royalcos shares quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange as at September 30, 2010.
The remeasurement to fair value resulted in a gain of 498,000 being recognised in the income statement.
In addition a gain of 40,000 previously recognised in other comprehensive income was reclassified to the income statement.
Despite maintaining a 33.78% 2010: 32.03% equity interest in Royalco Resources Limited Royalco and having a common director, the Group continues to be unable to influence significant financial and operation policy decision made by Royalco.
As a result the Group continues to conclude that it does not have significant influence over Royalco and consistent with 2010 continues to include its investment in Royalco in available-for-sale mining and exploration interests.
Group Company b Fair value through profit and loss 000 000 At January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 248 248 A non-repayable convertible instrument was acquired by the Group in 2007.
The convertible instrument was designated as fair value through profit or loss.
This convertible instrument was created to provide finance to a listed mining development company and is convertible into equity in the company or royalties over the companys properties at the Groups option for a period of up to five years.
The instrument was initially recognised using cost as fair value could not be reliably determined.
The Group considers that there had been no material change in the fair value of the instrument at the reporting date, and this will be re-examined on a regular basis considering factors such as the presence of an active market for the equity and valuations of the potential royalty streams.
The Group has no present intention of exercising the conversion of the instrument in the next 12 months.
