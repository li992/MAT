OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 171 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying xed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below: UK regulatory basis Required capital for the life business is based on FSA rules.
Society must hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts: the first being calculated using the FSA rules specified by the Regulator pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the Company which is reviewed by the FSA pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying xed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modied by the FSA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using FSA pillar 1 and pillar 2 requirements.
The pillar 1 calculation applies xed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied in this business.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk prole.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is dened by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual rms, the Group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
Available regulatory capital resources Capital resources available to meet regulatory UK capital requirements are determined using FSA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules are based on UK GAAP, adjusted for admissibility, counterparty exposure limits and specic valuation differences.
The Groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the different sources of capital held within the Group.
The Groups total available capital resources, based on unaudited FSA returns, are 6.0bn 2010: 5.9bn of which 4.1bn 2010: 4.5bn is held by the life businesses.
The use of capital held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained by local regulatory requirements, and may not be available to provide funding for other businesses.
The total available capital resources of the Groups with-profits business with-profits estate is determined in accordance with the Realistic Balance Sheet rules prescribed by the FSA.
At 31 December 2011, the realistic value of the UK participating liabilities was 14.6bn 2010: 15.3bn under the FSA realistic capital regime.
The excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities was 0.7bn 2010: 1.0bn.
The capital resources reect the surplus in that part of the fund which is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
The liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.
