Overview Business review Corporate governance report Financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Groups operations are managed and reported internally on a divisional basis that reflects the different characteristics of each business.
These divisions have been disclosed as reportable segments because they are the components that the Board monitors regularly in making decisions about operating matters such as allocating resources to businesses and assessing performance.
Each division has its own managing director who reports directly to the Chief Executive.
The principal financial information reviewed by the Board, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker, is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis.
The Groups segments are: Currency provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and banknote security features Cash Processing Solutions primarily focused on the production of large sorters for central banks, complementing the Currency business Security Products produces security documents, including authentication labels and tax stamps Identity Systems involved in the production of passports, including ePassports, together with other secure identity products Cash Processing Security Identity Exceptional Currency Solutions Products Systems items Total 2011 m m m m m m Total revenue 289.0 57.4 63.3 62.8 472.5 Less: Inter segment revenue 0.6 8.0 8.6 Revenue 288.4 57.4 55.3 62.8 463.9 Operating profit before exceptional items 28.5 0.5 9.0 2.4 40.4 Exceptional items operating note 3 29.0 13.4 15.6 Operating profit loss 0.5 0.5 9.0 2.4 13.4 24.8 Profit on sale of associated undertaking 55.1 Net interest expense 3.8 Retirement benefit obligations net finance expense 3.3 Profit before taxation 72.8 Segment assets 197.1 35.3 23.9 53.7 310.0 Unallocated assets 115.5 Total assets 425.5 Segment liabilities 106.2 22.6 10.8 28.2 167.8 Unallocated liabilities 240.9 Total liabilities 408.7 Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment 6.1 0.8 1.7 14.6 23.2 Capital expenditure on intangible assets 2.3 2.7 2.0 7.0 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 15.8 2.1 2.4 2.9 23.2 Amortisation of intangible assets 0.4 0.6 0.2 1.2 Inter segmental transactions are carried out on an arms length basis and eliminated upon consolidation.

These changes result in a reduction in the pension liabilities.
The Group has identified paper production quality and certification issues as more fully described in note 27: Contingent liabilities.
Provision has been made for the costs associated with the issues identified at this stage and which include the write off of inventories and trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation and rectification of these matters.
Provision has not been made for the potential costs of resolutions or for potential fines from regulatory authorities.
The nature and extent of these resolutions and potential fines will be the subject of ongoing discussion, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present.
Corporate costs of 2.6m were incurred in relation to the engagement of legal and professional advisors following a takeover approach for the Group.
The profit arising on the sale of an associated undertaking is in respect of the sale of the Groups share in Camelot, the UK national lottery operator, which was completed on 8 July 2010.
The gain shown represents the consideration received of 77.6m, net of expenses, and the cost of investment.
Exceptional charges of 7.5m in the prior year represent the resolution of a legacy overseas indirect tax issue and the reorganisation of CPS.
Reorganisation costs principally comprised redundancy charges and rationalisation of products and site capabilities.
Tax credits relating to exceptional items arising in the year were 1.1m 2010: 1.0m.
In addition, there was also an exceptional tax credit of 2.5m in respect of the determination of the tax treatment of prior year exceptional items 2010: 1.4m prior year credit.

A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2011 2010 m m Currency 4.3 4.3 Cash Processing Solutions 3.5 3.6 7.8 7.9 The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and Cash Processing Solutions on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
The estimates of recoverable amount are based on value in use calculations which are based on cash flow projections covering a five year period based on the 2011 12 budget plus a terminal year.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Currency: The volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i Expectations in respect of economic growth and central banks banknote circulation policies ii The Groups knowledge of its customer base, gained through its long standing relationships with them Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom available in the calculations.
b Cash Processing Solutions: Unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales are based on a combination of orders on hand and past experience The pre tax discount rate used for both Currency and Cash Processing Solutions was 13.4 per cent 2010: 13.4 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations.
The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior year, reflecting the fact that the Groups WACC has not changed and the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not materially changed.
Cash flows beyond the period covered by the projections have been held constant.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that could result in the assets recoverable amounts falling below their book values.

fide La Rue Annual Report 2011 70 Overview Business review Corporate governance report Financial statements 14 Financial instruments Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Currency risk Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to each of the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of capital are set out below.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established the Risk Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups risk management policies.
The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Internal Audit function.
The Internal Audit function undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.
Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
fide La Rue Annual Report 2011 71 Notes to the accounts continued 14 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of debt above 50m on a continuing basis, floating to fixed interest rate swaps will be used to fix the interest rate on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing.
The Board of Directors monitors earnings per share, which the Group defines as the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The Board also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.

The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges that was recognised in the Income Statement was a gain of 0.5m 2010: nil.
Fair value measurement basis for derivative financial instruments The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values.
Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject to management estimates.
Determination of fair values of derivative financial instruments Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of embedded derivatives is shown within revenue or operating expenses as appropriate, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Determination of fair values of non derivative financial assets and liabilities Trade and other receivables and payables Due to their short maturities, trade and other payables, and trade and other receivables have been stated at their book values which approximate their fair values.
Non derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on sterling LIBOR.
At 26 March 2011 the discount rate used was 1.0 per cent 2010: 1.0 per cent.

Where the Group has forecast average levels of net debt above 50m on a continuing basis, Group policy is to maintain a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups average net debt fixed for a period of at least 12 months.
The Group has reduced its exposure to cash flow interest rate risk through interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of 50m, which have the effect of fixing the interest cost on 50m of borrowings under the Groups committed bank facility until May 2011 at an average rate of 1.74 per cent against receipt of 1 month LIBOR.
As at 26 March 2011 50m of the interest rate swaps were treated as ineffective because of reduced levels of sterling debt.
The cumulative fair value of these swaps has been shown in the Income Statement.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of 3.2m 2010: 2.5m in respect of losses amounting to 12.6m 2010: 9.8m that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Unremitted earnings totalled 429.3m at 26 March 2011 2010: 558.9m.
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of 337.0m are carried forward at 26 March 2011 2010: 337.0m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
UK tax rate Finance No 2 Act 2010 was substantively enacted on 27 July 2010 and included legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28 per cent to 27 per cent from 1 April 2011.
For the year ended 26 March 2011, as the reduction in statutory rate by 1 per cent has been substantively enacted, deferred tax has been recognised on the Balance Sheet at 27 per cent and therefore the UK deferred tax liabilities assets have been reduced accordingly.
A further reduction to the main rate was announced in the 2011 Budget on 23 March 2011 reducing the rate by an additional 1 per cent to 26 per cent from April 2011.
This will be substantively enacted after 26 March 2011 and therefore has not been reflected in the deferred tax figures on the Balance Sheet.

The Plan is a combination of three elements: deferred allocation, dividend allocation and matching allocation.
The matching allocation is linked to the deferred allocation and is subject to the following performance condition: up to 50 per cent of the award is released subject to an earnings per share test and up to 50 per cent is released based on the performance of the total shareholder return test TSR against the companies in the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The performance conditions are described in more detail on page 49.

Executive Share Option Plan The Executive Share Option Plan was open to eligible senior executives around the Group.
Options were granted at a price equal to the average market price of a share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target.
The performance condition relates to the achievement over three years of 3 per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse.

The mortality assumptions used to assess the defined benefit obligation for the UK plan are based on tables issued by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
At 26 March 2011 and 27 March 2010 mortality assumptions were based on the PxA92 birth year tables multiplied by a rating of 125 per cent and allowance for medium cohort mortality improvements in future, with a 0.5 per cent mortality improvement underpin.
The resulting life expectancy for a 65 year old pensioner is 20.6 years 2010: 20.5 years.
In July 2010, the UK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases both for pensions in payment and pensions in deferment to apply to private sector pension schemes.
This has resulted in a small actuarial gain during the period in respect of the fide La Rue pension plans in the UK.

While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made to cover these matters.
In July 2010 the Board commissioned an investigation by external lawyers into issues that had been brought to its attention internally.
The investigation, which was completed in October 2010, found nothing of substance to support the matters raised other than in respect of some paper production issues where it was found that a small number of the many detailed specification parameters of some paper had fallen marginally short of specification.
It was also established that certain paper specification test certificates had been deliberately falsified.
The Board reported the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, who are considering the matter, and is implementing a number of measures arising from the findings of the investigation.
Provision, as described in note 3: Exceptional items, has been made for the costs associated with the paper production issues identified at this stage, including the write off of inventories and trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation and rectification of these matters.
The nature and extent of these resolutions will be the subject of ongoing discussions, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present.
The timing, response and outcome of the consideration by the authorities of the reported findings of the investigation and rectification is also uncertain and the financial consequences, if any, cannot be estimated reliably at present.
