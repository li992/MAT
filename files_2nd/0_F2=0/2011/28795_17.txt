In June 2010, a number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the budget statement.
2 Act 2010 was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010 and includes reducing the corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate were announced in March 2011 to reduce the rate further to 26% from 1 April 2011 and by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The proposed reductions post 2011 are to be separately enacted.
As these changes to the main rate were not substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, their impact is not included within the deferred tax balance as at 31 March 2011.

In a number of cases the Group owns more than 50% of a particular class of shares issued by an investee company or partnership interests totalling more than 50%.
The Group does not hold more than 50% of the voting rights of any of its investee companies or partnerships.
As such, holding more than 50% of a particular class of shares does not give the Group control of any the investee companies or partnerships within the meaning of IAS 27.
The Group has chosen to account for associated companies which they hold for investment purposes at fair value through the profit and loss in accordance with IAS 28.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Three-year credit facility On 22 December 2010 the Company signed a new three-year US Dollar 400 million credit facility with National Australia Bank.
The facility was drawn in full on 6 January 2011.
While the facility has the ability to be drawn and repaid over short periods and therefore is disclosed in current liabilities it is viewed as providing medium-term structural gearing.
The facility pays variable interest linked to three-month US Dollar LIBOR.
Following the drawdown, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps with the effect of fixing the interest rate at an average of 3.43% until December 2013.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Provisions in respect of investments include 2.0 million 31 March 2010: 1.7 million which are expected to settle within the next twelve months.
It is anticipated that all of the other provisions noted above will be settled more than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Indemnity provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2011 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been calculated by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
In respect of segregated accounts where performance criteria have been exceeded at the end of the year, the value of the associated performance fee payable to the manager has been provided for under current liabilities.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.3 million as at 31 March 2011 31 March 2010: 0.2 million.
Long-term incentive plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a phantom option scheme: the Share Appreciation Rights SAR plan.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, certain Directors and employees are entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to a notional number of shares in the Company and therefore the scheme is accounted for as a cash-settled scheme in accordance with IFRS 2.
The bonus amount payable would be equal to the increase, since the date of grant of the relevant SARs, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares, provided the relevant performance conditions are met: the provision also includes the corresponding employers national insurance liability.
The SARs can be exercised between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The provision can be analysed by reference to the date of grant of the relevant SARs as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 million million Date of grant 25 March 2004 0.1 0.1 30 March 2005 0.1 0.1 15 March 2006 0.1 0.0 15 March 2007 0.9 0.5 27 March 2008 0.1 13 March 2009 2.8 2.0 24 June 2009 0.7 0.4 19 October 2009 0.1 0.1 26 March 2010 1.0 0.1 Intrinsic value of all SARs 5.9 3.3 IFRS 2 adjustment to provision 1.1 1.0 Carrying amount of SAR provision 4.8 2.3 Intrinsic value of SARs vested as at 31 March 1.2 0.7 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 66 The Company has used a trinomial option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the SARs.
The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 20% 31 March 2010: 21%, dividends of 4.0p 31 March 2010: 4.0p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate based on the Sterling Benchmark Swap Curve.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Longterm Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 35.
To allow for the effects of early exercise and staff turnover, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised four and a half years after the relevant grant dates.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of these SARs was 8.5 years.
Included in the outstanding amount at year-end were SARs representing a notional number of 337,683 shares, which had vested and were capable of being exercised.
These had exercise prices ranging between 575p and 1,122p with a weighted average of 948.7p.
During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Company granted 663,000 SARs 2010: 713,073 and the weighted average fair value of those SARs was 244.0p 31 March 2010: 255.0p.
The Company recognised an expense of 3.5 million 31 March 2010: income of 2.8 million arising from the SAR plan.

Under the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, sums standing to the credit of the capital reserve are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of any issue of the Companys own shares.
The Company may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales TECH 01 08 realised capital reserves comprise gains and losses on realisation of investments together with changes in fair value of investments which are considered to be readily convertible into cash without accepting adverse terms.
At the year-end all of the listed investments were considered to be sufficiently liquid to be regarded as readily convertible into cash, however the unlisted investments were not.
Accordingly, the split of capital reserve between realised and unrealised in order to determine distributable realised profits was as follows: Year ended 31 March 2011 Year ended 31 March 2010 Group Company Group Company million million million million Capital reserve distributable in respect of investments sold 1,527.1 1,513.9 1,515.5 1,501.6 in respect of listed investments held 81.2 81.0 25.5 25.5 Capital reserve non-distributable 125.1 111.7 26.0 13.5 Balance at year-end 1,733.4 1,706.6 1,567.0 1,540.6 23.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As an investment company, financial instruments make up the vast majority of the Groups financial position and generate its performance.
The Group holds investments in a variety of financial instruments in order to meet its investment objective to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
Asset allocation is determined by the executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
The assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares, partnership interests and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives.
The investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss FVPL : cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: long-term borrowings used to enhance returns: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group in accordance with the Groups investment objectives, and to manage market risks and currency risks.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date and the risk management policies employed by the Group are discussed below.

In relation to debtors, creditors and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 March 2011 this amounted to 249.0 million 31 March 2010: 288 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during 2011 or 2010 by the Group or the Company.
26.2 Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, and is described in more detail below.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.
Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three types of risk: Price risk b. below The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest rate risk c. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency risk d. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective and the investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the executive Directors and senior management.
The Company complies with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets and currencies by taking positions in currency forward contracts, index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those currencies or particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to price risk and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.
The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
The performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to pricing risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including relevant derivatives, as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 million million Exposure to price risk 1,920.6 1,730.5 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 74 As at the year-end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 96.8% of net assets 31 March 2010: 95.3%.
Price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS with regards to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 March 31 March 2011 2010 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 192.1 178.1 c. Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups investments in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of interest rate risk The executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as a hedge of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to interest rate risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.
31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total million million million million million million Portfolio investments debt securities 33.6 248.2 281.8 69.7 169.9 239.6 Derivative financial instruments 1.4 1.4 3.9 0.9 3.0 Cash 65.6 65.6 115.3 115.3 Bank loans and overdrafts: due within one year 249.0 249.0 157.6 157.6 due after more than one year 133.6 133.6 Total Exposure 99.2 2.2 97.0 188.9 122.2 66.7 75 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Group arising out of investment, borrowing and risk management processes.
Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
The Group has total borrowings of 249.0 million outstanding at the year-end 31 March 2010: 290.3 million.
The credit facility comprising this total, incurs fixed interest payments through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 200 basis points annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities are not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant A 200 basis points decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 March 31 March 2011 2010 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 2.0 3.8 d. Currency risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of currency risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar investments is also hedged by way of the Companys borrowings denominated in this currency.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS in regard to changes in key currencies is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% strengthening of Sterling relative to the foreign currencies as at 31 March, and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% weakening is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the net foreign currency assets held at the balance sheet dates and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.

Credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of credit risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Using a large number of brokers Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to highly rated government securities A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if the counterparty were unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group has exposure to certain debt instruments acquired as part of its private equity transactions.
The credit risk associated with these instruments is managed as part of the overall investment risk in the relevant portfolio companies and is not considered separately.
Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was: 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 million million Portfolio investments debt securities 243.9 233.1 Derivative financial instruments 23.8 42.3 Other receivables 7.6 14.0 Sales for future settlement 11.3 4.9 Cash at bank 65.6 115.3 Maximum exposure to credit risk 352.2 409.6 79 26.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Substantially all of the listed portfolio investments are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed: however, the custodians subordinated debt was rated A by Fitch in the most recent rating prior to 31 March 2011. f. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in and commitments to unquoted companies and unquoted funds which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to be realised.
Management of liquidity risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.
Exposure to liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.
The Group has a credit facility totalling 249.0 million details of which are disclosed in Note 18.
The Groups contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year-end, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required are as follows: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 3 months 3-12 3 months 3-12 or less months 1 year Total or less months 1 year Total million million million million million million million million Current liabilities: Bank loan overdraft 249.0 249.0 157.6 157.6 Other liabilities 43.7 43.7 47.3 47.3 Non-current liabilities: Bank loans 133.6 133.6 Other liabilities 1.0 1.0 5.3 5.3 Total 292.7 1.0 293.7 204.9 138.9 343.8 Commitments 145.8 145.8 241.6 241.6 Total 438.5 1.0 439.5 446.5 138.9 585.4 26.3 Collateral Collateral is posted by the Group in relation to derivative transactions.
These are transacted under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and may require collateral to be posted from time to time.
The Group does not hold collateral from other counterparties.
Set out below is the amount of financial assets pledged as collateral.
31 March 31 March 2011 2010 million million Cash collateral provided by RIT in relation to derivative contracts 22.9 62.5 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 80 26.4 Derivative financial instruments The Group typically uses the following types of derivative instruments in the portfolio: Futures and forward contracts relating to foreign currencies, market indices and bonds Options relating to foreign currencies, market indices, equities and interest rates Swaps relating to interest rates, credit spreads and equity indices As explained above, the Group uses derivatives to hedge various exposures and also selectively to increase or decrease exposure where desired.
The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to the derivatives terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

These are as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3 The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
Where adjustments have been required to quoted prices to arrive at fair value, or where a market price is available but the market is not considered active, the Directors have classified these investments as level 2.
The Directors consider all unquoted direct investments and unquoted funds as described in pages 14 to 17 of the Investment Review as level 3 assets, as the valuations of these assets are not based on observable market data.
Where funds within the absolute return and real asset categories invest into illiquid stocks, these are also considered by the Group to be level 3 assets.

All these conditions were met during this and the previous financial year.
In addition, one of the Companys subsidiaries is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Financial Services Authority and that subsidiary must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the requirements as set out by the Financial Services Authority.
The subsidiary was in compliance with those capital requirements throughout the year.

PENSION COMMITMENTS J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme consists of a defined benefit section which is closed to new members.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trusteeadministered fund.
Under IAS19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2012 will be 0.8 million although this is currently under review as part of the actuarial valuation 31 March 2011: 0.8 million.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
The full actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out as at 1 January 2008 was updated to 31 March 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
A subsequent actuarial valuation is currently in progress.
PENSION COMMITMENTS CONTINUED The main financial assumptions are shown in the following tables: At At 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.55% 5.70% Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued before 5 April 1997 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued after 6 April 1997 4.25% 4.30% Inflation assumption Retail Price Index 3.50% 3.65% The mortality assumptions employed as at 31 March 2011 are based on the tables set out below and include allowance for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2009 CMI projections with a long term trend of 1.5% per annum.
Member status Pre-Retirement Post-Retirement Active AM FC 00 SAPS light series year of birth table allowing for CMI projection and a 1.5% per annum long term trend Deferred AM FC 00 SAPS light series year of birth table allowing for CMI projection and a 1.5% per annum long term trend Pensioners N A SAPS light series year of birth table allowing for CMI projection and a 1.5% per annum long term trend It is assumed that 70% of members are married as at the date of death.
As at 31 March 2011, the expected rate of return on the Schemes assets was 8.3% per annum 31 March 2010: 7.5% per annum.
This rate is equal to the weighted average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the asset classes in which the Scheme was invested in at 31 March 2011.
The fair value of the assets held by the defined benefit scheme, the long-term expected rate of return on each class of assets and the value of the Schemes liabilities assessed on the assumptions described above are shown in the following table: Long-term Long-term rate of return Value at rate of return Value at expected at 31 March expected at 31 March 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 2011 million 2010 million Equities 9.00% 11.2 9.00% 9.7 Alternative investments 7.00% 2.8 7.00% 3.0 Corporate bonds 5.00% 1.0 5.00% 0.5 Cash 2.00% 0.2 3.00% 0.5 Fair value of the Schemes assets 15.2 13.7 Present value of the Schemes liabilities 14.7 13.7 Surplus in the Scheme 0.5 0.0 The surplus of the Scheme for the year ended 31 March 2011 was 463,000 31 March 2010: 3,000.
