IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
The Group is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its financial position and performance.
This standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.

s Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 1 revenue recognition In making its judgement, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from permanent placements where a position has been accepted by a candidate, a start date agreed, but employment has not yet commenced.
A provision is made by management, based on past historical experience, for the proportion of those placements where the candidate is expected to reverse their acceptance prior to the start date.

5. non-Recurring Items nRI vAT In 2003, Michael Page submitted an initial claim to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC for overpaid VAT which was rejected.
Michael Page appealed and subsequently filed amended claims for 26.5m, net of fees, covering the period from 1980 to 2004.
In March 2009, Michael Page filed amended claims for a further refund of an additional 80m, net of fees, of overpaid VAT covering the same period.
In June 2009, Michael Page received a payment from HMRC of 26.5m, net of fees, as part settlement of these claims and in July 2009 received 10.5m, net of fees, of statutory interest.
As a result, the principal and interest amounts were recognised in the June 2009 half year results.
On 25 September 2009, Michael Page received a letter from HMRC which stated that, HMRC have reviewed the recent payment and are now of the view that the claim in whole or in part should not have been paid.
A number of discussions and meetings with HMRC then took place and on 5 March 2010, Michael Page International plc MPI announced that an agreement had been reached in principle, subject to legal contract, between MPI and HMRC in respect of the initial claim for a refund of overpaid VAT plus statutory interest to retain 28.4m net of fees of the 37.4m it received.
However, given the background to the initial receipt and the subsequent review and reversal of its decision by HMRC, the Group reversed out the balances originally recognised in the 2009 half year results and as such did not recognise any amount in the Income Statement at the 2009 full year, due to the remaining uncertainty pending formal contractual agreement.
On 30 April 2010, a formal agreement was signed with HMRC.
As a result, of the 50m originally received from HMRC, MPI retained 38m and returned 11.9m in May 2010.
Accordingly, after fees, MPI recognised 28.4m as non-recurring income in the prior year 2010 Income Statement.
Taxation of 8.0m on non-recurring items, net of expenses, was also provided in 2010, representing an effective tax rate of 28.0%.
During the year, we had correspondence and discussions with HMRC concerning the amended claims for a further refund of VAT and related interest, but the eventual outcome still remains uncertain.

The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2010 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 6.75p 2010: 6.12p per ordinary share will be paid on 6 June 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 4 May 2012, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: earnings 2011 2010 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 56,857 67,484 Non-recurring items NRI 000 note 5 20,491 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share before NRI 000 56,857 46,993 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 304,458 311,821 Dilution effect of share plans 000 7,941 7,653 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 312,399 319,474 Basic earnings per share pence 18.7 21.6 18.2 Diluted earnings per share pence 21.1 Basic earnings per share before NRI pence 18.7 15.1 Diluted earnings per share before NRI pence 18.2 14.7 The above results relate to continuing operations.
87 FiNANCiAl STATeMeNTS Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust and held in the reserve.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.

Management applied a discount rate of 10%, representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, to the estimated future cash flows to calculate the terminal value of those cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2011 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax, but should not be liable to UK tax if they were to be distributed as dividends.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 20.7m 2010: 8.2m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 1.5m is dependent on generating future taxable profits.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 0.4m is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.

All options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.

No awards were made under the ESOS scheme in 2009 or 2011.
The 2009 grant made under the SOS plan is subject to a performance condition that will be tested, ESOS plan details initially, three years after the date of grant and then annually until either the entire grant has vested, or ten years from the date of the award have elapsed, in which case any awards outstanding under Note 1 Pre flotation options the grant will lapse.
The performance condition is directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
If On flotation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors Operating Profit is 30m then 30% of the award would vest.

The performance condition for the 2011 were satisfied over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options vested unless the Companys grant is also directly linked to the Groups Operating Profit.
If Operating Profit is in excess of 100m, share price achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
At that point one third of 1% of the award will vest for every additional 1m of Operating Profit achieved, up to a maximum of this portion of the options vested.

These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index.
The respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table on page 94.
For the 2010 share option grant for Executive Directors only, the vesting of awards will be subject to profit before tax performance conditions measured over a three year period.
Vesting will occur on a phased basis, with 30% of the award vesting for threshold performance, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the award for maximum performance.
Called-up share capital continued Share Option valuation and measurement The options outstanding at 31 December 2011 have an exercise price in the range of 81.5 pence to 492.9 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 7.8 years.
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Plans incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Share price 4.91 3.82 4.91 4.91 Average exercise price 4.91 3.82 Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 1.28 1.17 4.65 4.73 Expected volatility 31% 38% 31% 31% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 2 years Risk free rate 2.84% 2.99% 2.84% 2.84% Expected dividend yield 1.83% 2.10% Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since flotation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 12.7m 2010: 10.0m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 56 and 57, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Reserves Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of proceeds over the nominal value for all share issues, including the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The movement in the capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
Reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust At 31 December 2011, the reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust consisted of 16,739,896 ordinary shares 2010: 18,955,701 ordinary shares held for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, the Annual Bonus Plan and the Share Option Scheme SOS, representing 5.3% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 58.4m 2010: 105.2m.
There are 13,363,693 of these shares held in the trust that are treated as non-dilutive on which dividends are waived.

i credit risk An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
No interest is charged on trade receivables ii liquidity risk from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 150 days because iii market risk historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 150 days are generally This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the not recoverable.
Trade receivables below 150 days are provided for based on estimated Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past management of capital.

by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.

The demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk.
Less than 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversification of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.

The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14.
ii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the Companys shares.
The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.

The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
iii Market risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in Pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown on page 103.
There has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
For additional information on market risk, refer to Treasury management and currency risk in the Business Review.
Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The Groups only interest bearing assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011 relate to cash and bank overdrafts.
The average interest rate paid on bank overdrafts was 1.91% 2010: 1.82%.
101 FiNANCiAl STATeMeNTS 22. financial risk management continued Currency rate risk The Group publishes its results in Pounds Sterling and conduct its business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, the Group is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange swap derivative financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Derivatives are disclosed within cash on the face of the balance sheet.
Contract amounts Derivatives at fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives Financial instruments m m m m 49.1 49.1 Derivative Assets 30.8 31.1 Derivative Liabilities 49.1 30.8 49.8 30.9 Net Derivative Liabilities Assets 0.7 0.2 Sensitivity analysis currency risk A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown on page 103.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table right, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
