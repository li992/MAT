Impairment testing of xed asset investments As a result of the Groups ongoing disposal of non-core operations during the year, the Companys investment in Anglo American Finance UK plc AA Finance was tested for impairment at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
The carrying value of the Companys investment in AA Finance is supported by a number of businesses, including the Tarmac group.
In 2010, consistent with the Groups loss on disposal of certain Tarmac European businesses during the year, the Company recognised an impairment charge of $320 million.
A value in use model, using a discount rate of 6%, was utilised to determine the recoverable amount of the investment.
d Accounting policies: Anglo American plc, the Company The Anglo American plc the Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP and in accordance with UK company law.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis as modied by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Actual results may differ from those estimated.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2011 175 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY continued Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
For those share schemes with market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo model at the grant date.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using a Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the date of grant.
For all share schemes with non-market related vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings.
Equity settled share-based payments that are made to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Companys investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Investments Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Convertible debt Convertible bonds are classied as compound instruments, consisting of a liability and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt and is recognised within borrowings and carried at amortised cost.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company, is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.

The Zandrivierspoort Project is not reported as Anglo Americans shareholding is below the internal threshold for reporting.
Details of this project are presented in the Kumba Iron Ore Annual Report.
1 Kolomela Mine Ore Reserves: The increase is primarily due to production which has been offset by a lowering of the cut-off grade applied during the Life of Mine Plan scheduling to equalise plant feed grade in the initial years which previously exceeded client quality specications.
A revision of the Mineral Resource classication using a quantitative scorecard approach was carried out in 2011 and impacts on the Ore Reserve classication.
The calculated 2011 Mine Life excludes Inferred Resources.
2 Sishen Mine Ore Reserves: The net decrease is due to production as well as a revision of the Life of Mine schedule necessitated by a downgrade of Banded Iron Formation Mineral Resources.
Theimpact of this reduction was offset by blending in lower quality material that in the previous Life of Mine Plan remained on run-of-mine stockpiles after the Mine Life ran out and were considered asmining losses.
Inclusion of this material has been confirmed by economic studies.
3 Thabazimbi Mine Ore Reserves: The decrease is due to a revision of the geological interpretations, geological modelling and subsequent Mineral Resource estimation, the effects of which were carried through to the Ore Reserves, especially in the Kumba mining area.
4 Kolomela Mine Mineral Resources: The net increase is primarily the result of geological model renements undertaken in 2011 to consider a structural re-interpretation conducted for the ore bodies scheduled in the Life of Mine Plan by an external structural geology expert.
3.6 Mt of the Inferred Mineral Resources are extrapolated Inferred Mineral Resources as opposed to the rest being interpolated Inferred Mineral Resources.
5 Sishen Mine Mineral Resources: The significant increase in Mineral Resources can primarily be attributed to a re-allocation of Banded Iron Formation lower grade iron ore Jig beneficiation feed Mineral Resources to an Inferred status to appropriately reect the uncertainty in grade estimates associated with historical selective high grade sampling practices.
This caused a decrease in the overall average grade above the 40% Fe cut-off.
6 Thabazimbi Mine Mineral Resources: The primary contributing factor to the increase in Mineral Resources was a significant increase in the long term forward looking iron ore price, which is converted to a revenue factor to derive an optimistic pit shell which spatially defines eventual economic extraction for the Kumba Iron Ore Group.
This had the effect of converting Mineral Inventory into Mineral Resources, especially at the Kumba mining area.
The increase was offset by the revised geological model which resulted in Mineral Resource write-offs, particularly at the Kumba mining area as well as Mineral Resource classication downgrading to consider the fact that Thabazimbi Mine mainly relies on percussion drilling to define Mineral Resources as compared to other Kumba operations which use a combination of percussion and core drilling, with the latter a large portion of the data used for Mineral Resource grade estimations.
7 Phoenix Project: The Phoenix Project addresses possible or potential beneficiation opportunities for the Hematite ore reported as Vanderbijl Pit Hematite in 2010 for the ring-fenced Vanderbijl mining area in combination with other low grade material in the same area not reported in 2010.
The total Hematite Mineral Resource for this project has been reclassied as Inferred, primarily due to the low confidence associated with the historical information currently considered in the project resource denition.
Assumption with respect to Mineral Tenure Sishen Mine: On 21 December 2011 judgment was delivered in the North Gauteng High Court regarding the status of the Mining Rights at the Sishen Mine.
The High Court held that, upon the conversion of Sishen Iron Ore Companys SIOC Old Order Mining Right relating to the Sishen Mine properties in 2008, SIOC became the exclusive holder of a converted Mining Right for iron ore and quartzite in respect of the Sishen Mine properties.
Accordingly, Kumba Iron Ore Group attributable percentage in SIOC increased to 73.9% in 2011.
As a consequence, the Anglo American plc attributable percentage in Sishen Mine increases to 48.2%.
On 3 February 2012 both the South African Department of Mineral Resources, aswell as Imperial Crown Trading 289 Pty Ltd, submitted applications seeking leave to appeal against the High Court order.
180 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2011 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES IRON ORE estimates as at 31 December 2011 IRON ORE BRAZIL The Minas Rio project is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and will include open pit mines and a beneficiation plant producing high grade pellet feed which will be transported, through a slurry pipeline, over 500km to the Port of Au in the state of Rio fide Janeiro.
The project will largely be based on the two main deposits of Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga.
Two ore types, Friable and Compact Itabirite, have been identied at Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga.
Only the friable material is being considered for Phase 1 of the project.
The planned annual capacity of Phase 1 is 26.5 Mtpa of iron ore pellet feed wet tonnes, for start up during in the second half of 2013.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources.

1 Amap Mineral Resources: The cut-off grade used is 25% Fe.
Tonnages are reported on a wet basis with an average moisture content of 11.3 wt% for Canga, 10.5 wt% for Colluvium and 9.9 wt% for Friable Itabirite and Hematite ore.
Mineral Resources increase due to new in-ll drilling information and the inclusion of the Drago area.
The classication methodology was also rened during 2011.
Additional metallurgical studies will be completed to assess the viability of processing Hydrothermally Altered Itabirite ZAH and Magnetite-bearing carbonated rock RCB.
