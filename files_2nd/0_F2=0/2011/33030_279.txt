3 Disposals and non-current assets held for sale As part of the response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the group plans to deliver up to $38 billion of disposal proceeds by the end of 2013.
In 2011, disposal proceeds, including deposits received or repaid, amounted to $2.7 billion, after repayment of the $3.5 billion deposit following the termination of the agreement to sell our interest in Pan American Energy LLC PAE.
On 5 November 2011, BP received from Bridas Corporation Bridas a notice of termination of the share purchase agreement for their purchase of BPs 60% interest in PAE.
As a result of Bridass decision and action, the share purchase agreement governing this transaction, originally agreed on 28 November 2010, was terminated.
BPs interest in PAE had been classified as held for sale in the group balance sheet from the date the sale was originally agreed in 2010, and equity accounting for PAE ceased from that date.
However, following the termination of the sale agreement, our interest in PAE no longer meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale under IFRS.
Consequently, equity accounting has been reinstated and BPs investment in PAE at 31 December 2010 of $2,641 million has been reclassified in the group balance sheet from assets classified as held for sale to investments in jointly controlled entities.
The major disposal transactions completed in 2011 were the sale of our interests in Columbia to Ecopetrol and Talisman, the sale of our upstream and midstream assets in Vietnam and our investments in equity-accounted entities in Venezuela to TNK-BP, and the sale of our assets in Pakistan to United Energy Group.
We also completed the disposal of half of the 3.29% interest in the  development in Azerbaijan to SOCAR and a number of interests in the Gulf of Mexico to Marubeni Group.
As a result of the groups disposal programme following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, various assets, and associated liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the group balance sheet at 31 December 2011.
The carrying amount of assets held for sale is $8,420 million, with associated liabilities of $538 million.
On 1 December 2011, BP announced that it had agreed to sell its Canadian natural gas liquids NGL business to Plains Midstream Canada ULC who will pay BP a total of $1.67 billion in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments.
Completion of the transaction is subject to closing conditions including the receipt of all necessary governmental and regulatory approvals.
In addition, BP intends to divest the Texas City refinery and related assets, and the southern part of its US West Coast fuels value chain, including the Carson refinery.
BP intends to complete the sales in 2012.
4 Dividends The quarterly dividend expected to be paid on 30 March 2012 is 8 cents per ordinary share $0.48 per ADS.
The corresponding amount in sterling will be announced on 19 March 2012.
A scrip dividend alternative is available, allowing shareholders to elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares and ADS holders in the form of new ADSs.
Details of the Scrip Dividend Programme are available at bp.
5 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes treasury shares and the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts ESOPs and includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share plans.
For the diluted EpS calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease the loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
