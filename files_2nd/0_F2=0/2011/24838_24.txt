Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise certain securities held with the Companys wholly owned subsidiary.
These financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss since the Company manages these as a portfolio of assets and takes investment decisions based on their fair values.
After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement.
Fair values are determined by discounting the expected future principal, interest and dividend cash flows associated with these assets at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
The rate applied at 31 March 2011 was the weighted average rate used in determining the fair value of the Groups investments.
Interest income Interest income arising on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the origination date.
The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
Financial risk management The relevant risks to the Company are managed as described in Note 4 to the consolidated accounts.
