Additional information Below is a summary of revenue and gross margin by market channels.
Gross margin includes revenue and those costs directly attributable to specific revenue streams or customers.
The gross margin does not include the costs of running and maintaining the network, including depreciation, which is the primary asset used across all market channels.
Investment in the Groups network is not considered by the CODM based upon market channel or product.
Further, the management, legal and operating structure of the Group isnot organised around these market channels.
These analyses are not used by the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group Board to allocate resources across the Group as a large proportion of the expenses of the Group are not customer specific.
Accordingly, the Directors believe these market channels are not operating segments for the purposes of IFRS 8.
