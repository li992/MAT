Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued III.
Impairment of other intangible assets with definite lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with a definite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of brand names is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
The recoverable amount of brand licences is based on an estimation of future sales and other specific cash flows, the contracted royalty rate and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Note 13 provides further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with definite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.
Impairment of other intangible assets with infinite lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with an infinite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of these assets is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Note 13 provides further detail of the judgements made by the Board in determining that the lives of acquired fascia names are infinite and further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with infinite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.
V. Provisions to write inventories down to net realisable value The Group makes provisions for obsolescence, mark downs and shrinkage based on historical experiences and management estimates of future events.
Onerous property lease provisions The Group makes a provision for onerous property leases on specific stores based on the anticipated future cash outflows relating to the contractual lease cost less potential sublease income.
The estimation of sublease income is based on historical experience and knowledge of the retail property market in the area around each specific property.
Significant assumptions and judgements are used in making these estimates and changes in assumptions and future events could cause the value of these provisions to change.
This would include sublet premises becoming vacant, the liquidation of an assignee resulting in a property reverting to the Group or closing an uneconomic store and subletting at below contracted rent.
Onerous contract provisions The Group makes a provision for specific onerous contracts where there is a shortfall between the anticipated revenues and costs pertaining to those contracts.
Significant assumptions and judgements are used in making these estimates, and changes in assumptions and future events could cause the value of these provisions to change.
Value of put options held by non-controlling interests The Group recognises put options over non-controlling interests in its subsidiary undertakings as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put option.
The present value of the non-controlling interests put options are estimated based on expected earnings in Board-approved forecasts and the choice of a suitable discount rate see note 25.
Estimation of useful economic lives of brand names The Group amortises brand names over their useful economic life.
In determining the useful economic life of each brand name, the Board considers the market position of the brands acquired, the nature of the market that the brands operate in, typical product life cycles of brands and the useful economic lives of similar assets that are used in comparable ways.
Determination of fair value of assets and liabilities on acquisition For each acquisition, the Group reviews the appropriateness of the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired, taking into account the application of Group accounting policies, to determine if fair value adjustments are required.
The key judgements involved are the identification and valuation of intangible assets which require the estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
Segmental analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Executive Chairman of JD Sports Fashion Plc.
Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker is focused on the nature of the businesses within the Group.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Sport retail - includes the results of the sport retail trading companies JD Sports Fashion Plc, John David Sports Fashion Ireland Limited, Chausport SA and Duffer of St George Limited Fashion retail - includes the results of the fashion retail trading companies Bank Fashion Limited and RD Scott Limited Distribution businesses - includes the results of the distribution companies Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Canterbury Limited including global subsidiary companies, Kooga Rugby Limited and Nanny State Limited The Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and reviews segmental operating profit.
Certain central administrative costs including Group Directors salaries are included within the Groups core Sport retail result.
This is consistent with the results as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of information regarding revenue from major products and customers.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from the retail of a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories to the general public.
As such, the disclosure of revenues from major products and customers is not appropriate.
Intersegment transactions are undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arms length terms.
The Board consider that certain items are cross divisional in nature and cannot be allocated between the segments on a meaningful basis.
The share of results of joint venture is presented as unallocated in the following tables, as this entity has trading relationships with companies in all of the three segments.
An asset of 3,458,000 2010: 635,000 for the equity accounted investment in joint venture is included within the unallocated segment.
Net funding costs and taxation are treated as unallocated reflecting the nature of the Groups syndicated borrowing facilities and its tax group.
A deferred tax asset of 125,000 2010: liability of 748,000 and an income tax liability of 12,370,000 2010: 10,789,000 are included within the unallocated segment.
Each segment is shown net of intercompany transactions and balances within that segment.
The eliminations remove intercompany transactions and balances between different segments which primarily relate to the net down of long term loans and short term working capital funding provided by JD Sports Fashion Plc within Sport retail to other companies in the Group, and intercompany trading between companies in different segments.
