At 31 December 2011, the Company had 119,435 registered holders of 1,292,355,052 Ordinary Shares.
At 31 December 2011, there were approximately 209,000 holders of ADRs representing 8.6% of the issued share capital of the Company and 136,000 holders of Ordinary Shares held under the Euroclear Services Agreement representing 15.3% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The ADRs, each of which is equivalent to one Ordinary Share, are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank JPMorgan.
During 2011, under AstraZenecas share repurchase programme, which was introduced in 1999, 127.4 million Ordinary Shares were repurchased and subsequently cancelled at a total cost of $6,015 million, representing 9.9% of the total issued share capital of the Company at 31 December 2011.
The average price paid per share in 2011 was 2932 pence.
This brings the total number of Ordinary Shares repurchased to date since the beginning of the repurchase programme in 1999, to 557.4 million Ordinary Shares at an average price of 2767 pence per Ordinary Share for a consideration, including expenses, of $26,717 million.
The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged against the profit and loss account reserve.
Ordinary Shares issued in respect of share schemes totalled 10.7 million.
In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Companys share capital was redenominated in US dollars.
On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.
This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985.
Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result of the share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date.
This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par.
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the option of the Company on the giving of seven days written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date, 21 May 1999.
The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astras shares and the remaining 0.4% was acquired in 2000, for cash.
Since April 1999, following the merger of Astra and Zeneca, the principal markets for trading in the shares of the Company are the London Stock Exchange LSE, the Stockholm Stock Exchange SSE and the New York Stock Exchange NYSE.

Taxation for US residents The following summary of material UK and US federal income tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held as capital assets by the US resident holders described below is based on current UK and US federal income tax law, including the US UK double taxation convention relating to income and capital gains, which entered into force on 31 March 2003 the Convention.
This summary does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the US resident holders particular circumstances and tax consequences applicable to US resident holders subject to special rules such as certain financial institutions, entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, persons whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is not the US dollar, tax-exempt entities, or persons holding Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the United States.
US resident holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the UK and US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in their particular circumstances.
This summary is based in part on representations of JPMorgan as depositary for ADRs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement among the Company, JPMorgan and the holders from time to time of ADRs and any related agreements will be performed in accordance with its terms.
The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depository shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary pre-release, or intermediaries in the chain of ownership between holders and the issuer of the security underlying the American depository shares, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US holders of American depository shares, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes.
Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rates, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders.
Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rates for dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.
For purposes of this summary, the term US resident holder means a beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, for US federal income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the US, any state in the US or the District of Columbia, or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source.
This summary assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as discussed below.
UK and US income taxation of dividends The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK company, such as the Company.
For US federal income tax purposes, distributions paid by the Company to a US resident holder are included in gross income as foreign source ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits, calculated in accordance with US federal income tax principles.
Because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earning and profits under US federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to US resident holders as dividends.
The amount of the dividend will be the US dollar amount received by the depositary for US resident holders of ADRs or, in the case of Ordinary Shares, the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pound sterling US dollar rate on the date the dividend is received by the US resident holders, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into US dollars, and it will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to US corporations.
If the dividend is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, US resident holders of Ordinary Shares generally should not be required to recognise foreign currency gains or losses in respect of the dividend income.
They may have foreign currency gain or loss if the amount of such dividend is not converted into US dollars on the date of its receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion above regarding concerns expressed by the US Treasury, dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2013 may be taxable at favourable US federal income tax rates, up to a maximum rate of 15%.
US resident holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules which may limit their ability to be taxed at this favourable rate.
Taxation on capital gains Under present UK law, individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident in the UK, will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are held in connection with a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency or other permanent establishment.
A US resident holder will generally recognise US source capital gains or losses for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar amount realised and such holders US dollar adjusted tax basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
US resident holders should consult their own tax advisers about the treatment of capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for non-corporate US resident holders and capital losses, the deductibility of which may be limited.
Passive Foreign Investment Company PFIC rules We believe that we were not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for the year ended 31 December 2011.
However, since PFIC status depends on the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets including, among others, less than 25% owned equity investments from time to time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year.
If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which Ordinary Shares or ADRs were held, certain adverse tax consequences could apply to US resident holders.
206 Shareholder Information AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Additional Information Information reporting and backup withholding Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless i the US resident holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or ii in the case of backup withholding, the US resident holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.
The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US resident holder will be allowed as a credit against the holders US federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is supplied to the IRS on time.
Certain US resident holders who are individuals, or are controlled by individuals, may be required to report information relating to securities issued by non-US persons, generally on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions including an exception for securities held through US financial institutions.
US resident holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
UK inheritance tax Under the current Double Taxation Estates Convention the Estate Tax Convention between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or ADRs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK, will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individuals death or on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs during the individuals lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK.
Where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US domiciled shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, was a UK national, or the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK.
In the exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of creditrelief.
UK stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty A 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax is payable upon the deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection with the creation of, but not subsequent dealing in, ADRs.
A 0.5% stamp duty is payable on all purchases of Ordinary Shares.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
There are no limitations under English law or the Articles on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders of, or to exercise voting rights in relation to, Ordinary Shares or ADRs or to be registered holders of notes or debentures of Zeneca Wilmington Inc. or theCompany.
