Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 1 Segmental information For management purposes, the group is organised into three operating divisions Environmental Technologies, Precious Metal Products and Fine Chemicals and each division is represented by a director on the Board of Directors.
These operating divisions represent the groups segments.
Their principal activities are described on pages 19 to 31.
The performance of the divisions is assessed by the Board of Directors on underlying operating profit, which is before amortisation of acquired intangibles, major impairment and restructuring charges and profit or loss on disposal of businesses.
Each division is also now assessed on sales excluding precious metals including inter-segment sales as this is believed to be a better measure of each divisions performance than external sales excluding precious metals and so the segmental information has been expanded to include this.
Sales between segments are made at market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.

The revenue is reported in Precious Metal Products as it is generated by the groups platinum marketing and distribution activities and so has a very low return on sales.
Johnson Matthey 87 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 ACCOUNTS Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 1 Segmental information continued The groups country of domicile is the UK.
Revenue from external customers is based on the customers location.
Non-current assets are based on the location of the assets and excludes financial assets, deferred tax assets and post-employment benefits net assets.
On 19th November 2010 the Office of Fair Trading announced that it proposed to refer the sale of Vertec to Dorf Ketal Chemicals AG to the UK Competition Commission for further review.
As a result, the group terminated its agreement with Dorf Ketal and commenced a structured closure of the groups Haverton manufacturing site in Billingham, UK, which was complete by 31st March 2011.
The closure of the site gives rise to a pre-tax impairment and restructuring charge of 14.8 million.
This is excluded from underlying operating profit.
On 31st January 2011 the group announced it was starting consultation with the Works Council about the closure of its autocatalyst facility in Brussels.
The closure of the site is expected to be completed during the year ending 31st March 2012 and gives rise to a pre-tax impairment and restructuring charge which is estimated to be 57.0 million.
During the year ended 31st March 2010 the carrying amount of the groups Fine Chemicals facility in Massachusetts, USA was impaired as a result of the global recession.
This gave rise to a pre-tax impairment loss of 11.3 million in that year, which was excluded from underlying operating profit.
4 Amortisation of acquired intangibles The amortisation of intangible assets which arise on the acquisition of businesses, together with any subsequent impairment of these intangible assets, is shown separately on the face of the income statement.
It is excluded from underlying operating profit.

92 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 13 Share-based payments Share options Equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and were subject to performance targets over a three year period and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and from 2001 to 2006 approximately 800 employees were granted options each year.
In 2007 a new long term incentive plan was introduced and allocations of shares under this plan replaced the granting of share options.
No share options have been granted since the year ended 31st March 2007.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 were subject to a minimum three year performance target of underlying earnings per share EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets were EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets were not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options would lapse.
The targets for options granted in 2004, 2005 and the 3% and 4% targets for options granted in 2006 have been met and so these options are exercisable.
The 5% target for options granted in 2006 was not met and so these options have lapsed.
Gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Options granted in 2001 to 2003 can only be exercised if the normalised EPS has grown by at least UK RPI plus 4% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the options.
They were subject to annual retesting until they lapse on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Since the targets have been met all these options are exercisable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 900 of the groups executive directors, senior managers and middle managers based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2011, shares allocated in 2008, 2009 and 2010 at 31st March 2010, shares allocated in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For the maximum release of 100% of the allocation, EPS must have grown by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
For the shares allocated in 2009 only, the performance conditions have been relaxed and so the minimum release requires EPS growth of 3% compound per annum and the maximum release requires EPS growth of 10% compound per annum.
The performance target relating to shares allocated in 2007 was not achieved and therefore this allocation expired during the year.
Share Incentive Plan SIP UK and Overseas Under the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of basic pay each month, subject to a 125 per month limit.
The SIP trustees buy shares partnership shares at market value each month with the employees contributions.
For each partnership share purchased, the group purchases two shares matching shares which are allocated to the employee.
In the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years from the date of allocation, the linked matching shares are forfeited.
In the Overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time.
401k approved savings investment plans 401k plans In the US there are two 401k plans, one for salaried employees and one for hourly employees.
Salaried employees may contribute up to 50% of their base pay and hourly employees up to 20% of their base pay, both subject to a statutory limit.
Salaried employees choosing Johnson Matthey Plc shares matching are matched 100% of the first 4% contributed and hourly employees are matched 50% of the first 2% contributed.
Employees may contribute after one month of service and are eligible for matching after one year of service.
Further details of the directors remuneration under share-based payment plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 74.

They are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
The total expense recognised during the year in respect of equity settled share-based payments, taking into account expected lapses due to leavers and the probability that EPS performance conditions will not be met, was 17.1 million 2010 10.4 million.
14 Post-employment benefits 14a Group The group operates a number of post-employment benefits plans around the world, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 6.0 million 2010 2.9 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The UK pension plan is a career average salary plan with a final salary section which was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010.
The US hourly pension plan is a fixed benefit plan based upon years of service.
The US salaried pension plan is a final salary plan.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2009 for the UK pension plan and 30th June 2010 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2011 by qualified independent actuaries.

The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the groups largest plan, which is in the UK, at its last full actuarial valuation were PMA92C2009 for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C2009 for female members retiring in normal health.
Allowance for future mortality improvements was made in line with the medium cohort versions of these tables with an underpin of 1% p. a.
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.
These tables have been carried through into the balance sheet calculations at 31st March 2010 and 2011 and the income statement for the year ended 31st March 2011, allowing for the expected improvements over the intervening years.

Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2011 2010 2011 2010 million million million million Environmental Technologies Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 89.2 90.4 Process Technologies 250.2 231.6 110.5 110.5 Precious Metal Products Catalysts and Chemicals 24.9 25.6 Other 5.8 5.8 Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 20.7 21.7 Research Chemicals 21.6 21.6 529.5 513.8 110.5 110.5 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period except as discussed below.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
For the Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU four 2010 five year plans have been approved by management.
Over the next decade management expects the markets for heavy duty diesel catalysts and stationary emissions catalysts will grow significantly, based on emission control legislation already in place or anticipated, as described on page 24 of the Business Review.
Therefore the cash flow projections have been extrapolated using a long term average growth rate of 20% for years 5 to 10 2010 20% for years 6 to 10 and 3% 2010 3% after that.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 30% over the carrying value of the CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2010 5% and the discount rate was 10.1% 2010 10.9%.
The impairment test results in headroom of more than 100% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Johnson Matthey 105 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 ACCOUNTS Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 16 Goodwill continued For Catalysts and Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2010 4% and the discount rate was 10.1% 2010 10.9%.
The long term average growth rate has increased as the long term prospects have improved.
For Macfarlan Smith the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2010 2.5% and the discount rate was 7.6% 2010 9.0%.
The impairment test results in headroom of over 90% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Pharmaceutical Materials and Services the long term average growth rate used was 4% 2010 4% and the discount rate was 7.4% 2010 10.9%.
The resulting headroom exceeds the carrying value of the net assets by more than 400% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2010 5% and the discount rate was 8.3% 2010 9.9%.
The impairment test results in headroom of nearly 300% and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The carrying amount of acquired research and technology includes 23.9 million 2010 21.6 million which is not yet being amortised as the assets are not yet available for use.
These assets are tested for impairment annually.
The impairment losses for computer software of 0.4 million 2010 0.6 million have been included in major impairment and restructuring charges note 3.
The impairment losses for acquired research and technology of 0.9 million 2010 nil have been included in amortisation of acquired intangibles note 4.

An agreement between the partners of AGR Matthey to dissolve the partnership became effective on 29th March 2010.
As part of this dissolution the group acquired a metal products business and a 20% ownership of a plot of land from AGR Matthey.
This dissolution resulted in a charge of 4.4 million in the year ended 31st March 2010, which was excluded from underlying profit before tax.
The group received 3.5 million during the year ended 31st March 2011 which related to residual current assets and liabilities left in the partnership whilst they were converted into cash and so has recognised a gain of 0.1 million.
This gain is excluded from underlying profit before tax.
The AGR Matthey partnership dissolution was completed on 14th September 2010.

28 Financial risk management The groups and parent companys activities expose them to a variety of financial risks including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any speculative trading activity in financial instruments.
28a Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swap as a cash flow hedge as it hedges the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bond attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
The cross currency swaps cash flows are expected to occur in 2015 when the bond which it hedges matures.
The interest element of the cash flow hedge is realised in the income statement each year and the exchange effect is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2015.
At 31st March 2011, 54% 2010 65% of the groups net debt and 44% 2010 57% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 5.06% 2010 5.14%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 3.0 million 2010 1.7 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
28b Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with a significant amount of its profit earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs.
To a lesser extent the group has also financed a portion of its investment in China, Japan and South Africa using currency borrowings and swaps.
The group has designated the currency swap and two euro loans fair value of the loans was 205.1 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations 2010 currency swaps and one euro loan fair value of the loan was 120.3 million as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.

These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2012.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 7.8 cent 2010 8.0 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 4.6 million 2010 2.9 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 5.9 cent 2010 5.6 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 3.0 million 2010 0.9 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 8.0 cent 2010 7.6 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 4.4 million 2010 6.6 million impact on operating profit and a 23.9 million 2010 16.1 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 5.7 cent 2010 5.6 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 4.6 million 2010 6.8 million impact on operating profit and a 27.2 million 2010 21.2 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact on operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 3.2 million 2010 4.6 million for the US dollar and 5.7 million 2010 4.6 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
28c Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.

Johnson Matthey 113 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 ACCOUNTS Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 28 Financial risk management continued 28d Credit risk Within certain businesses, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2011 trade receivables for the group amounted to 764.2 million 2010 542.7 million parent company 214.1 million 2010 181.3 million.
516.0 million 2010 352.8 million of these receivables at group level 128.2 million 2010 130.0 million at parent company level arose in Emission Control Technologies ECT which is part of Environmental Technologies Division and mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
As at 31st March 2011 and at 31st March 2010 for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the groups revenue.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and are closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2011 2010 2011 2010 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 680.0 476.5 195.4 165.2 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 65.9 47.7 14.6 13.6 30 90 days 12.8 13.6 4.1 3.2 more than 90 days 5.5 5.3 0.3 0.4 Total past due but not impaired 84.2 66.6 19.0 17.2 Amounts impaired 7.2 7.1 1.5 1.7 Specific allowances for bad and doubtful debts 6.5 5.5 1.3 0.9 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 0.7 1.6 0.2 0.8 General allowances for bad and doubtful debts 0.7 2.0 0.5 1.9 Trade receivables net of allowances 764.2 542.7 214.1 181.3 Movements in the allowances for impairments were: Group Parent company 2011 2010 2011 2010 million million million million At beginning of year 7.5 11.0 2.8 3.4 Charge for year 3.9 3.4 1.3 0.9 Acquisitions 0.1 Release 3.1 3.0 2.2 0.5 Utilised 1.1 3.5 0.1 1.0 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.4 At end of year 7.2 7.5 1.8 2.8 Financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with high credit ratings.
The exposure to individual banks is monitored frequently against internally defined limits together with the banks credit ratings and credit default swap prices.
As at 31st March 2011, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 15.9 million 2010 27.0 million for the group and 10.7 million 2010 15.2 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single bank was 11.9 million 2010 9.9 million for the group and parent company.
The group and parent company also use money market funds to invest surplus cash thereby further diversifying credit risk and at 31st March 2011 the groups and parent companys exposure to these funds was nil 2010 40.0 million.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2011 was 31.1 million 2010 16.2 million.
114 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 28 Financial risk management continued 28e Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is approximately equal to book value except for: 2011 2010 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Group million million million million US Dollar Bonds 2013, 2015 and 2016 302.4 304.2 315.0 316.7 US Dollar EIB loan 2011 65.9 67.8 Euro Bonds 2021 88.4 89.7 Euro EIB loan 2013 110.7 115.4 111.6 120.3 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 42.0 40.0 42.5 2011 2010 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value Parent company million million million million Amounts receivable from subsidiaries 1,079.7 1,084.1 897.9 895.0 US Dollar Bonds 2013, 2015 and 2016 302.4 304.2 315.0 316.7 US Dollar EIB loan 2011 65.9 67.8 Euro Bonds 2021 88.4 89.7 Euro EIB loan 2013 110.7 115.4 111.6 120.3 Sterling Bonds 2013 40.0 42.0 40.0 42.5 The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
It is not possible to determine reliably the fair value of the groups unquoted available-for-sale investments which have a book value of 8.0 million 2010 7.5 million as there is no active market.
These are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in an investment vehicle that invests in start up companies and so there is a wide range of possible values.
Given their size it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
28f Capital management The groups policy for managing capital is to maintain an efficient balance sheet to ensure that the group always has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future growth.
The group has a long term target of a return on invested capital underlying operating profit divided by average capital employed of over 20% to ensure focus on efficient use of the groups capital.
See the section on return on invested capital in the Financial Review on page 35 for more information.
The group also has a long term target of net debt including post tax pension deficits to EBITDA of between 1.5 and 2.0 times although in any given year it may fall outside this range depending on future plans.
See the section on capital structure in the Financial Review on page 36 for more information.

These leases are from banks for specified periods typically a few months and for which the group pays a fee.
These arrangements are classified as operating leases.

39 Acquisitions If all the acquisitions in the year had been completed on 1st April 2010 the revenue for the group would have been 10,006.4 million and its profit for the year 182.1 million.
The total purchase consideration was 52.0 million and the total intangible assets acquired were 33.9 million, property, plant and equipment 20.4 million, inventories 12.2 million, receivables 5.4 million, payables 10.6 million, current tax liabilities 1.4 million and deferred tax liabilities 8.2 million.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.8 million incurred on the acquisitions completed in the year ended 31st March 2011 were charged to administrative expenses in the year.
X-Zyme Biotechnology GmbH On 2nd July 2010 the group acquired 100% of X-Zyme Biotechnology GmbH, a biocatalysis company.
The cash consideration was 1.0 million with a further 0.2 million contingent on future sales over a three year period.
The fair value of the assets acquired was 0.6 million, consisting of 0.7 million for intangible assets, 0.1 million for property, plant and equipment and 0.2 million deferred income tax liabilities.

42 Key sources of estimation uncertainty Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
The group and parent company have made appropriate estimates when applying the accounting policies, but the actual outcome may differ from those calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-employment benefits The groups and parent companys defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified independent actuaries.
The details of the plans and assumptions used are described in note 14.
Goodwill The group has capitalised goodwill of 529.5 million and the parent company has 110.5 million.
Annual impairment reviews are performed which require various assumptions.
More details are given in note 16.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets which are not yet being amortised are also subject to annual impairment reviews based on discounted cash flow projections.
More details are given in note 17.
Provisions and contingent liabilities As described in note 29 and the accounting policies, the group and parent company measure provisions and contingent liabilities at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date.
Johnson Matthey 123 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 ACCOUNTS Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2011 42 Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine the tax charge included in the accounts.
If the tax eventually payable or reclaimable differs from the amounts originally estimated then the difference will be charged or credited in the accounts for the year in which it is determined.
Refining process and stock takes The groups and parent companys refining and fabrication businesses process significant quantities of precious metal and, similar to many industrial activities, losses may arise during processing.
The extent of such losses depends on many factors, including the nature of material being refined, the specific refining processes applied and processes efficiency.
Judgment is therefore required in estimating the amount of such losses when setting process loss provisions.
In addition stock takes, particularly at the refining businesses, involve estimation of volumes in the refining system and the subsequent assaying of material to assess the precious metal content.
In addition, the results of assaying and therefore the stock take itself are only available some time after the date of the stock take.
In setting process loss provisions and assessing the stock take results management takes account of past experience, ability to extract precious metals from the refining process and other factors when estimating losses and gains.
