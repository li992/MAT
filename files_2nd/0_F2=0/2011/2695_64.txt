Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let.
The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
This is expected to occur within the next 20 years.
Property provisions released during the year were as a result of the sub-letting of previously vacant properties or lease exits where dilapidations and other exit costs were less than previously provided for.
Additional provisions and amounts reversed were all in respect of exceptional items.
Redundancy In the periods presented, redundancy provisions included the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date.
Amounts provided for during the year were non-exceptional in nature, relating to the cost of redundancies arising in the normal course of business.
The provision is expected to be used within one year.
Amounts reversed were previously set up as exceptional charges and were credited to exceptional items in the year.
Network and asset retirement obligations In the periods presented, provision was made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity.
These provisions are expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites, technical sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling.
This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arose.
Amounts utilised in the periods presented related predominantly to cash expenditure against unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.
Additional provisions and amounts reversed in the year that impacted the income statement were all in respect of exceptional items.
Other Other provisions include the costs of integration of the THUS Group, business transformation initiatives and specific legal claims against the Group.
Additional amounts charged in the year comprised 10 million in respect of exceptional items and 3 million of ordinary operating costs.
Amounts reversed of 6 million were previously set up as non-exceptional charges.
30 Retirement benefits obligations The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.
These schemes include both defined benefit schemes, where retirement benefits are based on employees remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with recommendations from independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Demerger Prior to demerger, a number of the Groups current and former employees participated in the defined benefit portion of the Cable &Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF, operated by the Cable & Wireless Group now Cable & Wireless Communications Group.
Amounts related to the defined benefit net expense or credit in the CWSF prior to the transfer were recharged to the Group by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as Cable&Wireless Worldwide did not have a legal obligation to the CWSF for these amounts.
These amounts have been recorded as though they were defined contribution expenses.
As a result of the demerger see note 4, a portion of the assets and pension obligations of the CWSF were transferred to the Cable &Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CWWRP, a new plan operated by the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group.
The obligations transferred to the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group were determined based on members last known employer.
The plan assets transferred to the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group were determined by reference to the obligations transferred.
Under IAS 19, this resulted in defined benefit plan assets of 1.2 billion and defined benefit pension obligations of 1.3 billion being transferred to the Group on 26 March 2010.
86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 Defined contribution schemes The pension cost for the year for the Group schemes accounted for on a defined contribution basis was 14 million 2009 10: 18 million.
In 2009 10 the total pension cost also included a net expense of 4 million in respect of management charges as a result of membership of the CWSF allocated historically to the Group.
Defined benefit schemes The CWWRP provides defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements for current and former employees of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group.
The CWWRP has been closed to new defined benefit members since its inception in 2010.
No new defined benefit members have entered the CWSF since 1998.
The terms of the CWWRP Trust Deed allow the Trustee or the Company to call for a valuation at any time.
The first funding valuation of the CWWRP, as at 30 September 2010, is in progress.
In the meantime, the Group will make contributions to the CWWRP at the rate of 28.5% of pensionable earnings which applied in the CWSF prior to demerger.
The contribution rate includes an allowance of 3% of pensionable earnings for administration expenses, excluding the Pension Protection Fund PPF levy.
The Group therefore paid a total contribution rate of 28.5% 2009 10: 28.5% towards the CWWRP in respect of its current and former employees in 2010 11, or 9.1 million 2009 10: 9.4 million.
On demerger an interim funding agreement was reached with the CWWRP Trustee.
As a result, the Group paid 11 million into the CWWRP in October 2010 and a further 25 million in April 2011.
In addition, the Group made a 5 million cash contribution to the CWWRP on 31 March 2010.
A 100 million contingent funding agreement was agreed with the CWWRP Trustee in connection with the demerger, under which the Trustee can call for a letter of credit or cash escrow in certain circumstances, such as material deterioration in the financial performance of the business.
A new funding agreement will be put in place following the finalisation of the 30 September 2010 funding valuation.
Other schemes The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group operates the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme.
An independent actuarial valuation of the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme carried out with an effective date of 31 December 2008 showed a deficit of 2 million on a funding basis.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide made a one-off 1 million contribution on 31 March 2010 in order to fully fund this scheme on a continuing basis.
The Group also operates defined benefit arrangements in Hong Kong and Ireland, unfunded liabilities in the UK relating to pension provision for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap, and other small defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK.
IAS 19 valuation Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CWWRP and other schemes IAS 19 valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated to 31 March 2011 by qualified independent actuaries, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP.
The main financial assumptions applied and an analysis of the schemes assets at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010 are as follows: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Other Other CWWRP schemes CWWRP schemes Assets Assumption Assets Assumption Assets Assumption Assets Assumption m % m % m % m % Inflation assumption RPI 3.4 3.4 3.6 3.2 Inflation assumption CPI 2.7 2.7 n a n a Salary increases 3.9 3.7 4.1 4.1 Pension increases 2.2 3.3 3.2 2.3 3.5 3.4 Discount rate 5.6 5.6 5.5 5.4 Long-term expected rate of return by assettype Annuity policies 323 5.6 332 5.5 Equities 557 8.1 94 7.8 510 8.3 73 7.8 Bonds and gilts 182 4.5 45 5.0 115 5.4 53 5.1 Property 32 6.7 6.7 69 6.8 6.8 Cash and swaps 145 3.6 1 3.7 170 3.9 4 4.0 1,239 140 1,196 130 The assumptions regarding mortality rates in retirement for the CWWRP include allowances for future mortality, improvements in line with medium cohort projections of the 1992 mortality series tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, subject to a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.5%.
These are the mortality rates used for calculating the defined benefit obligation in the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide 2010 11 Annual Report 87 30 Retirement benefits obligations continued Based on these assumptions, the life expectancy of scheme members are as follows: Age 60 Age 60 Age 60 in 2011 in 2021 in 2031 years years years Male 28.1 29.3 30.6 Female 30.6 31.9 33.1 Assumptions used are best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions shown above for Other schemes represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes.
A one year increase in the life expectancy assumptions would have increased the CWWRP liabilities by approximately 27 million as at31March 2011.
The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy is 7million.
A 0.25% pa decrease in the discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities would have increased the liabilities by around 73million.
The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy is 12 million.
A 0.25% pa change in the assumed rate of salary increases would have changed the liabilities by around 4 million.
Excluding the annuities, which are measured at the value of the obligation to which they relate, the overall expected rate of return for each pension scheme is a weighted average of the expected asset return for each asset class.
The expected asset return for each asset class has been set as a best estimate of the long-term return that will be achieved for the particular asset class in the country in question having regard to investment yields on the measurement date.
The CWWRP is closed to new entrants.
Under the projected unit credit method used for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

In addition, the Group may be required to recognise an additional liability to the extent that it is committed to a funding plan which may in the future push the scheme into an irrecoverable surplus.
Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The effect of these adjustments described as asset ceiling adjustments was nil as at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows.

The initial recognition of the CWWRP and unfunded scheme in 2009 10 was recorded as a past service cost of 143 million and treated as an exceptional item see note 6.
The total amount recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the current financial year and cumulatively to 31 March 2011 was a gain of 55 million 2009 10: loss of 20 million and gain of 19 million 2009 10: loss of 36 million respectively.

Inflation measure: CPI v RPI In July 2010 the UK Government announced that the Consumer Prices Index CPI should replace the Retail Prices Index RPI as the statutory minimum inflation measure to be used in determining pension increases, where the scheme rules and historic practice permits, for private sector defined benefit pension schemes.
The Group is in the process of taking legal advice on this matter to determine whether the scheme rules of the CWWRP permit the use of CPI as an indexation measure.
In the case of this particular pension scheme the issue is complex and therefore the matter had not been concluded upon at 31 March 2011.
As a result, the Group continued to use RPI as its best estimate of the appropriate indexation measure.
The use of CPI for certain inflation assumptions for other schemes has resulted in a 4 million reduction of scheme liabilities recognised through other comprehensive income.
