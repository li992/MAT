Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the profit attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.

The companys definition of adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The following items are excluded from adjusted earnings: Other net gains and losses represent profits and losses on the acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets that are included within continuing or discontinued operations but which distort the performance of the Group.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition costs and movements in contingent acquisition consideration are also excluded from adjusted earnings as these items are not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.

Earnings per share continued Other net finance income costs include the finance costs of put options and deferred consideration that relate to future earn outs and similar payments on acquisition, foreign exchange and other gains and losses that represent short-term fluctuations in market value and foreign exchange movements on transactions and balances that are no longer in a hedge relationship.
In the case of acquisition related items these are excluded as they do not reflect cash expended and foreign exchange and other gains and losses are subject to significant volatility and may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold these instruments to maturity.
Other net finance costs of Group companies are included in finance costs or finance income as appropriate.
Other net finance costs of joint ventures and associates are included within the share of results of joint ventures and associates within operating profit.
Tax on the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
Where relevant the Group also excludes the benefit from recognising previously unrecognised pre-acquisition and capital losses.
The Group adds the benefit of tax amortisation of goodwill and intangibles as this benefit more accurately aligns the adjusted tax charge with the expected medium-term rate of cash tax payments.
Non-controlling interest for the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
