ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES MANGANESE estimates as at 31 December 2011 SAMANCOR MANGANESE The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 and The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 as applicable.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources source: BHP Billiton.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 GEMCO Ore Reserves: Production during 2011 has been balanced by the inclusion of additional G Quarry Ore Reserves.
Manganese grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields.
2 Mamatwan Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production depletion and the re-running of the resource model.
A Section 102 application has been approved by the South African Department of Mineral Resources to amend the Mamatwan Mining Rights area to include the Ntsimbintle Prospecting Right.
3 Wessels Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to a revised Upper Body pillar design, redenition of mining areas as per Life of Mine Plan and updating of geological and mining losses.
ASection 102 application has been approved by the South African Department of Mineral Resources to amend the Wessels Mining Rights area to include the Ntsimbintle Prospecting Right.
The Wessels and Ntsimbintle Lower Body Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, which were previously declared separately, are therefore combined and declared as a single Ore Reserve and a single Mineral Resource respectively.
4 GEMCO Mineral Resources: The change is primarily due to the inclusion of additional resource denition drilling data, resulting in the upgrade in confidence of a large proportion of Indicated to Measured Mineral Resources and the inclusion of Inferred Resources from the Eastern Exploration Areas into the Mineral Resource statement.
5 Mamatwan Mineral Resources: A cut-off grade of 35% Mn is used to declare Mineral Resources within the M, C and N Zones at Mamatwan.
Mineral Resources have also been declared from the XZone, using a cut-off of 35% Mn, however, the Top Cut Resources comprising a total of 42.3 Mt are declared above a cut-off of 28% Mn.
6 Wessels Mineral Resources: A new Mineral Resource model was developed during 2010 and this model has resulted in the increase in Mineral Resource after consideration of depletion.
7 Beniomi and Bordeaux: Mn grades are for 0.15mm screen size fraction and should be read together with their respective tonnage yields.
The feasibility phase study for the establishment of a 300ktpa mine in Franceville, Gabon, commenced in July 2010 and the study is expected to be completed in the first quarter of FY2012.
The pre-feasibility phase study for phase 2 to increase the production capacity to 1.8 mtpa is expected to commence in the second quarter of FY2012.
However, the Gabon Mining Concession and Mining Convention remain subject to ongoing negotiation.

For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnage gures apply to each product.
The Saleable tonnage cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnage using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account.
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnage.
Additional footnotes appear at the end of the section.
Metallurgical Coking refers to a high-, mediumor low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry: quality measured as Crucible Swell Number CSN.
Metallurgical Other refers to semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection PCI or other general metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal: quality measured by caloric value CV.
Thermal Export refers to lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation: quality measured by caloric value CV.
Thermal Domestic refers to lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation: quality measured by caloric value CV.
