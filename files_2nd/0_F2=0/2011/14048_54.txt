Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share EPS have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
EPS is shown both before and after amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition note 14 and acquisition-related costs to assist in the understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: Number of shares 2011 2010 Millions Millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 490.5 491.5 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options 8.6 8.4 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 499.1 499.9 Earnings per share Per share Per share Earnings amount Earnings amount 2011 2011 2010 2010 m Pence m Pence Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS being net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 175.1 35.70 156.7 31.88 Add back: Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, net of tax of 4.3m 2010: 3.6m 15.7 3.20 13.8 2.81 Acquisition-related costs, net of tax of 0.5m 2010: nil 3.4 0.69 Adjusted earnings before amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition 194.2 39.59 170.5 34.69 Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS 175.1 35.70 156.7 31.88 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 0.62 0.53 Diluted EPS 175.1 35.08 156.7 31.35 At 31 December 2011 options over nil 2010: nil shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted EPS because their exercise price was above the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, antidilutive.
