Inventories Group 2011 2010 m m Land held for development 2,189.7 2,308.7 Construction work in progress 1,023.2 981.4 Part-exchange properties 78.9 47.6 Other inventories 5.0 4.6 3,296.8 3,342.3 a Nature of inventories The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within twelve months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
b Impairment of inventories At 30 June 2011 the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites.
The impairment review compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying value.
This review resulted in no 2010: nil net exceptional impairment charge for the housebuilding business.
Due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross exceptional impairment charges and reversals of 65.0m 2010: 57.4m.
In addition, due to changes arising from normal trading, such as planning status, there was a net inventory impairment charge of 5.4m 2010: 7.4m included within profit from operations.
There was no 2010: 4.8m net impairment for the commercial developments business, although there were gross impairment charges and reversals of 1.2m 2010: gross impairment of 7.3m and gross reversal of 2.5m due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type.
In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single digit sales price inflation in future periods.
The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single digit build cost inflation in future periods.
Further information regarding these judgements is included within the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty section on page 78.
In the past six months, in general, the Group has not seen an improvement in underlying prices, but has continued to deliver further cost reductions.
If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete, then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments 793.1m 2010: 1,208.1m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c Expensed inventories The value of inventories expensed in 2011 and included in cost of sales was 1,696.7m 2010: 1,735.2m including 11.8m 2010: 13.0m of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of 0.4m 2010: 1.9m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period, but excluding the nil 2010: 4.8m exceptional impairment and 5.4m 2010: 7.4m operating impairment.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2011 totalled 17.2m 2010: 25.2m, being the nil 2010: 4.8m classified as an exceptional impairment, the 5.4m 2010: 7.4m operating impairment and the remaining 11.8m 2010: 13.0m incurred in the normal course of trading.
