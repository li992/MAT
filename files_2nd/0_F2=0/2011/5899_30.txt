The charge for the year and effective tax rate can be reconciled to profit per the income statement as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 m % m % Profit before taxation 69.6 37.2 Taxation at the average UK corporation tax rate of 27.2% 2010: 28.0% 18.9 27 10.4 28 Income not taxable in determining taxable profit 0.9 1 0.2 1 Adjustments in respect of prior years - - 0.7 2 Effect of overseas tax rates 3 2.5 7 2.6 Other temporary differences not previously provided for - 0.3 1.4 3 20.2 29 10.7 29 Taxation recognised directly in equity amounts to a deferred taxation charge of 1.7m 2010: credit of 0.1m with a charge of 2.1m 2010: credit of 0.1m recognised in other comprehensive income and a credit of 0.4m 2010: nil recognised elsewhere in equity.
This comprises a charge of 2.9m 2010: credit of 1.0m in respect of actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit post-retirement schemes, a credit 0.8m 2010: charge of 0.9m in respect of interest rate and currency swaps and a credit of 0.4m 2010: nil in respect of share-based payments.
In the UK, the Finance Act 2011, which was substantively enacted on 19 July 2011, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 27% to 26% from 1 April 2011 and to 25% from 1 April 2012.
This change has been reflected in these financial statements, resulting in a 0.6m charge to equity.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The overall effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 August 2011, would be to reduce deferred tax assets by 0.6m.
