Synergy Health plc 50 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the period ended 3 April 2011 1 General information Synergy Health plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group deliver a range of specialist outsourced services to healthcare providers and other customers concerned with health management.
The Company is registered in the United Kingdom under company registration number 3355631 and its registered office is Ground Floor Stella, Windmill Hill Business Park, Whitehill Way, Swindon, Wilts, SN5 6NX.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the nearest weekend to 31 March each year.
The current accounting period is 53 weeks in length 2010: 52 weeks in length.
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 81 to 89.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of consolidation Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, with items of a similar nature on a line-by-line basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated at their fair value through profit and loss.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executives review, and the financial position of the Group and its cash flows and borrowing requirements are described in the Finance Directors report, both of which are set out in the Business review section of the Annual Report.
The Finance Directors report and note 19 to the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial risks and hedging activities together with its exposure to credit and liquidity risks.
The current global economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over the level of demand for the Groups products, the price of its raw materials for certain business areas, and the carrying value of Group debt denominated in foreign currency.
The Directors have reviewed the Groups medium term forecasts through to June 2012 and beyond, along with reasonable possible changes in trading performance and foreign exchange rates arising from these uncertainties to determine whether the committed banking facilities are sufficient to support the Groups projected liquidity requirements, and whether the forecast earnings are sufficient to meet the covenants associated with the banking facilities.
The Groups committed banking facilities are due for renewal in January 2012 and the Directors have good reasons to believe that they will be renewed.
The Group is in advanced discussions with an identified club of banks in respect of new unsecured five year revolving credit facilities to replace the existing facility.
The main points of the new multi-currency facilities agreement have been agreed and the legal documentation is being finalised.
Business combinations From 28 March 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business combinations revised in accounting for business combinations.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value allocations are reviewed and if necessary adjusted no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Costs relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 51 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are initially capitalised at fair value as at the date of the acquisition, and subsequently stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment if there is indication of impairment.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of the identified intangible assets are as follows: Customer-related intangibles 515 years Trade names 10 years Costs incurred in setting up long term agreements are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate.
Technology licences are amortised from the date that they generate economic benefit and over the period of that benefit.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of services but sometimes goods are also supplied, usually as part of a service offering.
Revenue is recognised once the service has been completed and the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer.
The Group does not participate in activities which need to be accounted for under long term contract accounting rules.
Finance charges and income Interest charges and income are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense by reference to the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Financials Governance Operating and financial review Our strategy Who we are Synergy Health plc 52 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for the details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Government grants Government grants towards staff retraining costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs and before any profit losses on business disposals.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and presented in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 53 2 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of services or goods, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their book value, being cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with the exception of cobalt, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements Period of lease Plant and machinery 320 years Office equipment 35 years Cobalt 15 years Circulating inventory 15 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Cobalt is depreciated over 15 years as follows.
The reducing balance is used for the first eight years.
The residual net book value at the end of year eight is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the remaining seven years of the assets useful life.
Potential decommissioning costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated residual working life of the cobalt on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding provision is recognised in the balance sheet.
Circulating inventory mainly comprises linen textile assets provided to customers on a rental service basis.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Investment property Investment properties are properties land and buildings which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the buildings over 50 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Financials Governance Operating and financial review Our strategy Who we are Synergy Health plc 54 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets which arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a third party, and where there is no intention of trading the financial asset.
The receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are netted off against cash.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Some of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows or against net investment in overseas subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not clearly related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where appropriate.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 3 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model, except for the Long-Term Incentive Plan awards which are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition where a model following similar principles to the Monte Carlo approach is used.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 55 2 Accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Where estimates and associated assumptions are made they are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Key areas of estimate uncertainty are set out below.
In relation to the Groups cobalt provision, costs of future disposal are based on contractual arrangements with third parties and latest disposal cost estimates.
The Group cobalt depreciation policy is based on the actual physical decay of the cobalt 60 isotope.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 13, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Impairment tests have been undertaken with respect to goodwill note 11 using commercial judgement and a number of assumptions and estimates have been made to support their carrying amounts.
In relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, actuarial assumptions are established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external qualified actuaries.
In relation to compensation received from third parties for insurance receipts, it can be uncertain how the amount received relates to specific items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired, lost or given up.
Adoption of new standards: In the current year, the Group has adopted the following new standards and interpretations: IFRS 3 Business combinations revised, IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, and consequential amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations must be applied for the first time by the Group for the period ending 3 April 2011 but are not currently relevant: Amendments to IFRS 2 Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
Amendments to IAS 32 Rights of issue.
Amendments to IAS 39 Embedded derivatives.
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners.
IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are mandatory for the period ending 3 April 2011, have been adopted in the year.
None of these amendments has had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption but have not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments deals with how entities should measure equity instruments issued in a debt for equity swap.
It addresses the accounting for such a transaction by the debtor only.
IAS 24 Related parties effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011 provides an exemption to all government related entities, which is not applicable to the Group, however the revised standard also amends the definition of a related party, which will be applicable.
Management is currently assessing the impact of these standards and interpretations on the financial statements.
These amendments and the new standards are not expected to impact the Group significantly, although additional disclosure may be required.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Financials Governance Operating and financial review Our strategy Who we are Synergy Health plc 56 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Segmental information The Group is organised into three operating segments, and information on these segments is reported to the chief operating decision maker CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
These three operating segments are: the UK and Ireland, Europe and Middle East, and Asia and Africa.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Americas was created as a fourth operating segment, due to the acquisition of BeamOne.
The segments derive their revenues from the same range of products and services being the provision of healthcare services, medical device sterilisation services, and hospital sterilisation services.
The CODM monitors the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit, being operating profit excluding the impact of amortisation on acquired intangibles and non-recurring items.
Segment information about these divisions is presented below: Europe and UK and Ireland Middle East Asia and Africa Total 2011 2011 2011 2011 000 000 000 000 Revenue from external customers 154,916 118,764 13,634 287,314 Segment profit 25,010 20,548 2,708 48,266 Segment depreciation 14,014 16,427 3,358 33,799 Segment assets 260,180 207,485 78,419 546,084 The comparative figures for the previous year are shown below: Europe and UK and Ireland Middle East Asia and Africa Total 2010 2010 2010 2010 000 000 000 000 Revenue from external customers 158,034 117,426 10,961 286,421 Segment profit 23,327 17,769 2,165 43,261 Segment depreciation 12,612 16,560 2,726 31,898 Segment assets 234,491 203,128 69,584 507,203 The table below reconciles the total segment profit above, to the Groups operating profit and profit before tax: 2011 2010 000 000 Total segment profit 48,266 43,261 Unallocated amounts: Corporate expenses 5,222 3,519 Non-recurring costs 3,278 1,903 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 6,265 6,200 Operating profit 40,057 31,639 Net finance costs 3,324 7,108 Profit before tax 36,733 24,531 The table below analyses the Groups revenues from external customers between the three principal product service groups: 2011 2010 000 000 Healthcare solutions 160,380 174,631 Hospital sterilisation services 56,860 50,004 Medical device sterilisation services 70,074 61,786 287,314 286,421 IFRS 8 Operating segments requires the Group to disclose information about the extent of its reliance on its major customers.

The table and accompanying notes provide further details: 000 Costs incurred on the acquisition of businesses 889 Gain net of costs on legal case 4,167 3,278 Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition of businesses have been recognised in the income statement.
These costs relate primarily to the acquisition of GSP in late 2010 and BeamOne, which completed just after the year end.
These acquisitions are disclosed in more detail in notes 24 and 29 respectively.
During the year the Group received a summary court judgment in our favour relating to an insurance claim arising from a fire at our Dunstable facility in early 2007.
The non-recurring gain of 4,167,000 reflects the recognition of insurance proceeds received, less costs associated with the claim and final additional costs of working not previously written down.
In addition to the above, a non-recurring credit of 1,446,000 2010: nil relating to court awarded interest on the Dunstable insurance case has been recognised in finance income.
The total impact of non-recurring items on profit after tax is a credit of 3,153,000.
In the prior year, non-recurring items of 1,903,000 were charged in arriving at operating profit.
The table and accompanying notes provide further details: 000 Partial closure of Harwell sterilisation plant 609 Closure of a UK linen management facility 400 Closure of Dutch treasury operation 252 Other restructuring costs 642 1,903 B6 B$5 BS LQGG Financials Governance Operating and financial review Our strategy Who we are Synergy Health plc 58 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 4 Profit before tax continued The costs associated with closing a UK linen management facility increased on the amounts reported in 2009, due to the deterioration in the UK commercial property market.
The costs included future liabilities under the property lease.
The costs associated with the partial closure of the Harwell medical device sterilisation facility include staff redundancy costs, decommissioning costs, and future liabilities under the property lease.
Both closures are part of a programme of cost rationalisation in the UK business.
Other restructuring costs were incurred to generate ongoing reductions in the operating cost base in order to restore operating margins throughout the Groups businesses.
In the prior year we also recognised a non-recurring tax credit of 3,020,000.
This relates to a tax credit received on a foreign exchange movement on inter-company Sterling borrowings within a Euro-denominated legal entity.
Tax clearances have been received by the Dutch and UK authorities, and we have also received the associated repayment.

Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
This change became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred tax liability which has been included in the figures above.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax per the income statement as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Profit before tax 36,733 24,531 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 28% 2010: 28% 10,285 6,869 Effect of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 866 108 Different tax rates on overseas earnings 1,096 942 Overseas withholding tax 113 Adjustment in respect of prior years 2,090 4,140 Effect of change in UK corporation tax rate 633 Previously unrecognised unused tax losses 602 364 Tax charge for year 7,934 2,372 The adjustment in respect of prior years in 2010 includes a non-recurring tax credit of 3,020,000.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value, of the assets of a CGU, to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year the goodwill for each CGU was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2010: nil impairment charges resulting.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash flows for a period of five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash flows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each CGU the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the markets to which the CGU is dedicated.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management reflecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each CGU the key assumptions are discount rate, long term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis as at 3 April 2011 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 19.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings approximates to their fair value.
Bank loans under the main syndicated facility of 160 million are due for renewal on 15 January 2012 and all fall due for repayment in total on that date.
These loans attract a floating rate of interest although fixing arrangements have been entered into as described in note 19.
Certain Euro-denominated loans outside of the main syndicated facility totalling 6.9 million are secured by mortgages on certain Dutch freehold properties.
The loans attract both floating and fixed rates of interest.
At 3 April 2011 the Group had available 33.5 million of undrawn committed borrowing facility.
In addition the Group had undrawn overdraft and other uncommitted facilities totalling 12.3 million which it expects to renew during the financial year.

B6 B$5 BS LQGG Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 67 19 Financial instruments Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to fluctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 3 April 2011 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to fix the interest charge on 10.3 million of its bank debt.
The swap arrangements cover: Debt covered Millions Fixed rate Expiry 1.50 4.76% 3 May 2011 10.00 2.30% 13 January 2012 Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expense consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in fixing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 85,000 2010: 619,000 in current liabilities and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to fixed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and one year forward rates: Increase decrease Effect on profit after tax and equity in basis points 000 2011 97 97 874 874 2010 87 87 674 674 c Foreign currency risk The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has investment in overseas operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk in respect of its overseas operations.
Whilst the exposure is limited, the Groups principal currency exposure is to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro.
During the 12 months to March 2011 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro strengthened by 4% in comparison to the 12 month average to March 2010.
A 4% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2011 would have resulted in reduced adjusted operating profit of 1.0 million 2010: a 7% weakening, which would have led to an increase of 1.8 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 4% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
The Board considers that the costs of mitigating any exposure to movements in foreign currency earnings from subsidiaries currently would outweigh the benefits.
Where the Group subsidiaries make significant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
During the 12 months to March 2011 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has weakened by 3% in comparison to the 12 months average to March 2010.
A 3% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2011 would have resulted in increased adjusted operating profit of 0.1 million 2010: a 9% weakening, which would have led to a reduction of 0.4 million.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 3% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Financials Governance Operating and financial review Our strategy Who we are Synergy Health plc 68 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 19 Financial instruments continued Currency derivatives: The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds Euro-denominated loans in UK companies totalling 70.4 million 2010: 63.0 million.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 70.4 million of the Groups Euro-denominated net assets of 235.3 million 2010: 194.4 million.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a loss of 2.2 million 2010: gain of 4.8 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer specific credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Given these factors and based on extensive past experience, the Group believes that its financial assets are of good credit quality.
Exposure to credit risk: The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 83,688,000 2010: 49,687,000 being the total trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
This figure is higher than last year as a result of the cash drawn down to fund the acquisition of BeamOne after the period end.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the world.
No single customer or top 10 customer grouping accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables.
The Group has in place an insurance policy to cover the majority of its Healthcare solutions UK export customers.
Credit quality of trade receivables and impairment losses At the balance sheet date, the ageing of trade receivables was: 2011 2010 Gross Gross Group 000 000 Current 33,110 30,339 130 days overdue 7,740 7,032 3160 days overdue 1,290 1,155 6190 days overdue 573 1,034 More than 90 days overdue 287 491 43,000 40,051 Financial assets are reviewed for impairment at the balance sheet date and a full provision for impairment is made against trade receivables that are not considered to be recoverable.
The total provision against trade receivables at the period end was 418,000 2010: 614,000.
No further analysis has been provided for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables from Group companies, other trade receivables and other financial assets as there is limited exposure to credit risk and no provisions for impairment have been recognised.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Details of the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities are given in note 18.
B6 B$5 BS LQGG Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 69 19 Financial instruments continued Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are: i. to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, and ii.
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by a pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk and b ensuring returns on new investment programmes will maintain or increase shareholder returns.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares, if required.

In accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations revised, management have made adjustments to the book value of net assets acquired to arrive at the fair values disclosed above.
The most significant of these are the recognition of intangible assets customer lists and adjustments to the carrying value of provisions for the disposal of cobalt.

Any option granted in excess of that figure is Unapproved.
Exercise of the options is subject to performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee linked to a sustained and significant improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company over a three year period.
Options granted during the year will vest in accordance with an increase in the Companys earnings per share, adjusted for the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and non-recurring items.

The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account TSR as a market-based performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.

27 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group contributes towards a number of defined contribution and stakeholder schemes.
The assets of these schemes are administered by trustees in funds independent from those of the Group.
The total cost charged to income of 2,850,000 2010: 1,390,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes During the year the Group operated four defined benefit pension schemes for the benefit of certain employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and the Netherlands.
A fifth defined benefit pension scheme, for the benefit of certain employees and ex-employees in Germany, was added during the year with the acquisition of GSP.
In addition, the Group participates in a multi-employer scheme in the Netherlands.
Scheme 1 Synergy Health plc Retirement Benefits Scheme The scheme is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The scheme is only open to new employees transferring their employment from NHS Trusts.
The employer expects to contribute 730,000 for the year starting 4 April 2011.
The current arrangements as regards to contribution levels are described in the Schemes Schedule of Contributions dated 24 June 2010.

An updated actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 3 April 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
Scheme 6 Lips Textielservice Our Dutch linen business participates in a multi-employer industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The plan is managed by the industry pension fund and obligations are reinsured.
In the event that there is an under-funding position the trustees of the scheme can take a range of actions including increasing employee contributions and reducing member benefits as well as asking employers to increase their contributions.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets, liabilities, and overall surplus deficit of the plan attributable to the business, because the plan is industry-wide.
However, to the extent that a surplus or deficit in the plan may affect the amount of future contributions, the Company will be required to recognise its share of these obligations.
Under the specific exemptions within IAS 19, the scheme is therefore treated as a defined contribution scheme within the Group financial statements.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme was 2,482,000 2010: 2,235,000.
IAS 19 disclosures The key weighted average assumptions used by the actuary and the Directors for the significant pension schemes were: 2011 2010 % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.4 4.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.2 3.4 Inflation 3.0 3.7 Discount rate for liabilities 5.6 5.6 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.4 6.6 In assessing the Groups post-retirement liabilities the Group monitors mortality assumptions and uses up-to-date mortality tables.
The following mortality tables have been used: PA92: year of birth, long cohort with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum and scaling factor of between 125% and 130%.
Dutch Standard Table 2006 minus two year age range offset.
It has been assumed that the remaining average lifespan of a plan member if they retire at a normal retirement age is on average 22 years.
The mortality assumptions for the schemes are updated regularly.
Allowance is made for expected future increases in life expectancy.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Current service cost less employee contributions 1,020 777 Of the charge for the year, 475,000 2010: 376,000 has been included in cost of sales and 545,000 2010: 401,000 has been included in administrative expenses.
