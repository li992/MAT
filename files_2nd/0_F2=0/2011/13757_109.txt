Financial risk factors continued Interest rate profiles of financial liabilities The following table sets out the contractual repricing included within the underlying borrowings excluding net borrowings-related derivatives exposed to either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates and revises this for the repricing effect of interest rate and cross currency swaps.

Commodity price risk is managed within minimum and maximum guard rails principally through multi-year fixed price contracts with suppliers and, where appropriate, derivative contracts.
The group hedges a proportion of commodity supply and price risk for a period of up to five years.
Where derivative contracts are used the group manages exposures principally through exchange-traded futures, forwards and swaps.
At 31 March 2011 the notional value of commodity derivatives amounted to US$21 million 2010: US$42 million.
No sensitivity analysis has been provided on these outstanding contracts as the impact is considered to be immaterial.
Equity securities price risk The group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the group and classified on the balance sheet as available for sale investments.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Financial instruments The group limits its exposure to financial institutions by setting credit limits on a sliding scale based on their credit ratings and generally only with counterparties with a minimum credit rating of BBBby Standard & Poors and Baa3 from Moodys.
For banks with a lower credit rating, or with no international credit rating, a maximum limit of US$3 million is applied, unless specific approval is obtained from either the chief financial officer or the audit committee of the board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
To reduce credit exposures, the group has ISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
Trade and other receivables There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.
The type of customers range from wholesalers and distributors to smaller retailers.
The group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one counterparty.
The group considers its maximum credit risk to be US$2,984 million 2010: US$2,749 million which is the total of the groups financial assets.
c. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and a mixture of short-term and medium-term bank credit facilities, bank loans, corporate bonds and commercial paper with a range of maturity dates.
In this way, the group ensures that it is not overly reliant on any particular liquidity source or that maturities of borrowings sourced in this way are not overly concentrated.
Subsidiaries have access to local bank credit facilities, but are principally funded by the group.
At 31 March 2011 the group had the following core lines of credit that were available for general corporate purposes and which were maintained by SABMiller plc: US$2,000 million committed syndicated facility maturing in December 2012.
US$600 million committed syndicated facility maturing in May 2011.

Financial risk factors continued In April 2011 the group entered into a five-year US$2,500 million committed syndicated facility, with the option of two one-year extensions.
Thisreplaced the existing facilities, described above, which were both voluntarily cancelled.
Liquidity risk faced by the group is mitigated by having diverse sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
As at 31 March 2011, borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities amounted to US$3,164 million 2010: US$3,579 million.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

The groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the groups only externally imposed capital requirement relates to the groups core lines of credit which include a net debt to EBITDA financial covenant which was complied with throughout the year.
The group monitors its financial capacity and credit ratings by reference to a number of key financial ratios and cash flow metrics including net debt to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover.
These provide a framework within which the groups capital base is managed including dividend policy.
The group is currently rated Baa1 by Moodys Investors Service and BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services, both with a stable outlook.

Financial risk factors continued Fair value estimation The following table presents the groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived fromprices : The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives or infrequently traded listed investments are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data: Specific valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value of the remaining financial instruments.
