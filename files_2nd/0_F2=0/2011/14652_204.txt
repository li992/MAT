spirent communications plc annual report 2011 Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 2.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 47 to 54 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.
Pensions Defined benefit plans The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Companys most significant plan.
There is in addition an unfunded plan.
The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the Plans as at 1 April 2009.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Inflation-RPI 3.0 3.4 Inflation-CPI 2.0 2.5 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.7 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.9 3.2 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.0 2.2 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.0 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.6 5.5 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 5.5 5.8 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 2010 aged 68 will live on average for a further 21.9 years 2010 19.2 years if they are male and for a further 23.8 years 2010 21.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2021 2010 in 2020 at age 65 2010 age 64 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.9 years 2010 23.7 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24.7 years 2010 25.6 years after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum.
This would increase past service liabilities by 2.5 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor.
This would increase past service liabilities by 5.3 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
