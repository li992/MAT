Cable&Wireless Worldwide CGU The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined using the value in use of the continuing operations of Cable&Wireless Worldwide based upon cash flow projections approved by the Board covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond the projected period are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions on which the projected cash flows are based include revenue and EBITDA growth and the level of capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level.
These assumptions have been determined using a combination of extrapolations of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth rates.
A long-term growth rate of 1% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flow projections into perpetuity.
The growth rate has been determined using long-term historical growth rates of the CGU, which has been benchmarked to long-term average growth rates for the industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9.1% has been used to discount projected cash flows of the CGU.
The discount rate reflects the time value of money and is derived from the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The discount rate reflects the latest market assumptions of the risk free rate, equity risk premium and the net cost of debt.
