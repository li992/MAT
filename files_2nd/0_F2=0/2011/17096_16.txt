year ended 3 March 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2011.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4, segment information.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting and preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 4 March 2010, except for the adoption of the following new Standards and Interpretations that are applicable for the year ended 3 March 2011: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments to Group Cash-settled Share-based Payments The amended standard affects the accounting for cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
This amendment supersedes IFRIC 8 and IFRIC 11.
The adoption of this amendment did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised The amended standard introduces changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after becoming effective.
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interest, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages.
These changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period when an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements amended IAS 27 amended requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The change in accounting policy was applied prospectively and had no material impact on earnings per share.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Classification of Rights Issues amendment The amendment to IAS 32 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010 and amended the definition of a financial liability in order to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments in cases where such rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entitys own non-derivative equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments for a fixed amount in currency.
This amendment had no impact on the Group.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Amendments to Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items The amendment clarifies that an entity is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash flow variability of a financial instrument as a hedged item.
This also covers the designation of inflation as a hedged risk or portion in particular situations.
The Group has concluded that the amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, as the Group has not entered into any such hedges.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
This interpretation has had no impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intraGroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
47 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 2 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset as follows: Trading licences have an infinite life Brand assets are amortised over periods of two to 15 years IT software and technology are amortised over periods of three to 10 years The asset in relation to acquired customer relationships is amortised over 10 years The franchise fee and brand name agreements are amortised over periods up to 15 years Amortisation is reported within administrative expenses in the income statement.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the CGUs recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
48 2 Accounting policies continued Impairment continued The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative and distribution line items.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortised.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated having adjusted profit after tax on the same basis.
The term underlying profit is not defined under IFRSs and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
The adjustments made to reported profit in the income statement in order to present an underlying performance measure include: Exceptional items The Group includes in non GAAP performance measures those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group also includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions, profit or loss on sale of business, impairment and exceptional interest and tax.
IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge credit for defined benefit pension schemes.
Underlying profit includes the service costs but excludes the volatile finance cost revenue element of IAS 19.
49 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 2 Accounting policies continued Taxation The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.
Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, in which case translation differences are reported in other comprehensive income.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non sterling functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels, is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverages are sold.
Revenue from franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names is recognised when earned.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised when they are sold.
Under IFRIC 13, a portion of revenue equal to the fair value of the reward points earned under Costa loyalty card transactions is deferred until those points are redeemed.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
50 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
Except for awards subject to market related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
If options are subject to market related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met.
Instead these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
Cash-settled transactions The cost is fair valued at grant date and expensed over the period until the vesting date with a recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are charged or credited to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset.
The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 2 Accounting policies continued Financial Assets continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest risks associated with underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Cash flow hedges hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm commitment and include foreign currency swaps.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The change in fair value of a fair value hedging derivative is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
The change in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, that is attributable to the hedged risk, is recognised in the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
When a fair value hedge item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The main assumptions are outlined below: Judgements and estimates are required in the identification of separable assets and liabilities upon acquisition, particularly in the case of the valuation and identification of intangible assets such as brand, technology and customer databases.
Note 10 provides details of business combinations in the current year.
52 2 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgements and estimates continued An impairment test of tangible and intangible assets is undertaken each year on both an EBITDA multiple approach and a discounted cash flow approach.
Note 15 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Judgement is used in determining the value of provisions carried for onerous contracts.
This is primarily based around assumptions on rent and property related costs for the period the property is vacant and then assumptions over future rental incomes or potential reverse lease premiums paid.
Note 24 provides details of the value of the provision carried.
Defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method.
Note 32 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
Corporation tax is calculated on the basis of income before taxation, taking into account the relevant local tax rates and regulations.
For each operating entity, the current income tax expense is calculated and differences between the accounting and tax base are determined, resulting in deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation.
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses, pension deficits and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.
Detailed amounts of the carrying values of corporation and deferred tax can be found in note 9.
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB not effective for the current year and not early adopted by the Group The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Amendment The amended standard clarifies the definition of a related party to simplify the identification of such relationships and to eliminate inconsistencies in its application.
The Group does not expect any impact on its financial position or performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASBs work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39.
In subsequent phases, the IASB will address classification and measurement of financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition.
The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a comprehensive picture.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amount of a net pension asset.
It permits an entity to treat the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement as an asset.
The adoption of this interpretation will have no effect on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid.
The equity instruments issued are measured at their fair value of the liability extinguished.
Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
3 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 m m Rendering of services 698.6 629.8 Royalties 16.2 12.6 Sale of goods 884.8 792.6 Revenue 1,599.6 1,435.0 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 4 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units Hotels & Restaurants and Costa based upon their different products and services: Hotels & Restaurants provide services in relation to accommodation and food Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee shops No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on operating profit before exceptional items.
Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables below are the costs of running the public company.
The unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances held and controlled by the central treasury function, taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment and central working capital balances.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding business operating segments for the years ended 3 March 2011 and 4 March 2010.

T he 4.6m of VAT refunded had previously been charged on income from gaming machines operated in the restaurants of the Group.
HMRC refunded the amount paid, plus accrued interest of 0.7m, on the basis of a ruling that VAT may not be applicable on certain types of gaming machine income.
HMRC continues to appeal the ruling, but the Group does not consider it probable that an appeal will be successful.
Accordingly no provision for repayment has been made although a contingent liability is disclosed in note 30.
During the year a net loss of 0.4m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment.
Following a strategic review the Bulgarian and Czech businesses acquired as part of the Coffeeheaven acquisition have been disposed of as going concerns.
T he pension curtailment credit arose due to the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2009 note 32.
In 2007 8, the Group sold its interests in David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Fridays.
Following these disposals it was announced that the Restaurant and Hotels divisions would merge and that the shared service teams would be disbanded.
This restructuring included the final costs associated with the aligning of IT with the new structures.
This then completed the income statement impact of the restructuring programme that was announced in 2007 8.
An impairment review of the Costa operating stores in Russia resulted in an impairment of 74.1m Roubles.
This is a joint venture partnership and hence the Group has incurred a joint venture exceptional loss of 0.7m.
The interest arising on late payment of an item claimed in a previous year, which is disputed, is included in exceptional interest charges.
The interest arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in exceptional interest, reflecting the exceptional nature of the provisions created.
Following the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings, the Group has reviewed and resubmitted prior year capital allowance claims.

As a result of the transaction referred to in note 32, a current tax benefit of 10.9m 2009 10: 28.6m has been obtained in the current year.
The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit has been adjusted to reflect this benefit.
Following the enactment of the Finance Act 2009, the Group considers that the receipts of unremitted earnings from overseas entities would be exempt from UK tax and therefore the temporary difference in relation to unremitted earnings is nil.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 0.8m 2010: 0.1m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years In his budget of 22 June 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a decrease in the rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 24%, phased over a period from April 2011 to April 2014.
An additional 1% reduction, with effect from April 2011, was announced in the budget of 23 March 2011.
Further UK tax changes, subject to enactment, are a reduction from 1 April 2012 in the rate of the capital allowances applicable to plant and machinery and to integral features from 20% to 18% and from 10% to 8% respectively.
The Groups financial statements for the year ended 3 March 2011 reflect only those changes which had been enacted by the balance sheet date, namely the reduction from 28% to 27%, which was enacted in the Finance No.
2 Act 2010 and which applies from April 2011.
In accordance with IFRSs, the remaining proposed changes will only be reflected in the financial statements ended on or after the date such changes have been substantively enacted.
The additional 1% reduction in the rate of corporation tax, with effect from April 2011, was enacted on 29 March 2011 by virtue of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
If the change had been enacted before the Groups balance sheet date, the effect would have been to reduce the deferred tax liability by 5.2m.
The effect of the subsequent reduction to 23%, if enacted, will be to reduce the deferred tax liability by a further 12.1m.
The rate change will also impact the amount of the future cash tax payments to be made by the Group.
10 Business combinations On 2 March 2011 Costa Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of Coffee Nation for a total cash consideration of 59.5m.
Coffee Nation operates over 800 customer facing espresso based coffee vending machines.
59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 10 Business combinations continued The fair value of the indentifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses as at the date of acquisition, and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately before the acquisition were: Provisional Book fair value value to Group m m Property, plant and equipment note 14 7.0 6.6 Inventories 1.7 1.6 Trade and other receivables 1.6 1.5 Deferred tax asset 1.1 1.1 Trade and other payables 2.3 2.8 Net assets 9.1 8.0 Intangible assets in relation to the acquired brand name 0.5 Intangible assets in relation to the acquired technology 8.0 Intangible assets in relation to the customer relationships 5.9 Deferred tax liability in relation to the above intangibles 3.9 Goodwill arising on acquisition 41.0 Total consideration 59.5 Cash flow on acquisition: Cash paid 59.5 Total cash outflow 59.5 Fair values are described as provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the year end.
The fair value adjustment to receivables has been made to bring the balance in line with what is deemed recoverable.
Fair value adjustments to the remaining net assets have been made to bring the accounting in line with the Groups policies.
Acquisition related costs amounting to 0.9m are included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement and do not form a part of the above consideration.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Coffee Nation arises as a result of synergies from coupling the acquired technology and customer relationships in Coffee Nation with the Costa brand and the Mocha Italia blend of coffee.
From the date of acquisition, the Company acquired contributed nil revenue and nil profit to the net profit of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit before interest and taxation for the Group would have increased by 1.1m and the revenue would have increased by 24.3m.
Prior year business combinations In 2009 10, two business combinations, the acquisition of Coffeeheaven Limited and 50.1% of Premier Inn India Private Limited, were effected for a total consideration of 42.7m paid in cash.
Cash acquired totalled 3.9m and goodwill of 24.8m was recognised.
There have been no adjustments to the provisional fair values allocated and disclosed in the financial statements of 2009 10.

60 11 Earnings per share continued The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Where the share price at the year end is lower than the option price the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was nil 2010: nil.

Additions during the year comprise 41.0m arising on the acquisition of Coffee Nation.
The 41.0m of goodwill relating to additions in the year has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the Costa CGU with nil being allocated to the Hotels & Restaurants CGU.
Both of these CGUs are also operating segments and represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The brand intangible asset arose with the acquisition of Coffeeheaven in the previous financial year and on the acquisition of Coffee Nation in this financial year.
It is being amortised over a period of two to 15 years.
The customer relationships asset arose with the acquisition of Coffee Nation in this financial year.
It is being amortised over a period of 10 years.
IT software and technology has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to 10 years from the date it became fully operational.
Other intangibles Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and the franchise fee and brand name agreements acquired with the Premier Lodge business.
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of 0.6m 2010: 0.6m, are deemed to have an infinite life as there is no time limit associated with them.
The franchise fee and brand name agreements are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of periods up to 15 years.

These developments are dependent on the outcome of future events such as the granting of planning permission, and consequently do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year end.
The directors consider that developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of 169.1m over the next five years 2010: 111.1m.
Capitalised interest Interest capitalised during the year amounted to 2.8m, using an average rate of 5.0% 2009 10: 0.5m, using an average rate of 4.4%.
Assets held for sale During the year, certain property assets with a combined net book value of 3.3m 2009 10: 5.0m were transferred to assets held for sale.
Property assets sold during the year had a net book value of 1.2m 2009 10: 2.7m, and six trading sites with a combined net book value of 4.0m 2009 10: 2.3m continued to be classified as assets held for sale at the year end.
An impairment loss of 0.4m 2009 10: 0.6m was recognised in the year relating to assets classifed as held for sale.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 9.7% in the UK with geographic specific percentages overseas 2009 10: 10.0%.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
These business plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of medium term trading prospects.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 2009 10: 2.0%.
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment charge of 13.0m are set out below: Hotels & Restaurants The impairment of 12.1m at 15 sites in this strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors.
Changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated Impairment of assets held for sale to their recoverable value H igh asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth rates at that time than are now expected.
Costa Three UK Costa sites, nine sites in Shanghai and two in the Coffeeheaven business all with an established trend of poor performance against the required capital investment have been impaired by 0.9m where their expected future cash flows have fallen to such a level that their value in use is below carrying value.
Impairment reversals Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of previously impaired sites, reversals of 9.2m have been recognised.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year business plan and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Hotels & Restaurants Costa Total m m m Impairment if business plan growth rates were reduced by 1ppt 1.0 1.0 Impairment if discount rate was increased by 1ppt 1.2 1.2 64 15 Impairment continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
This is calculated using the five year business plans approved by senior management.
The key assumptions in these calculations relate to revenue and the increase in rooms.
The calculation is most sensitive to revenue assumptions, however senior management believe that the assumptions used are reasonable.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.7% 2009 10: 10.0%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to either the Hotels & Restaurants CGU or the Costa CGU.
A review of goodwill acquired in 2010 11 as part of the Coffee Nation acquisition on 2 March 2011 showed no indication of impairment in the current year and will be assessed for impairment as part of the Costa impairment review in future years.
Other intangibles Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and the franchise fee and brand name arrangements acquired with the Premier Lodge business.
Costa have reviewed the intangible assets held in relation to the Russian JV and impaired them down by 0.6m 2009 10: nil.
Hotels & Restaurants have reviewed assets in relation to a site in Dublin and impaired them down by 0.2m 2009 10: nil.

67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 22 Financial liabilities continued Private placement loan notes On 13 August 2010, the Group completed a financing transaction in the United States Private Placement market.
The Group issued loan notes in a combination of both sterling and US dollars at maturities of both seven and 10 years with a fixed coupon payable semi-annually.
Further details of the loan notes are set out below.
Title Principal value Maturity Coupon Series A loan notes $40m 13-Aug-17 4.55% Series B loan notes $75m 13-Aug-20 5.23% Series C loan notes 25m 13-Aug-20 5.19% Following the issue of the Series A loan notes, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 4.55% on a notional amount of $40.0m and pays an average of 4.53% on a notional sterling balance of 26.7m.
These swaps have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge of the Series A loan notes.
The Series B loan notes have been converted to sterling debt with a floating rate coupon by entering into crosscurrency swaps whereby the Group receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% on a notional amount of $75.0m and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m.
These swaps have been formally designated as a fair value hedge of the Series B loan notes, with any fair value movements on both the derivatives and the underlying debt taken to the income statement.
At 3 March 2011 the carrying value of the private placement loan notes included a fair value hedge adjustment of 4.7m which decreased the liability.
The above swaps eliminate any foreign exchange risk on the repayment of the principal amounts of the Series A and B notes.
The sterling denominated Series C loan notes remain as fixed rate sterling debt with no related swap transactions.

Provision is made for rent and other property related costs for the period that a sub-let or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sub-let, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2010: 4.20% based on a 10 year Government Gilt rate as an approximation for a risk free rate.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period of up to 30 years.
69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 24 Provisions continued Reorganisation The reorganisation provisions were created as a result of an overhead review carried out after the disposal of David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Fridays, and for the outsourcing of the Groups logistics operations and the simplification of IT.
The remaining provision relates to the final redundancy costs of the IT simplification project whose implementation has been delayed to 2011 12.
Other Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
These are expected to be used over periods of up to six years.
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix, on a long-term basis, between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
Most of the swaps held at the balance sheet date were entered into in January 2007 as part of a long-term fixing strategy.
However, following the reduction in debt during the year, at year end, 445.9m 84.7% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 3.75 years 2010: 400.7m, 71.4%, for 4.0 years, using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The intention is that the fixed rate debt ratio will reduce going forward to come back in line with Group policy.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.5% 2009 10: 5.6%.
Although the private placement loan rates are US dollar denominated, cross-currency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 3 March 2011 and 4 March 2010 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: B alance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: G ains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 2: and Cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1ppt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.7m 2009 10: 1.2m, and equity by approximately 11.3m 2010: 13.8m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 3 March 2011 and 4 March 2010 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest: Less than 3-12 1-5 More than On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 3 March 2011 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 4.0 2.9 7.1 447.4 117.7 579.1 Derivative financial instruments 8.2 8.2 16.5 10.1 43.0 Trade and other payables 149.1 149.1 Accrued financial liabilities 88.6 15.2 103.8 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 3.1 9.9 15.7 12.5 41.2 4.0 163.3 113.8 494.8 140.3 916.2 70 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk continued Less than 3-12 1-5 More than On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total 4 March 2010 m m m m m m Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 31.3 3.0 2.9 539.1 576.3 Derivative financial instruments 9.4 9.4 34.9 19.6 73.3 Trade and other payables 153.9 8.2 162.1 Accrued financial liabilities 79.4 79.4 Provisions in respect of financial liabilities 19.3 19.1 9.6 48.0 31.3 166.3 111.0 601.3 29.2 939.1 Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 20.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and when they are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern and has sufficient funds, at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 16 and 17 of this report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage debt divided by EBITDA on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below which was achieved for the year ended 3 March 2011.
This calculation takes account of net debt, pensions deficit and capital value of leases.
The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
The Groups financing is subject to financial covenants.
These covenants relate to measurement of EBITDA against consolidated net finance charges interest cover and total net debt leverage ratio, on an unadjusted basis.
The Group has complied with all covenants.
The above matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting processes.
In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding strategy.
71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 26 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups principal financial instruments.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
Carrying values Fair values 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 38.2 47.0 38.2 47.0 Other financial asset 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings 4.0 31.0 4.0 31.0 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 522.1 529.4 522.1 529.4 Derivative financial instruments non-current 16.6 17.2 16.6 17.2 Derivative financial instruments current 16.3 18.9 16.3 18.9 The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20, 24 and 27 are considered to be approximately the same as their carrying amounts.
Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 3 March 2011 m m m m Financial assets Other financial asset 0.9 0.9 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments 32.9 32.9 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 4 March 2010 m m m m Financial assets Other financial asset 0.9 0.9 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments 36.1 36.1 During the year ended 3 March 2011 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 or 3 fair value measurements 2010: nil.
72 26 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 3 March 2011 the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 400m 2010: 400m whereby it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 5.695% 2010: 5.145% and 5.695%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
Following the issue of the Series A loan notes during the year in the US Private Placement market, the Group entered into cross-currency swap whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 4.55% on a notional amount of $40.0m and pays an average of 4.53% on a notional sterling balance of 26.7m.
Fair value hedges Following the issue of the Series B loan notes during the year in the US Private Placement market, the Group entered into cross-currency swap whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 5.23% on a notional amount of $75.0m and pays a spread of between 1.715% and 1.755% over 6m GBP LIBOR on a notional sterling balance of 50.1m.
Cash flow and fair value hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in note 25.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 3 March 2011 and a net unrealised gain of 8.6m 2009 10: net unrealised gain of 3.0m has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
The fair value hedges were also assessed to be highly effective at 3 March 2011 with nil impact on the income statement 2009 10: nil.
During the year, a loss of 18.4m 2009 10: 15.9m was charged to the income statement in respect of hedged items affecting the net finance charge for the year.

During the year no ordinary shares were acquired 2009 10: nil.
No shares were cancelled in the year 2009 10: nil.
The remainder are being held in the treasury reserve note 29.
During the year to 3 March 2011 options over 0.3m ordinary shares, fully paid, were exercised by employees under the terms of various share option schemes 2009 10: 0.2m.
Shareholders were offered a scrip alternative to the 2009 10 cash final dividend of 28.35p and to the 2010 11 cash interim dividend of 11.25p.
Ordinary shares issued in respect of this totalled 491,875.
The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share premium account.
The total number of shares in issue at the year end used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares was 191.4m, less 14.3m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.9m held by the ESOT 2010: 190.6m, less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.5m held by the ESOT.

Other than shares issued in the normal course of business as part of the share-based payments schemes and those issued in respect of scrip dividends, there have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares since the reporting date and before the completion of these financial statements.
29 Reserves Share premium The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Companys 76.80p ordinary shares.
During the year, shares with a nominal value of 0.4m were issued in lieu of the 2009 10 final and 2010 11 interim cash dividends 2009 10: 0.7m.
Capital redemption reserve A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Groups B and C preference shares note 28 and also includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under UK law.
Currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose as a consequence of the merger in 2000 1 of Whitbread Group PLC and Whitbread PLC.
Hedging reserve This reserve records movements for effective cash flow hedges measured at fair value.
74 29 Reserves continued Treasury reserve This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT and treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC.
The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and other incentive schemes.
The movement in treasury shares during the year is set out in the table below: Treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC ESOT shares held million m million m At 26 February 2009 14.7 216.0 0.8 10.3 Exercised during the year 0.3 4.3 At 4 March 2010 14.7 216.0 0.5 6.0 Transferred 0.5 7.3 0.5 7.3 Purchased 0.4 5.1 Exercised during the year 0.5 6.2 At 3 March 2011 14.2 208.7 0.9 12.2 The treasury shares reduce the amount of reserves available for distribution to shareholders by 220.9m 2010: 222.0m.
30 Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses.
The leases are non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time e. g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, future price indices, future market rates of interest.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Due within one year 109.5 93.0 Due after one year but not more than five years 385.8 312.2 Due after five years but not more than ten years 326.0 266.9 Due after ten years 1,025.0 957.1 1,846.3 1,629.2 Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes 94.3m in relation to privity contracts.
Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts provision note 24.
Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 16.0 years 2010: 17.3 years.
Group companies have sub-let space in certain properties.
The future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 3 March 2011 are 18.8m 2010: 21.8m.
Contingent liabilities As disclosed in note 6, during the period the Group received 4.6m refund of VAT charged on gaming machine income, together with associated interest of 0.7m.
The refund was made following a ruling that the application of VAT to certain types of gaming machine income contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC have appealed against the ruling, and if HMRCs appeal is upheld the refund and associated interest of 5.3m would be repayable.
75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 31 Share-based payment plans Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen in the Remuneration report on pages 31 to 38.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2011 2010 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 630,222 359,254 Granted during the year 196,104 356,380 Exercised during the year 95,072 71,088 Expired during the year 29,868 14,324 Outstanding at the end of the year 701,386 630,222 Exercisable at the end of the year Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued employment at that date.
If the director or senior executive of the Group ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If employment ceases for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date that employment ceased.
If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.
Movements in the number of share awards are as follows: 2011 2010 Awards Awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 451,366 385,729 Granted during the year 338,233 249,371 Exercised during the year 379,869 172,047 Expired during the year 2,852 11,687 Outstanding at the end of the year 406,878 451,366 Exercisable at the end of the year Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Annual grants of share options have been discontinued, and there is no current intention to grant any further options.
No changes will be made to options already granted.
The only option still outstanding was granted in 2001 and the performance conditions required the Companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the 10 year performance period starting in March 2001 and ending in March 2011.
76 31 Share-based payment plans continued Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS continued Movements in the number of share options and the related weighted average exercise price WAEP are as follows: 2011 2010 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1,767 5.39 584,616 7.06 Exercised during the year 870 5.39 561,349 6.92 Expired during the year 21,500 11.01 Outstanding at the end of the year 897 5.39 1,767 5.39 Exercisable at the end of the year 897 5.39 1,767 5.39 The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 3 March 2011 is less than one year and they are exercisable at a price of 5.39 2010: 5.39.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for ESOS options exercised during the year was 16.90.
Employee share scheme The employee share save scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount.
The shares can be purchased over the six month period following the third or fifth anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.
Movements in the number of share options and the related WAEP are as follows: 2011 2010 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1,340,142 8.76 1,478,954 8.40 Granted during the year 313,617 14.14 379,528 10.08 Exercised during the year 142,975 10.72 171,364 8.58 Expired during the year 206,752 9.37 346,976 8.85 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,304,032 9.74 1,340,142 8.76 Exercisable at the end of the year 23,081 11.50 22,931 10.15 The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 3 March 2011 is between two and three years and are exercisable at prices between 7.28 and 14.17 2010: 6.53 and 14.17.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for employee share scheme options exercised during the year was 17.22.
Employment service Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
At 3 March 2011 there were outstanding options for employees to purchase up to 1.3m 2010: 1.3m ordinary shares of 76.80 pence each between 2011 and 2016 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share 2010: between 2010 and 2015 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share.
Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee.
32 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a contracted-in defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
The Group also has a contracted-out defined contribution pension scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 3.3m 2009 10: 2.0m.
At the year end, 1,743 employees 2010: 1,641 were active members of the schemes, which also had 6,791 deferred members 2010: 6,769.
Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The scheme is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
At the year end the scheme had no active members 2010: nil, 26,101 deferred pensioners 2010: 26,744 and 16,258 pensions in payment 2010: 15,998.
78 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2008.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee.
The Group will make the following payments to the Fund: 55m in each of August 2011, August 2012 and August 2013: 65m in each of August 2014 and August 2015: 70m in August 2016: 80m in each of August 2017 and August 2018.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation the Trustee has also been given a promise of participation in increases in ordinary dividends where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distribution can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership, which was established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner, and by the Pension Scheme.
A further 39m investment was made during the year on the same basis as the 102m investment made by the Pension Scheme Trustee in the previous financial year.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership, which was also established by the Group during the previous financial year.
Property assets with a market value of 221m have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships, and as such they are fully consolidated in these Group financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next 14 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will be changed, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time, to a value up to 150m 2010: 110m.
At that point, the Group may be required to transfer this amount in cash to the Pension Scheme.
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly the pension deficit position in these Group financial statements does not reflect the 141m 2010: 102m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2011 12 will be nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Towers Watson, using the projected unit credit method.
As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008 of the UK schemes to 3 March 2011 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 3 March 4 March 2011 2010 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.25% 3.30% Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.15% 2.20% Pension increases in deferment 3.45% 3.50% Discount rate 5.60% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.45% 3.50% 1.
T he Whitbread Group Pension fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
From this point active members benefits only increase in line with inflation.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.7 years 2010: 20.6 if they are male and for a further 23.2 years 2010: 23.1 if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2030 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.6 years 2010: 22.5 after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.0 years 2010: 24.9 after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 3 March 2011 rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.25% 2010: 3.30% per annum above inflation.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 m m Current service cost 4.5 Curtailments 4.0 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 0.5 Expected return on scheme assets 82.5 70.5 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 94.0 86.0 Other finance cost note 8 11.5 15.5 The amounts taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 m m Actual return on scheme assets 42.9 243.8 Less: expected return on scheme assets 82.5 70.5 Other actuarial gains and losses 11.8 369.0 51.4 195.7 The current service cost has been included in administrative expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Present value of defined benefit obligations 1,745.0 1,715.0 Fair value of scheme assets 1,257.0 1,281.0 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 488.0 434.0 During the year the accounting deficit increased from 434.0m at 4 March 2010 to 488.0m at 3 March 2011.
The actual returns on assets over the period have been lower than expected based on the expected rate of return and the asset value at the start of the period.
The actual pension increase in February 2011 was higher than the assumption at the start of the period.
This has led to an increase in the defined benefit obligation at 3 March 2011.
This was somewhat offset by a modest gain as a result of changes in other financial assumptions from the beginning to the end of the period.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Opening defined benefit obligation 1,715.0 1,340.0 Current service cost 4.5 Net interest cost 94.0 86.0 Actuarial losses on scheme liabilities 11.8 369.0 Contributions from scheme members 0.5 Benefits paid 75.6 75.0 Curtailments 4.0 Benefits settled by the Company in relation to an unfunded pension scheme 0.2 6.0 Closing defined benefit obligation 1,745.0 1,715.0 80 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Opening fair value of scheme assets 1,281.0 1,107.0 Expected return on scheme assets 82.5 70.5 Actuarial losses gains on scheme assets 39.6 173.3 Contributions from scheme members 0.5 Contributions from employer 1.8 4.7 Additional contributions from Moorgate SLP 6.9 Benefits paid 75.6 75.0 Closing fair value of scheme assets 1,257.0 1,281.0 The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were as follows: Expected return Fair value of assets 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % m m Equities 8.2 8.2 696.2 673.5 Government bonds 4.5 4.5 124.0 163.9 Corporate bonds 5.4 5.4 302.1 332.9 Property 7.0 7.0 41.6 35.9 Cash 4.5 4.5 93.1 74.8 1,257.0 1,281.0 History of experience gains and losses: 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 m m m m m Present value of defined benefit obligations 1,745.0 1,715.0 1,340.0 1,405.0 1,562.0 Fair value of scheme assets 1,257.0 1,281.0 1,107.0 1,372.0 1,366.0 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 488.0 434.0 233.0 33.0 196.0 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities m 25.8 3.0 7.5 7.5 6.0 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1.48% 0.17% 0.60% 0.50% 0.40% Experience adjustments on scheme assets m 39.6 173.0 338.0 66.5 9.5 Percentage of scheme assets % 3.15 % 13.51% 30.50 % 4.80 % 0.70% The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 4 March 2004 in the Group statement of comprehensive income is 437.0 m 2010: 385.6 m. The assumptions in relation to discount rate and mortality have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions: Increase decrease in liability m 0.25% increase to discount rate 70.0 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 55.0 33 Related party disclosure The Groups principal subsidiaries are listed in the following table: % equity interest and votes held Country of Principal subsidiaries Principal activity incorporation 2011 2010 Whitbread Group PLC Hotels and restaurants England 100.0 100.0 Premier Inn Hotels Limited Hotels England 100.0 100.0 Whitbread Restaurants Limited Restaurants England 100.0 100.0 Premier Inn Limited Hotels England 100.0 100.0 Costa Limited Operators of coffee shops and roasters and wholesalers of coffee beans England 100.0 100.0 Yueda Costa Shanghai Food & Beverage Management Company Limited Operators of coffee shops China 51.0 51.0 Coffeeheaven International Limited Operators of coffee shops in eastern Europe England 100.0 100.0 Coffee Nation Limited Operators of customer facing espresso England 100.0 based coffee vending machines 81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 3 March 2011 33 Related party disclosure continued Shares in Whitbread Group PLC are held directly by Whitbread PLC.
