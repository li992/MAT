Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements Estimation of oil and gas reserves oil and gas reserves are key elements in the groups investment decision-making process.
They are also an important element in testing for impairment.
changes in oil and gas reserves, particularly proved and probable reserves, will affect unit-of-production depreciation charges in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i. e. prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.
probable reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered than proved reserves but more certain to be recovered than possible reserves.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to future revision.
Accordingly, financial and accounting measures such as depletion charges and provision for decommissioning that are based on Proved and Probable reserves are also subject to change.
proved reserves are estimated by reference to available reservoir and well information.
All proved reserves estimates are subject to revision, either upward or downward, based on new information, such as from development drilling and production activities or from changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development plans.
in general, changes in the technical maturity of hydrocarbon reserves resulting from new information becoming available from development and production activities have tended to be the most significant cause of annual revisions.
In general, estimates of reserves for undeveloped or partially developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over their future life than estimates of reserves for fields that are substantially developed and being depleted.
As a field goes into production, the amount of proved reserves will be subject to future revision once additional information becomes available through, for example, the drilling of additional wells or the observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing conditions.
As those fields are further developed, new information may lead to revisions.
changes to the groups estimates of proved and probable reserves also affect the amount of depreciation and amortisation recorded in the Groups consolidated financial statements for property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas production activities.
A reduction in proved and probable reserves will increase depreciation and amortisation charges assuming constant production and reduce income.
proved and probable reserve estimates of the group as of 1 november 2011 were based on the reports prepared by Miller and lents ltd, independent engineering consultants.
As at 31 December 2011, the net carrying amount of oil and gas properties and related cost of production licence was $421,388 thousand 2010: $395,829 thousand.
Taxation The Group is subject to income tax and other taxes.
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income tax and other taxes due to the complexity of the tax legislation incorporated in the russian Federation.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates on whether additional tax will be due.
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the amount of tax and tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are regornised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies Note 28.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Directors that make the strategic decisions for the company, who are deemed to be the chief operating decision maker CODM.
52 Exillon Energy Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements Exillon Energy plc manages its business as three operating segments, Exillon WS, Exillon Tp and regional resources.
Exillon Tp: oil company based in the Timan-pechora basin in the Komi republic in the russian Federation.
The revenue is derived from extraction and sale of crude oil.
Exillon WS: oil company based in Western Siberia in the russian Federation.
regional resources: oil trading company based in Moscow in the russian Federation.
53 Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements The transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The groups management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on EBiTDA which is calculated as follows: operating result plus depletion and depreciation, plus minus foreign exchange gains losses and plus minus other significant one-off income expenses.
In 2011, other significant oneoff items included penalty imposed by FSA Note 32, a loss of $1,175 thousand arising on the write-off of non-current assets following the corporate restructuring and $1,074 thousand in relation to write-off of capitalised workover of oil wells.
The measure also excludes the effects of equity-settled share-based payments.
In 2010, EBITDA was reported to the CODM including foreign exchange gains losses and the effect of share-based payments due to the insignificance of these items: the effect of those changes in the measurement method is provided below.
Net back is defined as revenue less selling expenses.
