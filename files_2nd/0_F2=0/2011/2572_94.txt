At 31 March 2011, all of the deferred tax asset of 461m 2010: 2,196m is expected to be recovered after more than one year.
At 31 March 2011, all of the deferred tax liability of 1,212m 2010: 1,456m is expected to be settled after more than one year.
The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 28% to 26% on 1 April 2011.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2011 have been calculated using a rate of 26%.
The impact of the change of rate decreased deferred tax assets by 35m and deferred tax liabilities by 91m totalling a reduction in net liabilities of 56m.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 172m in the income statement note 10 and a deferred tax expense of 116m in other comprehensive income.
The UK Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The future annual corporation tax reductions of 1% are expected to affect the groups financial statements.
The actual impact will depend on the groups deferred tax position at that time.
At 31 March 2011 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 23.5bn 2010: 29.5bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2011 Expiry of At 31 March m losses Restricted losses: Americas 254 2012-31 Europe 1,492 2012-26 Asia 14 2012-16 Total restricted losses 1,760 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 3,440 No expiry Capital losses 17,771 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 21,211 Other temporary differences 536 Total 23,507 At 31 March 2011, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 5.3bn 2010: 5.5bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.
