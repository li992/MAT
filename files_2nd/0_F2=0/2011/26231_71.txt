14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the Groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is dened as the profit after tax derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.
A reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations is provided below: i Earnings per share profit Tax profit Earnings profit Tax profit Earnings before tax expense after tax per share before tax expense after tax per share 2011 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2010 m m m p m m m p Operating profit 1,056 269 787 13.50 1,002 251 751 12.89 Variation from longer term investment return 97 42 55 0.94 90 16 74 1.27 Impact of change in UK taxrates 6 6 0.10 5 5 0.09 Earnings per share based on profit attributable to equity holders 959 233 726 12.46 1,092 272 820 14.07
