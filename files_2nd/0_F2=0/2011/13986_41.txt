The rules are based on those of the UK in that employees must be eligible and there is a monthly savings contract over a 3 year period.
In In 2011, options were granted to both UK and Netherlands scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken the day prior to the date of invitations to apply for an option.
