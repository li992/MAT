The net increase in goodwill from 133m to 138m mainly reflects 4m of additional consideration payable.
This has not had a material impact on the consolidated accounts and, as such, the Group has not restated the balance sheet at 31 December 2010.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Atlantic Marine of 37m primarily relate to customer relationships.
Total consideration in respect of the acquisition of OASYS includes $29m 18m contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for 2010 and 2011.

ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES continued Outstanding issues concerning the acquisition of the Tenix Defence business in 2008, including the completion accounting process, were resolved successfully with agreement of contingent payments totalling A$127.5m 74m, net of legal fees from the former owners of the business.
In September 2010, the Group received a payment of A$112.5m 65m, net of legal fees with the remainder received in 2011.
These payments reduced goodwill in 2010 by 64m 74m, less 10m deferred tax.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT A discussion of the Groups treasury objectives and policies, and the use of financial instruments can be found in the Directors report.
Financial instruments comprise net debt as defined by the Group note 10 together with other financial assets and other financial liabilities note 17.
Hedging instruments The notional, or contracted, amounts of derivative financial instruments are shown below, analysed between foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts, classified by year of maturity.

The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.
The following table compares the estimated fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities to their carrying values at the balance 1 sheet date.
Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Assets Non-current 2 Other receivables 261 261 233 233 Other financial assets 118 118 110 110 Current Available-for-sale investments 260 260 Other financial assets 77 77 289 289 Cash and cash equivalents 2,141 2,141 2,813 2,813 Liabilities Non-current Loans 2,682 3,554 2,133 2,598 Other financial liabilities 74 74 255 255 Current Loans and overdrafts 518 518 920 940 Other financial liabilities 284 284 109 109 1 The estimated fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities are consistent with their carrying values at the balance sheet date.
2 Net carrying amount approximates to estimated fair value as there is no active market.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Collateral As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2011 totalled nil 2010 nil.
Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2010 50% and a maximum of 75% 2010 75% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had 63% 2010 65% of fixed rate debt and 37% 2010 35% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 3.1bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2010 3.0bn.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Between Less than one and More than one year two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 2,141 Loans and overdrafts 1,167 649 The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2011, the Group had a total of $1.8bn 2010 $1.5bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 2.8 years 2010 4.6 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 10.4 years 2010 5.7 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 3.1% 2010 3.3%, 3.1% on US dollars and 2.5% on sterling 2010 2.7% on US dollars and 1.8% on sterling.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 6.0% 2010 6.5%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 12m 2010 12m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 7m 2010 16m.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2010 2bn.
The RCF is contracted until 2015 and was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper issued by the Group.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had 513m 2010 144m of Commercial Paper in issue.
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
Credit risk The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash.
It is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short periods.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2011 of 2,141m 2010 2,813m was invested with 24 2010 24 financial institutions.
A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The Group has no exposure to Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish banks.
Additionally, the Group monitors its exposure to banks which have exposure to those countries.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk through this process.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK and US governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables, no one counterparty constitutes more than 6% of the balance 2010 5%.
166 BAE Systems Annual Report 2011 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS OTHER INFORMATION continued 27.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly the US dollar, Euro and Saudi Arabian riyal.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material firm transactional exposures are hedged, unless otherwise approved as exceptions by the Treasury Review Management Committee, and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement or balance sheet of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Hedges are, however, undertaken in respect of investments that are not considered long term or core to the Group.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The global nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flow exposures over the medium term.
The Group also uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
