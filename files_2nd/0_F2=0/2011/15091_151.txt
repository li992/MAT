Within this amount, 340m was identified as intangible assets and goodwill, of which the Directors believe that 187m should be deductible against taxable profits over the useful economic lives of the respective assets.
This gave rise to 52.4m of the exceptional deferred tax credit booked in 2010.
Based on this the Directors consider that the Groups future cash tax expense should be reduced by approximately 3.8m per annum.
The Groups corporation tax expense of 13.8m, excluding exceptional items, represents an effective tax rate of 29.2% for the period ended 1 May 2011.
This is slightly higher than the statutory rate of 27.8% primarily due to the non-deductibility of costs associated with the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA.
Taking into account the annual tax amortisation of goodwill, as discussed above and adjusting for non-taxable IFRS adjustments included within profit before tax, the effective cash tax rate for the period is 22.9%.
The UK corporation tax rate reduction from 28% to 26%, with effect from 1 April 2011 is substantially enacted at the balance sheet date so the deferred tax balances at 1 May 2011 have been remeasured resulting in an exceptional deferred tax charge of 3.4m.
The reduction in rate from 26% to 25% was not enacted until 5 July 2011 and so does not impact the current year, but a deferred tax charge of 1.7m should arise in the following period as a result of the re-measurement of deferred tax balances to 25%.
Discussions continue with HMRC to agree that the deferred tax asset recognised in the balance sheet is recoverable.
The Directors are confident that allowance will be granted in full.
