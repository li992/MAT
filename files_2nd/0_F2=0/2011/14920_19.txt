NotEs to tHE fiNANCiAl stAtEMENts 1 Accounting policies SThree plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate predominantly in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.
The Groups activities and business are set out in the Directors Report.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and the Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of its registered office is 5th Floor, GPS House, 215-227 Great Portland Street, London, W1W 5PN.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted and endorsed by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards Regulation.
The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement and statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company.
During the period the Board elected to separate the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income into a Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The decision to separate the statements has been to align with industry presentation practice and to clearly disclose the entitys profit for the period.
The financial year of the Group comprises 52 weeks and not a calendar year.
Restatement of the consolidated statements Included in other comprehensive income for the period ended 28 November 2010 was 1,347,000 relating to employee share awards, and deferred and current tax on employee share options of 258,000 and 155,000 respectively.
These represented transactions with owners and should have been reflected directly in equity.
Therefore, these amounts have been removed from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year affected.
As a result of this change other comprehensive income for the year ended 28 November 2010 has been restated to 3,603,000 compared to 1,843,000 previously reported.
In the Statement of cash flows for the period ended 28 November 2010, the tax paid was disclosed as a gross amount and excluded any refunds of tax paid in the period of 3.2m.
The corresponding entry reduces the effects of foreign exchange rates on cash and therefore has no impact on the cash flows from operating activities or opening and closing cash and cash equivalents.
As a result of this change, income tax paid has been restated to 2,758,000 compared to 5,958,000 and the effect of exchange rate changes has been restated to 2,069,000 compared to 1,131,000 as previously reported.
The restatements have no impact on the income statement or operating profit.
Significant accounting policies The Groups accounting policies, as set out below, have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS since 1 December 2004.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
Management consider that the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates affect the consolidated financial statements, do not substantially impact the results.
There were no new International Financial Reporting Standards or interpretations that had to be implemented during the year that affect these financial statements.
As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
The Group has not applied these standards and interpretations in the preparation of financial statements.
The revised Standard IAS 24 Related Parties Disclosure is effective from periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
The standard revises the definition of a related party and clarifies that disclosure is required of any commitments of a related party 62 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued to do something if a particular event occurs or does not occur in the future, including executory contracts recognised and unrecognised.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will establish principles for the financial reporting of financial assets that will present relevant and useful information to users of financial statements for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of the entitys future cash flows.
The standard is applicable for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.
The impact on the Groups financial statements of the future adoption of these standards and interpretations is still under review, but the Group does not expect any of these changes to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are fide-consolidated from the date when control ceases.
Foreign currencies i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that subsidiary operates its functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all of the Groups subsidiaries none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the Groups presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period: income and expenses for each income statement are translated using the average rate of exchange unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group treats specific inter-company loan balances, which are not intended to be settled for the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment in the relevant subsidiaries.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Revenue and revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services provided in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is shown net of value added tax and other sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts and after elimination of sales within the Group.
Contract revenue for the supply of professional services is recognised based on the number of hours worked by a contractor.
Revenue for permanent placements is recognised when candidates commence employment.
A provision is established for non-fulfilment of permanent placement and contract obligations, which is offset within Trade and other receivables on the face of the Statement of financial position and offset against revenue in the income statement.
SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 63 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued Finance income Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Segment reporting The Group operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services.
The Group operates in three geographic segments being the United Kingdom and Ireland, Continental Europe and the Rest of the World.
Dividends Interim and special dividends are recognised in the financial statements at the time they are paid.
The final dividends declared to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Companys and Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
The Company recognises dividends from subsidiaries at the time that they are received.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the depreciable value of property, plant and equipment to the income statement over their useful economic lives as follows: Computer equipment 33.33% per annum Leasehold improvement 20% per annum Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum Motor vehicles 33.33% per annum Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of the reporting period.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts.
These are included in the income statement.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying value is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Assets under construction Purchased fixed assets or internally generated intangible assets that are still under development are classified as Assets under construction.
These assets are reclassified over the phased completion dates and are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Computer software The cost of acquired computer software licenses is capitalised.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives up to three years on a straight line basis.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense to the income statement when incurred.
64 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued Software and system development costs Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design or improvement of systems where the related expenditure is separately identifiable, measurable and management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial viability of the project, such that it will generate future economic benefits based on all relevant available information are recognised as intangible assets in line with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Capitalised software and system development costs are amortised from the date the system is available for use over their expected useful lives not exceeding five years on a straight line basis.
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense to the income statement as incurred.
Trademarks Trademarks are initially recognised at cost.
They have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks over their estimated useful lives up to twelve years.
Impairment of assets Assets that are not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, by analysing individual assets or classes of assets that naturally belong together.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is measured based on the expected future discounted cash flows DCF model attributable to the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Investments The Companys investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the parent company, they are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary and the Companys investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either held to maturity or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Held to maturity financial assets Held-to-maturity financial assets comprises investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity for which there is a positive intention and ability to hold to maturity and which have not been designated at fair value through the income statement or as available for sale.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
Trade and other receivables Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realisable value after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Group makes judgements on an entity by entity basis as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of significant outstanding invoices.
For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing percentages based on the age of the receivable.
In determining these percentages, the Group analyses its historical collection experience and current economic trends.
Trade receivable balances are written off when the Group determines that it is unlikely that future remittances will be received.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within current financial liabilities on SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 65 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued the statement of financial position unless they form part of a cash pooling arrangement in which case they are reported net of related cash balances.
Financial liabilities All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period.
Net investment hedging Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Groups net investment in an overseas operation.
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Group income statement.
Leases Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease periods.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Short term financial liabilities and overdrafts Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Financial liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are recognised as the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
No provision is recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligation as a whole.
A provision may be recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Taxation Corporation tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profits for the period.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
66 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from the equity attributable to the companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
Pension obligations the Group has defined contribution plans and pays contributions to privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on the Directors best estimate of the amounts due.
The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice of payments that has created a constructive obligation.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for those benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without the possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Employee Benefit Trust The Employee Benefit Trust EBT was originally funded by gifts from certain of the Companys shareholders and Directors.
The assets and liabilities of the EBT are consolidated into the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The shares in the EBT are held to satisfy awards and grants under the employee share award, share option schemes and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, all of which were gifted or newly issued shares and hence no cost is attributed to those shares and no amounts are shown in the Groups financial statements.
Share-based compensation The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At the end of each reporting period before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous end of the reporting period is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
For certain share based payment settlements there exists an obligation on the Group to repay amounts if the employee leaves the employment of the Group before the settlement vests.
In these circumstances a provision is established in relation to this obligation.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 67 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 1 Accounting policies continued Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid, up to the fair value of the award, at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on the Directors best knowledge of the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty made by the Directors in these financial statements are set out below.
A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in using DCF models to forecast operating cash flows, e. g. with respect to factors such as market growth rates, revenue volumes, market prices for services and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cash flows are based on best estimates of future revenues and operating expenses using historical trends, general market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management and the Board of Directors.
The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate pre-tax discount rate derived from the Groups cost of capital.
i The determination of the carrying amount of capitalised software and systems development costs and assets under construction and the estimation of useful economic life and recoverability of such assets is deemed to be judgemental.
ii The Group follows the guidance in IAS 39 to determine when trade and other receivables are impaired.
This determination requires significant judgement.
In making this judgement, the Group evaluates, amongst other factors, the duration and extent to which the carrying values of a receivable is less than its cost, the risk profile of the client and other credit rating factors, the financial health, historical experience of and near-term business outlook for the client.
iii Revenue is recognised when the supply of professional services has been rendered.
It also includes an assessment of professional services received by the client for the placement of temporary services between the date of the last received timesheet and the year end.
Unsubmitted timesheets are estimated to the extent that an open contract has not expired during the period under assessment.
Management apply judgement to several factors in estimating the revenue and cost of sales accruals: any difference compared to actual experience would result in the amount payable to the contractor and receivable from the client being adjusted in the next financial year.
The judgement applied, and the assumptions underlying these judgements are considered to be appropriate.
However, a change in these assumptions would impact upon both the amount of revenue and cost of sales recognised.
iv The Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of 6.4m 2010: 8.7m, of which 5.5m 2010: 7.1m related to trading losses that are to be carried forward and relieved against profits arising in future periods.
The judgement to recognise the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Groups expectations regarding future profitability based upon subsidiary revenue and cost forecasts for future years which contain a degree of inherent uncertainty.
v The fair value of equity settled share-based payments is partly derived from estimates of factors such as lapse rates and achievement of performance criteria.
It is also derived from assumptions such as the future volatility of the Companys share price, expected dividend yields and risk-free interest rates.
2 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting requires management to apply the management approach to segmental reporting.
This requires management to determine those segments whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entitys chief operating decision maker to make strategic decisions and assess sector performance.
Revenue and Gross Profit by reportable segment Management has determined the chief operating decision maker to be the Executive Committee made up of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Strategy Officer, the Chief Information Officer, the Director of Strategic Capability, the Regional Managing Directors and key function heads.
Operating segments have been identified based on reports reviewed by the Executive Committee, which considers the business primarily from the geographic perspective.
68 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 2 Segmental analysis continued The Groups management reporting and controlling systems use accounting polices that are the same as those described in note 1 in the summary of significant accounting policies under IFRS.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments through a measure of segment profit or loss which is referred to as Gross Profit in the management and reporting system.
Gross Profit is the measure of segment profit loss used in segment reporting and comprises revenue less cost of sales.
Intersegment revenue is recorded at values which approximate third party selling prices and is not significant.

Under IFRS the Group is required to provide for deferred tax on all unexercised share awards and options.
Where the amount of the tax deduction or estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, this indicates that the tax deduction relates not only to remuneration expense but also to an equity item.

74 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 8 Earnings per share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share EPS is based on the following data.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the EBT which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential shares.

Goodwill The net book values at 27 November 2011 and 28 November 2010 are as follows: Net book value Groups 2011 2010 Investment in shareholding 000 000 SThree Staffing UK Limited 100% 833 833 Jobboard Enterprises Limited 80% 415 415 1,248 1,248 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 77 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 10 Intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that cash-generating unit based on value in use.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and an average annual growth rate of 5% over the next five years.
A terminal value of the cash flow is then calculated by assuming growth of 3%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating-unit is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Software and system development cost In 2008, the Group began a phased rollout of a Customer Relationship Management CRM system to complement the frontoffice system.
Further costs directly attributable to the development of the new systems have been capitalised during the year.
During the year the Group introduced a new flexible and scaleable consolidation, budgeting and forecasting system.
As the company grows internationally, this new system addresses the need to be able to consolidate, budget and produce rolling forecasts for legal entities across an increasing number of jurisdictions which places even greater importance on the use of a flexible tool that can accommodate change and deliver speed of reporting.
A further addition is the development of an enterprise datawarehouse system in conjunction with the introduction of an advanced set of interrogation, reporting and analytical tools to create a common and improved reporting environment.
Recoverable amounts The recoverable amounts used for impairment testing of intangible fixed assets is based on value-in-use calculations using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 10.2% 2010: 9.5%.
The Group has used the same discount rate for each cash generating unit as they are all considered to have the same risk profile.
The future cash flow projections are based on approved financial budgets.
Average growth rates used to estimate cash flows for the first five years are in line with Board approved forecasts, with the growth rate assumption thereafter limited to the expected growth rate of the local economy.

In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets the carrying values of the Companys investments in subsidiaries have been allocated to their cash-generating units to assess their value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget and an average annual growth rate of 5% 2010: 5%.
A terminal value of cash flow is then calculated by assuming growth of 3%, discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to projected future net cash flows to arrive at the valuation was 10.2% 2010: 9.5%.
IFRS 2 requires that any options or awards granted to employees of a subsidiary company for which no recharge is made will increase the carrying value of the investment held.
In 2011, the Group has recognised an increase in the investments in its subsidiaries of 1.4m 2010: 1.3m relating to these share options and awards.
Group Reorganisation As part of the reorganisation during the year ended 28 November 2010, the Group undertook a share for share exchange for most of the non-controlling interests held.
There was no material effect from the share transfers and no effect on the Group cashflow position.
These subsidiaries were subsequently transferred by way of a share exchange to either SThree UK Holdings Limited or SThree Overseas Holdings Limited.
During the current year there were further movements in the remaining noncontrolling interests.

The Group has tax losses of 19.1m for the year 2010: 24.5m in respect of overseas territories for which a deferred tax asset has been recognised on consolidation.
The Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of 1.2m 2010: nil in respect of losses of 3.8m that can be carried forward in respect of taxable income.
Tax effected losses amounting to 1.2m and 0.4m expire in 2015 to 2017 and 2028 to 2031, respectively.
Remaining tax effected losses of 3.9m have no expiry period.
During the current period losses have been incurred in certain of the groups overseas territories for which a cumulative deferred tax asset of 4.1m is held at the year end.
The recoverability of these tax losses is dependent on the availability of future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
In assessing whether to recognise the deferred tax asset the Group have considered both the current and the forecast trading performance in these territories and expectations regarding the levels of profitability that can be achieved.
In March 2011 the Finance Bill 2011 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
As a result of this the Groups deferred tax asset has been reduced as at 27 November 2011 by 173,000 resulting in a charge to the income statement of 58,000 and a charge to equity of 115,000.
Unremitted earnings As at 27 November 2011, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 6.6m 2010: 20.8m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax and UK tax after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
However, no tax is expected to be payable on them because, as at the end of the reporting period, there are no plans to remit these earnings.
Therefore no provision for tax in respect of possible future remittances has been made.

For the purpose of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the Binomial option pricing model has been used for schemes with total shareholder return performance targets.
The assumptions used in the model for the 2011 year are as follows: Weighted average fair value 56.91p Key assumptions used: Weighted average share price 245.00p Exercise prices 196.00p Range of expected volatility 31% Risk-free interest rate 3.75% Range of expected option term 3 years Dividend yield 4.90% During the year, the Group recognised a cost of 0.2m 2010: nil in relation to the SAYE scheme.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP was approved by shareholders on 24 April 2009.
Under the SIP employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, wherever available, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
Best estimates have been used where historical data is not available in this respect.

Approved executive share option scheme Options over 5.25 million ordinary shares were granted by the Board to certain employees on 3 December 2004.
These were exercisable within 10 years from the date of grant.
These options were subject to a performance condition requiring that over a five year period a certain level of profits has to be achieved.
Unapproved share option scheme At IPO 16 November 2005, the Board awarded 433,749 Ordinary Shares and issued 505,710 share options to certain current and former employees who were considered to have contributed to the Groups continued success.
The share options are exercisable immediately upon grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant.
The Group recognised a charge in the income statement for the year ended 30 November 2005, in accordance with IFRS 2, amounting to 1,878,918 representing the fair value of the options awarded at the date of grant.
c Share awards in subsidiary companies previously Non-controlling interest As described in the Directors report the Group makes awards of shares in subsidiary businesses to certain entrepreneurial employees who will participate in the development of those businesses.
SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 87 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 19 Share Capital and reserves continued c Share awards in subsidiary companies previously Non-controlling interest continued These awards generally have the following characteristics: an employee receives an award of a tracker share in a subsidiary business.
This share gives the employee certain rights to income and capital growth of a tracked business: the employee must subscribe for his her award of tracker shares at fair value, as determined by an independent third party share valuer and taking into account the particular rights attached to the shares described in the relevant businesses Articles of Association.
The value takes into consideration factors such as the size and trading record of the underlying business, budget projections, expected distribution rates, as well as the external market, sector and country data.
The external valuer is supplied with detailed analysis down to Profit Before Tax.
Using this information an independent calculation of the initial Equity Value EV is completed based on ratio analysis and modelling of financial information extracted from a sample of comparable quoted stocks.
This EV is then discounted down to take account of small scale risk, minority status, share liquidity and the absence of voting rights to arrive at a valuation.
A number of awards were granted in the year and, although the methodology for calculating the EVs was applied consistently, the data used varied depending on the business and timing of the grant date: if the employee remains in employment with the Group for a pre-agreed period, not less than three years, he she may then offer his her tracker shares for sale to SThree plc.
Should SThree plc decide to buy back the tracker shares, it will do so at a price based on a multiple of the tracker shares fair value at that date and SThree plc may settle this transaction in cash or in SThree plc shares, as it chooses.
The current policy is to settle in shares.
During the period of tracker share ownership, the employee may be entitled to a cash distribution at the discretion of the Group: if the employee leaves the Group before the pre-agreed period, being not less than three years depending on the life of the tracker, he she is entitled to receive the lower of the initial subscription amount he she contributed or the fair value on the date of his her departure as set out under the relevant businesses Articles of Association.
A provision relating to the obligation to repay amounts received or receivable in relation to tracker shares is recognised: employees may receive loans from the Group to pay for their tracker shares, on which interest is accrued.
These loans are included within other receivables.

25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors Financial risk factors The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits.
The role of Corporate Treasury is to manage and monitor external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury management, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, meets on a monthly basis to review treasury activities.
Its members receive management information relating to treasury activities.
Our internal auditors regularly review the Treasury internal control environment.
In previous years, Group treasury entered into a small amount of derivative transactions, principally currency swaps and forward currency contracts with the purpose of managing the currency risks arising from operations and financing.
The Board undertook a review of its currency hedging strategy to ensure it is appropriate and currently does not actively manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk by the use of financial instruments.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and our Treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity.
All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and thus not engaged in speculative trading.
The Group is exposed to a number of different financial risks including foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity, interest rates, and credit risk.
The Groups objective and strategy in responding to these risks is set out below.
a Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group has net cash of 55.6m 2010: 55.2m and holds no debt.
On 19 January 2012, the Company signed a committed revolving credit facility of 20m with Royal Bank of Scotland which expires in January 2017.
Total capital at 27 November 2011 was: 27 November 28 November 2011 2010 000 000 Cash 55,605 51,718 Fixed rate sterling deposit 3,500 Total equity 82,467 81,918 Total capital 138,072 137,136 b Foreign currency exchange risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the Euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenues, cost of sales, the translation of the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from the value of net investments outside the United Kingdom.
The settlement of intercompany balances held with foreign operations is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Therefore, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investments are taken into equity.
SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 91 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued b Foreign currency exchange risk continued The Groups businesses generally raise invoices and incur expenses in their local currencies.
Local currency cash generated is remitted via intercompany transfers to the United Kingdom.
The Group generally converts foreign currency balances into Sterling to manage its cash flows.
The anticipated impact on the Groups results if the Euro strengthened against Sterling by a movement of more than 10% in terms of translational exposure amounts to an increase in profit before tax by 3.5m 2010: 2.8m.
If the Euro weakened against Sterling by more than 10% this would result in a decrease in profit before tax of 3.5m 2010: 2.8m.
10% was used on the assumption that rates are not likely to move by more less than this percentage given the history during the year.
The table below provides exchange rates used by the Group for translation of the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations.
Weighted average rate Closing rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 Euro 0.8698 0.8691 0.8577 0.8499 US dollar 0.6247 0.6458 0.6479 0.6417 Hong Kong dollar 0.0803 0.0832 0.0831 0.0827 Australian dollar 0.6431 0.5852 0.6295 0.6193 Singapore dollar 0.4959 0.4695 0.4935 0.4865 c Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains committed facilities to enable it to finance its day-to-day operations, based on cash flow projections.
The Group invests surplus cash in interest-earning deposit accounts or bonds with UK and European banks note 13, and complied with all its covenants in the year.
The Groups treasury function centrally co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management.
The Group believes it has access to sufficient funding through an invoice financing arrangement that provides a committed borrowing facility of 20m and expires in April 2012.
The table below shows the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on the contractual amounts payable on the date of repayment: Trade and other payables Bank overdraft Group Company Group Company At 27 November 2011 000 000 000 000 Within one year 85,479 1,675 23,750 At 28 November 2010 Within one year 77,495 67,003 445 d Interest rate risk The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally financial liabilities.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit, the invoice discounting facility and, when required, bank overdrafts.
The Group does not hedge the exposure to variations in interest rates presented by the above instruments.
Taking into consideration all variable rate borrowings and cash in place as at 27 November 2011, if the interest rate payable or receivable moved by 100 basis points in either direction then the effect to the Group would be minimal.
92 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued e Credit Risk In the normal course of business, the Group participates in cash pooling arrangements with its counterparty bank.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 38m 2010: 30m.
The Group will not accept any counterparty bank unless it has been awarded a minimum recognised credit rating of A3 Prime-2 Moodys.
The Group will permit exposures with individual counterparty banks and exposure types up to pre-defined limits as part of the Group treasury policy.
Exposures to all transaction limits are monitored daily.
Trade and other receivables of the Group are analysed in the table below.
With respect to the trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.
The Group mitigates its credit risk by using a credit rating agency to assess new clients and payment history to assess further credit extensions to existing clients.
In addition, the spread of SME client base circa 7,000 clients helps to mitigate the risk of individual client failure having a material impact on the Group.
The Group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables, hence the outstanding balance is included in the analysis based on the original payment terms.
There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding at year end.
As of 27 November 2011, trade receivables of 23.9m 2010: 24.9m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
As of 27 November 2011, trade receivables of 3.0m 2010: 3.1m were impaired.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: 2011 2010 Trade receivables 000 000 Neither impaired nor past due 45,044 36,868 Not impaired and past due in the following periods within 30 days 18,950 19,859 31 to 60 days 3,686 4,211 61 to 90 days 1,284 821 Impaired within 90 days 64 105 over 90 days 2,917 2,998 Provision 1,487 1,767 Total 70,458 63,095 SThree plc Report & financial statements 2011 93 Notes to the FiNaNcial statemeNts 25 Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued f Interest rate profile of financial assets liabilities The following tables set out the exposure of financial assets and liabilities to either fixed interest rates, floating interest rates or no interest rates.

Important risk variables are stock exchange prices or indices.
As of 27 November 2011, the entity did not hold any material investments to be classified as available for sale or as held for trading.
Therefore there are no financial instruments which would be materially impacted by risk variables affecting the price of financial instruments.

Other foreign currencies held by the Group include the following: Swiss Francs, United Arab Emirates Dirhams, Australian Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, Singapore Dollars, Swedish Kronor, Bahrain Dinars, Kuwait Dinars, Qatar Riyals, Saudi Arabia Riyals, Indian Rupees and Brazilian Real.
h Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are equal to their fair values.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
A summary of the assumptions used for each category of financial instrument is set out below.
Summary of methods and assumptions Short-term deposits and borrowings Approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents Approximates to the carrying amount.
Receivables and payables Approximates to the carrying amount for current balances: there are no material longer term balances.
Financial instruments Market valuations at the end of the reporting period.
26 Contingent Liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
They are not anticipated to result in a material cash outflow for the Group.
