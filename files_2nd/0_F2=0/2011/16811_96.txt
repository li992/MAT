Impairment Impairment losses The net impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement, as a separate line item within operating profit, in respect of goodwill and licences and spectrum fees are as follows: 1 2011 2010 2009 Cash generating unit Reportable segment m m m Italy Italy 1,050 Spain Spain 2,950 3,400 2 Greece Other Europe 800 2 Ireland Other Europe 1,000 2 Portugal Other Europe 350 Turkey Other Europe 200 2,250 India India 2,300 Ghana Other Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific 250 6,150 2,100 5,900 Notes: 1 Impairment charges for the year ended 31 March 2011 relate solely to goodwill.
2 Total impairment losses in the Other Europe segment were 2,150 million in the year ended 31 March 2011.
Year ended 31 March 2011 The impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.
The pre-tax adjusted discount rates used in the most recent value in use calculation in the year ended 31 March 2011 are as follows: Pre-tax adjusted discount rate Italy 11.9% Spain 11.5% Greece 14.0% Ireland 14.5% Portugal 14.0% During the year ended 31 March 2011 the goodwill in relation to the Groups investments in Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal was impaired by 1,050 million, 2,950 million, 800 million, 1,000 million and 350 million, respectively.
The impairment charges were primarily driven by increased discount rates as a result of increases in government bond rates.
In addition, business valuations were negatively impacted by lower cash flows within business plans, reflecting weaker country-level macro economic environments.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates used in the previous value in use calculations at 31 March 2010 are disclosed below.
Year ended 31 March 2010 The net impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.
The pre-tax adjusted discount rates used in the value in use calculation in the year ended 31 March 2010 were as follows: Pre-tax adjusted discount rate India 13.8% Turkey 17.6% Financials Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2011 99 During the year ended 31 March 2010 the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in India was impaired by 2,300 million primarily due to intense price competition following the entry of a number of new operators into the market.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 March 2009 was 12.3%.
In addition, impairment losses of 200 million, previously recognised in respect of intangible assets in relation to the Groups operations in Turkey, were reversed.
The reversal was in relation to licences and spectrum and was as a result of favourable changes in the discount rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plans used for impairment testing were substantially unchanged from those used at 31 March 2009.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the previous value in use calculation at 31 March 2009 was 19.5%.
Year ended 31 March 2009 The impairment losses were based on value in use calculations.
The pre-tax adjusted discount rates used in the value in use calculation in the year ended 31 March 2009 were as follows: Pre-tax adjusted discount rate Spain 10.3% Turkey 19.5% Ghana 26.9% During the year ended 31 March 2009 the goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in Spain was impaired by 3,400 million following a fall in long-term cash flow forecasts resulting from the economic downturn.
In addition, the goodwill and other intangible assets in relation to the Groups operations in Turkey was impaired by 2,250 million.
At 30 September 2008 the goodwill was impaired by 1,700 million following adverse movements in the discount rate and adverse performance against previous plans.
During the second half of the 2009 financial year, impairment losses of 300 million in relation to goodwill and 250 million in relation to licences and spectrum resulted from adverse changes in both the discount rate and a fall in the long-term GDP growth rate.
The cash flow projections within the business plans used for impairment testing were substantially unchanged from those used at 30 September 2008.
The goodwill in relation to the Groups operations in Ghana was also impaired by 250 million following an increase in the discount rate.
Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill at 31 March was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Germany 12,200 12,301 Italy 13,615 14,786 Spain 7,133 10,167 32,948 37,254 Other 12,288 14,584 45,236 51,838 100 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
Impairment continued Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are: Assumption How determined Budgeted EBITDA Budgeted EBITDA has been based on past experience adjusted for the following: voice and messaging revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage from new customers, the introduction of new services and traffic moving from fixed networks to mobile networks, though these factors will be offset by increased competitor activity, which may result in price declines, and the trend of falling termination rates: non-messaging data revenue is expected to continue to grow strongly as the penetration of 3G enabled devices and smartphones rises and new products and services are introduced: and margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as an increase in the cost of acquiring and retaining customers in increasingly competitive markets and the expectation of further termination rate cuts by regulators and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the implementation of Group initiatives.
Budgeted capital expenditure The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide enhanced voice and data products and services and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the Groups licences.
Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Long-term growth rate For businesses where the five year management plans are used for the Groups value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the long-term compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
For businesses where the plan data is extended for an additional five years for the Groups value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of: the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation: and the compound annual growth rate in EBITDA in years nine to ten of the management plan.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Groups operations is generally based on the risk free rate for ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
Where government bond rates contain a material component of credit risk, high quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific Group operating company.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each of the Groups operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory.
Management has used a forward-looking equity market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating acquisition proposals.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
31 March 2011 The estimated recoverable amounts of the Groups operations in Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal equalled their respective carrying values and, consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Groups operations in Turkey, India and Ghana exceeded their carrying values by approximately 1,481 million, 977 million and 138 million, respectively.
