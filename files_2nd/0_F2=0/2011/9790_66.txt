No benefit has been recognised in respect of unexpired trading losses carried forward in overseas jurisdictions with a tax value of 16.1m last year 8.8m.
In addition, the Group is claiming UK tax relief for losses incurred by some of its current and former European subsidiaries.
In light of the continuing litigation no asset has been recognised in respect of these claims.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the temporary differences arising on investments in overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversals of those differences, and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate temporary difference in respect of these overseas investments is 93.5m last year 95.7m.
