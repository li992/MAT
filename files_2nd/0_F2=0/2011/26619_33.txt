Man Group plc 73 Annual Report 2011 20.
Pension benefits Man operates 12 2010: 11 defined contribution plans and two 2010: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $8 million 2010: $6 million.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss plan.
At 31 March 2011, the UK plan comprised 78% 2010: 80% of the total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999.
The Swiss plan remains open to new members.
The asset recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of the plan assets including the Reservoir Trust described below less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
This net asset or liability represents the shareholders obligation to the pension plans and the potential use of the Mans resources in the future.
The latest funding valuation of the UK plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2008 and indicated a deficit of 75 million.
Man has agreed that from April 2010 additional cash contributions each year will be made to cover the cost of accruing benefits less the contributions made by active members.
In addition, to remove the funding deficit it was agreed that Man would pay 7.3 million every year from March 2010 until 31 March 2015 with a further lump sum to be paid in March 2016 to cover any remaining funding deficit at 31 December 2015.
Under these arrangements 7.3 million 2010: 7.3 million of cash contributions were made to the UK plan this year.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK plan, Man also set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 49 million or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2015 and in the event that the UK plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the plan is not overfunded.
In addition, to reduce the pension liabilities in the UK plan, Man offered deferred members the ability to transfer their pension out at an enhanced amount to the current value of their pension.
This allowed participants, at their option, the flexibility to move their pension to an alternative investment plan.
36 percent of participants transferred their pensions and reduced the future pension obligation by 29 million.
For Man this process reduced the risk of longevity, interest rate and inflation changes on the future pension liability, and reduced the administration cost of the UK plan.
The amounts recognised in the Statement of Financial Position are determined as follows: $m 2011 2010 Present value of funded obligations 366 384 Fair value of plan assets 401 391 Surplus 35 7 Unrecognised actuarial losses 56 61 Unrecognised past service cost 1 Net pension asset in the Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 91 69 Additional information regarding the actuarial valuation and changes in plan assets and liabilities has been included in the Additional Financial Information Note 15.
Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.
This is also the amount of regulatory capital we hold under Pillar 2 in respect of the pension plans.
