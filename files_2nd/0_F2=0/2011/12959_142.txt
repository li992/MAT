The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of inflation and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 2.5% 2010: 3.5% per annum, being an estimate derived from the risk free rate.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali and in Cte dIvoire to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Life of Mine LOM plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the LOM which is 2027 for Loulo, 2021 for Tongon, 2021 for Gounkoto and currently 2021 for Morila.
The Morila rehabilitation estimate at 31 December 2011 includes the impact of the approved tailings storage facility retreatment programme, where the retreated tailings will be disposed in the pit, reducing closure cost and the risk of closing the surface tailings storage facility.
