Section 5 | Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with below.
Revenue and profit recognition of long-term project-based contracts Revenue and profit is recognised for certain long-term project-based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by the proportion of costs incurred to estimated whole-life contract costs.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values see note 13.
The carrying value of goodwill is 1,259.0m 2010: 899.5m at the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefit obligations The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates see note 27.
The value of net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 156.4m 2010: 226.2m.
Details of the impact of changes in assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations are disclosed in the Finance Review page 54. Business combinations The calculation of fair values associated with business combinations requires the use of judgement in determining the future economic inflows and outflows associated with the acquired assets and liabilities.
This includes the estimation of contingent deferred consideration and intangibles arising on acquisition.
As permitted by IFRS 3 2008, provisional amounts are recognised for acquired net assets during the measurement period where complete information about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date is not available at the reporting date.
