47 Financial instruments The Companys risk management policies and procedures are integrated with the wider Rathbone Groups risk management process.
The Rathbone Group has identified the risks arising from all of its activities, including those of the Company, and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite.
The Company categorises its financial risks into three areas: i credit risk: ii liquidity risk: and iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk.
The sections below outline the Group risk appetite, as applicable to the Company, and explain how the Company defines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Companys risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks that the Company faces, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The Company regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business and the wider industry.
The Companys overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the Board of directors the Board.
The Board has embedded risk management within the business through the executive committee and senior management.
i Credit risk The Company takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its trading activities.
The principal sources of credit risk arise from depositing funds with banks and through providing long term and working capital financing for subsidiaries.
The Company also took on credit exposure through the provision of loans as part of the disposal of its subsidiaries in Jersey and Switzerland in 2008 and 2009.
The Company places surplus funds with its banking subsidiary, which operates under the Groups credit risk management policies.
Group policy requires that funds are placed with a range of high-quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
For the purposes of financial reporting the Company categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Cash equivalents balances at banks The Company has exposure to financial institutions through its bank deposits reported within cash equivalents.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of the Companys own reserves.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables relate to amounts placed with subsidiaries and loans provided to subsidiaries and former subsidiaries.
The collection and ageing of trade and other receivables are reviewed on a periodic basis by management.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.

Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.
No impairment losses arose during the year 2010: none.
