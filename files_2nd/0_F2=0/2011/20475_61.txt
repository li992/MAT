Financial assets and liabilities The Groups financial instruments can be analysed as follows: 31December 31December 2011 2010 m m Financial assets: Investments held at fair value 862.1 363.6 Held to maturity deposits with credit institutions 297.0 299.6 Receivables amounts owed by policyholders 423.9 341.5 Total financial assets per consolidated balance sheet 1,583.0 1,004.7 Trade and other receivables 52.1 47.9 Cash and cash equivalents 224.6 246.7 1,859.7 1,299.3 Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 856.6 561.0 All investments held at fair value are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds.
These funds target a short term cash return with capital security and low volatility and continue to achieve these goals.
The approximate fair value of held to maturity deposits is 280.8m 2010: 285.2m based on a calculation to discount expected cashflows arising at the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011 is as follows: Between On demand 1 Year 1 and 2 years 2 Years m m m m Financial assets: Investments held at fair value 862.1 Held to maturity deposits with credit institutions 175.3 79.2 42.5 Receivables amounts owed by policyholders 423.9 Total financial assets 862.1 599.2 79.2 42.5 Trade and other receivables 52.1 Cash and cash equivalents 224.6 1,086,7 651.3 79.2 42.5 Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 856.6 The maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2010 was as follows: Between On demand 1 Year 1 and 2 years 2 Years m m m m Financial assets: Investments held at fair value 363.6 Held to maturity deposits with credit institutions 197.3 60.8 41.5 Receivables amounts owed by policyholders 341.5 Total financial assets 363.6 538.8 60.8 41.5 Trade and other receivables 47.9 Cash and cash equivalents 246.7 610.3 586.760.8 41.5 Financial liabilities: Trade and other payables 561.0 Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2011 70 Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities: The Groups activities expose it primarily to the significant financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit risk: The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations or fails to perform them in a timely fashion.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite, and no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of specified financial strength ratings.
In addition, most reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous high and low level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2011 is 1,807.6m 2010: 1,251.4m being the carrying value of financial assets and cash.
The group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2010 and 2011 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2011 or 2010.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31December 31December 2011 2010 Rating m m Financial institutions Money market funds AAA 862.1 363.6 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 178.2 252.6 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 98.0 47.0 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB 20.8 Reinsurers A 88.3 104.4 Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2011 71 Notes to the financial statements continued Interest rate risk: The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
This relates primarily to investments held at fair value.
As noted above, the Group invests in money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates as longer duration fixed income portfolios can experience.
Returns are likely to closely track the LIBID benchmark and hence while the Groups investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value of these investment funds will not be impacted by rate movements.
The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal.
The Group also holds a number of fixed rate, longer-term deposits with UK credit institutions.
These are classified as held to maturity and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, or the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available, financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments are immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups financial liabilities trade and other payables is shown in note 21.
In terms of the maturity profile of these liabilities, all amounts will mature within 3 6 months of the balance sheet date except for a minority of finance lease liabilities which will expire after 12 months.
Refer to note 22 and the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cashflows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to coinsurers and reinsurers of 579.4m 2010: 327.4m, 432.9m 2010: 213.8m is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 18.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cashflows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore considered to be significant.
Foreign exchange risks: Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its expanding operations overseas.
Although the relative size of the European and International operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities, however surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
Fair value: For cash at bank and cash deposits, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
For assets held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level 1 quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy specified in the amendment to IFRS 7.
