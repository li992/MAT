Principal accounting policies Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical Bar plc the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings together the Group drawn up to 31 March 2011.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities over which the Group has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies through the exercise of voting rights.
Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Groups share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Groups share of the Joint Ventures net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Companys cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant inuence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Going concern The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Financial Review on pages 36 to 38.
Revenue recognition Rental income - rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Any incentive for lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods - assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts for the sale of the site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion.
Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts - where an asset is constructed under a specic contract with a purchaser a pre-sold development the initial sale of the site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
The construction element of the contract is treated, for the purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to project appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certicates provided by quantity surveyors.
The Companys principal other responsibility on pre-sold developments is the identication of and agreement of terms with potential tenants of the completed building s. The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements is considered separately to reect the substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
The amount of revenue recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the building s that are let.
Investment income - revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration received receivable on investments held for the short-term.
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment has been established.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Share-based payments The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan.
These payments are discussed in greater detail in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 54.
The fair value of share-based payments related to employees service are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date.
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group uses the stochastic valuation model and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement Income Statement over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties.
The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies.
Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the Groups head ofce at 11-15 Farm Street, London W1J 5RS are capitalised and held as short-term leasehold improvements.
Leasehold improvements, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Short leasehold improvements 10% or length of lease, if shorter Plant and equipment 25% page 66 Helical Bar plc 2011 notes to the financial statements Taxation The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reects the tax consequences of the manner in which Helical expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: a the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference: and, b it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value.
These fair values are based on market values as determined by professionally qualied external valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on their knowledge of the property.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassied.
Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 16.
Goodwill Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after acquisition in the Income Statement.
Land, developments and trading properties Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the date of commencement of the development work until date of practical completion.
Investments Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the Income Statement.
Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the Income Statement.
notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc 2011 page 67 Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost.
For the purposes of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs yet to be amortised.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of new developments and investment properties are added to the costs of such properties until the date of completion of the development or investment.
After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
This treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and oors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks arising from its activities.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash ows and forward rates as appropriate.
Any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be found in note 23.
Leases Leases are classied according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classied as a finance lease.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant nancing rate.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate.
The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to retained earnings in equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges are transferred to the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Net asset values per share Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
Earnings loss per share Earnings loss per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds.
Assets, liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the statutory headings to which they relate.
Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease the book value of Own shares held in the Balance Sheet.
At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the fair value of Own shares held and accounts for movement between book value and fair value as a reserves transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial accounts.
These estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
page 68 Helical Bar plc 2011 notes to the financial statements Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may signicantly impact on the Groups earnings and financial position are: revenue on construction contracts where the valuation is spread over the construction period using estimates of the final outcome note 3 : valuation of investment properties, where external valuers are used to provide third party valuations note 16 : recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the end of the performance periods note 31 : calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered note 12 : valuation of the investment in Quotient Bioscience Group Limited, which is based on a valuation method note 19 : valuation of the investment in a property developer which is based on a valuation method note 19 : and, directors valuation of land, development and trading properties include subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions and future sales values and timings note 22.
Segmental information IFRS 8 requires the identication of the Groups operating segments which are dened as being discrete components of the Groups operations whose results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker being the Chief Executive to allocate resources to those segments and to assess their performance.
The Group divides its business into the following segments: s NVESTMENTPROPERTIES    owned or leased with the intention to sell: and, s$EVELOPMENTPROPERTIES WHICHINCLUDESITES   SOLD developments.

Taxation on loss on ordinary activities Year ended Year ended 31.3.
10 000 000 The tax credit is based on the loss profit for the year and represents: United Kingdom corporation tax at 28% Group corporation tax adjustment in respect of prior periods 1,152 overseas tax 97 Current tax charge credit 97 1,152 Deferred tax at 26% capital allowances 442 52 tax losses 1,823 2,121 other temporary differences 223 1,510 Deferred tax credit 2,488 559 Tax credit on loss profit on ordinary activities 2,391 1,711 Factors affecting the tax credit for the period: The tax assessed for the period is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 28%.

Accordingly, the tax reconciliation also uses this rate of corporation tax.
page 72 Helical Bar plc 2011 notes to the financial statements Factors that may affect future tax charges The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in respect of eligible expenditure on investment properties and unrealised capital losses at 31 March 2011 of 12m.
Deferred tax Deferred tax provided for in the financial statements is set out below: Group Group Company Company 31.3.
10 000 000 000 000 Capital allowances 2,815 3,257 29 228 Available-for-sale assets 4,782 3,222 Tax losses 9,527 7,704 168 Other temporary differences 2,167 3,504 746 Deferred tax asset liability 8,879 3,169 717 3,282 Other temporary differences represent deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments and future tax relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of 2.8m 2010: 3.3m would be released and further capital allowances of 10.6m 2010: 12.2m would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

The final dividend, if approved at the AGM on 26 July 2011, will be paid on 28 July 2011 to shareholders on the register on 1 July 2011.
This final dividend, amounting to 3,213,000, has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2011, in accordance with IFRS.
Parent company The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income statement in the financial statements.
The loss for the year of the Company was 4,592,000 2010: profit of 3,975,000.
Earnings per share The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end.
Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the issue of shares on the assumed exercise of all dilutive options.
The loss earnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share and the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc 2011 page 73 Reconciliations of the loss earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Accordingly, the basic and diluted losses per share for that year are the same.
The loss used for calculation of diluted EPRA earnings per share includes net rental income and development property profits losses but excludes trading property losses.

Available-for-sale investments Non-Current Non-Current Current Current Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2010 13,325 13,325 10,959 Impairment in the year 13,325 13,325 Interest receivable 207 Fair value adjustments 661 At 31 March 2011 10,505 Included in non-current available-for-sale investments is an investment of 18% in the ordinary shares of Quotient Biosciences Group Limited, a private bioscience company.
At 31 March 2010 the valuation of the investment in Quotient was derived using a valuation technique as there was no active market for the shares.
During the year trading conditions and its financial position deteriorated and, accordingly, the investment has been assessed as having a fair value of nil 31 March 2010: 13.3m.
Of the fall in value, 1,817,000, representing the cost of our investment, has been written off through the Income Statement as Impairment of available-for-sale investments.
The remaining 11,508,000 8,286,000 net of deferred tax, which represents prior period fair-value increases from cost, was reversed in Other Comprehensive Income.
Included within current available-for-sale investments is an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development and an investment of 20% of the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are classed as available-for-sale investments and are held at fair value.
The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the loan and the equity element separately.
The loan element is valued at the fair value of the consideration receivable.
The equity element is given a nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome.
This nil valuation is derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the companys assets, after the repayment of the loan payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
Of the movement in the fair value of the loan and equity and the associated deferred tax movement, loan interest, calculated using the effective interest method, of 207,000 has been recognised in the Income Statement as interest receivable and 661,000 of other fair value movement has been recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.
Movements in the Statement of Comprehensive Income comprise: 2011 2010 000 000 Fair value movements of available-for-sale investments 661 2,962 Impairment movements of available-for-sale investments 11,508 12,169 2,962 Deferred tax on fair value movements 829 Deferred tax on impairments 3,222 3,222 829 20.

The results and financial position of Barts Two Investment Property Limited at the balance sheet date have been accounted for as a joint venture.
Following the purchase of Barts in the year, the joint venture company has a contingent liability to pay up to a further 35m which will be dependent upon the timing of vacant possession and the oor area of any future redevelopment scheme for which planning permission is received.
The meeting of the conditions in which an extra payment is required will almost certainly result in an increase in the valuation of the property equal to or above the amount of the additional payment.

Financial liabilities are stated in accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and oors.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps, caps and oors are measured at the present value of future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
IFRS 7 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels: Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: values are derived from observing market data Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data The derivative financial instruments above have been valued using a Level 2 methodology and the available-for-sale investments, which are described in note 19, are classied as Level 3 fair value measurements, being those not based on observable market data.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.

Credit risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial position, past experience and other factors.
As at 31 March 2011 Helical has total credit risk excluding cash of 46.5m of which 10.5m is available-for-sale assets and 36.0m is loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 19.
Of the trade receivables held at 31 March 2011, two amounts of 8.2m and 3.9m were due from the sale of investment properties and were both received on 1 April 2011 and a further 1.6m related to rent due from tenants which was received post year-end.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables, see note 24.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is dened as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
Helical manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain exibility.
Management monitors the Groups net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash ows.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on borrowing facilities, see notes 27 and 28.
The maturity prole of the Groups contracted financial liabilities is as follows: Group Group Company Company 31.3.
The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date.
The management believe that these facilities, together with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that Helical can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market risk Helical is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments and accrued development profits.
The Group actively monitors these exposures.
notes to the financial statements Helical Bar plc 2011 page 81 Interest rate risk It is the Groups policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash ow exposures on long-term nancing.
Helical does this by using a number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of nancing and financial instruments can be found in note 28.
In the year to 31 March 2011, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to pre-tax losses and equity due to movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, Helical has exposure to exchange movements on foreign currencies.
Helicals management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to minimise these risks.
Helical has entered into currency option contracts in order to reduce its exposure to these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2011 the Group made foreign exchange losses of 67,000 resulting from foreign exchange movements related to its Polish operations.
The Groups balance sheet translation exposure is summarised as follows: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Euro Zloty US dollars Euro Zloty US dollars 000 000 000 000 000 000 Gross currency assets 51,428 6,338 10,492 48,387 11,508 10,946 Gross currency liabilities 22,339 5,411 25,399 3,826 Net exposure 29,089 927 10,492 22,988 7,682 10,946 The group has entered into a fair-value hedge to reduce the effects of foreign exchange translation losses on stock.
Any movement in the fair value of this instrument is shown in the Income Statement as part of the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The Companys balance sheet translation exposure is almost exclusively due to intra-group loans and is summarised as follows: 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 Euro Zloty Euro Zloty 000 000 000 000 Gross currency assets 2,550 17,247 4,025 14,955 Gross currency liabilities Net exposure 2,550 17,247 4,025 14,955 The Groups main currency exposure is to the euro.

The sensitivity of the net assets and profit of the Company to a 10% change in the value of the foreign currencies against sterling is Euro: 255,000 March 2010: 402,000, Zloty: 1,725,000 March 2010: 1,496,000.
In addition to the above the Group has entered in to a number of currency option contracts to act as cashow hedges against development contracts in Poland and future expected profits on the development schemes.
Whilst these contracts are designed to minimise foreign exchange risk on these transactions, hedge accounting has not been applied and any movement to the fair value of the options is shown in the Income Statement as part of the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
