Authorisation of financial statements The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2012 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominique Yates.
Regus plc S. A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company prepares its parent company financial statements in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP: extracts from these are presented on page 88.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities.
The extract from the parent company financial statements presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC with an effective date from 1 January 2011 did not have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
IAS 24 Related Party transactions Amendment clarifies the definitions of a related party.
The new definitions emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships as well as clarifying in which circumstances persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity.
The amendment also introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with a government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the reporting entity.
The adoption of this amendment has no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation Amendment alters the definition of a financial liability in IAS 32 to enable entities to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments.
The amendment is applicable if the rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entitys non-derivative equity instruments, to acquire a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency.
IFRIC 14 Prepayment of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment removes an unintended consequence when an entity is subject to minimum funding requirements and makes an early payment of contributions to cover such requirements.
The amendment permits a prepayment of future service cost by the entity to be recognised as a pension asset.
The amendment to the interpretation has no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
Improvements to IFRSs issued in May 2010 : the International Accounting Standards Board issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
The following interpretation and amendments to interpretations did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group: x IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes x IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 33.
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements on pages 40 to 87. www.
com investors 45 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Accounting policies continued In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered the further information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 5 to 11 as well as the Groups principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 26 and 27.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 24 to the notes to the accounts on page 68.
These Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is Regus plcs functional currency, and all values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or the associate qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group.
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date.
The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value.
The effect of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc.
At the date of the transaction, Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group plc.
Consequently no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
IFRSs not yet effective The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements as they are effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation introduces amendments to improve the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income.
This statement is effective for years beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendment introduces a rebuttable assumption that deferred tax on investment properties measured at fair value will be recognised on a sale basis, unless an entity has a business model that would indicate the investment property will be consumed in business.
This statement is effective for years beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments Disclosures Amendment requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures relating to the transfer of assets, when financial assets are derecognised in their entirety, but the entity has a continuing involvement in them, and when financial assets are not derecognised in their entirety.
These amendments are effective for years beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities as defined in IAS 39.
This statement will be effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements by changing whether an entity is consolidated by revising the definition of control.
The statement also provided a number of clarifications on applying this new definition of control.
This statement will be effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements established principles for the financial reporting by parties to a joint arrangement.
Joint control is defined as the contractually agreed sharing on control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities combines, enhances and replaces the disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associated and unconsolidated structured entities.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement establishes a single source of guidance for all fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted.
The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early adoption and relevant to the Group.
The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become effective.
46 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2011 and updated at 31 December 2011.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition over the share of the fair value of identifiable assets including intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate, asset deal acquisition or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Positive goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Groups transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the requirements of IFRS.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Brand Regus brand Indefinite life Brand Other acquired brands 20 years Computer software 3 5 years Customer lists 1 2 years Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result.
Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.

Accounting policies continued Leases Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
All other leases, including all of the Groups property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors, net of any future finance charges.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating leases Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments.
The commencement of the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments.
Contingent rentals are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Exceptional Items Exceptional items are those items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Buildings 20 years Fixtures and fittings Over the shorter of the lease term and 10 years Furniture 10 years Office equipment and telephones 5 10 years Motor vehicles 4 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Revenue Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding sales taxes.
Where rent free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the customer contract.
Workstations Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered.
Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income Service income including the rental of meeting rooms is recognised as services are rendered.
In circumstances where Regus acts as an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered.
Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.
Membership card income Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card are expected to be provided.
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned from the provision of global workplace solutions.
Employee benefits The Groups major pension plans are of the defined contribution type.
For these plans the Groups contribution and other paid and unpaid benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred.
48 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 For the defined benefit obligation plans, the employers portion of past and current services cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within other finance costs.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full, directly in other comprehensive income such that the balance sheet reflects the plans deficits as at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future.
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases.
Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate.
In determining this discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds in the respective currency with at least AA rating, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables for the specific country.
Future salary increases and pension increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective country.
Further details about the assumptions used are given in note 26.
Share-based payments The share option programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company: these awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights CIP are also granted by the Company to certain employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is initially recognised at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan which awards entitlements to certain employees and Directors of the Group.
These entitlements are convertible into options over ordinary shares subject to the Groups share price reaching certain targets.
The fair value is initially recognised at the date of the award of the entitlements and spread over the period during which the entitlements are convertible into ordinary shares.
The fair value of the entitlements is based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
Taxation Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
com investors 49 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Net finance expenses Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a prepayment and recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying value of the financial liability and charged to the interest expense using the effective interest rate method.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Costs arising on bank guarantees & letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses have been classified separately as other finance costs in the income statement.
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition.
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition would be immaterial.
Liquid investments consist of held to maturity bonds and deposits.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The results and cash flows of overseas operations are translated using the average rate for the period.
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of foreign operations are translated using the closing rate with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.
Exchange differences are released to the income statement on disposal.
Under the transition requirements of IFRS, cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2004.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 24.
Derivative financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.
Segmental analysis statutory basis An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including those that relate to transactions with other operating segments.
An operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker the Board of Directors of the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas: Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA : Asia Pacific: and the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom segment does not include the Groups non-trading holding and corporate management companies that are based in the UK and the EMEA segment does not include the Groups non-trading head office and holding companies that are based in Luxembourg and Switzerland.
The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker.
All reportable segments are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions.
The Groups reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic characteristics that exist in each of those markets.
Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible for the performance of the segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc for the year ended 31 December 2010.
The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit which excludes certain nonrecurring items including provisions for onerous contracts and asset write-downs, exceptional gains and losses, internal management charges and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other operating segments.
Revenue from internal customers is determined by reference to current market prices.

Segmental analysis entity-wide disclosures The Groups primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions and therefore all revenue is attributed to a single group of similar products and services.
It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products.
Revenue is recognised where the service is provided.
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.

Deferred tax assets recognised on short term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and share based payments.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast taxable profits in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 51.3 million 2010: 64.3 million.
The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these CGUs.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 171.3 168.8 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 5.9 6.6 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 11.9 11.1 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 96.3 95.9 285.4 282.4 The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total carrying value comprising 87% of the total.
The remaining 13% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 24 countries 24 cash generating units.
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units are set out below: Intangible Goodwill assets 2011 2010 m m m m USA 149.5 149.5 148.1 UK 96.3 11.2 107.5 107.1 Other cash generating units 39.6 39.6 38.4 285.4 11.2 296.6 293.6 The indefinite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 14.
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash flows attributable to the unit.
The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group.
Management believe that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term.
In the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
60 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of CGUs: x Future cash flows are based on budget for 2012 approved by the Board.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2013 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3-5.6% 2010: 3-5.4%.
x These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.
Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position reflecting the current uncertain global economic conditions.
Cash flows beyond 2016 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believe is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses.
x The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each CGU.
The country specific discount rate is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
The Group WACC is then adjusted for each CGU to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country.
The market risk adjustments remain unchanged from 2010 giving a risk adjusted range of 13% to 19% 2010: 12% to 17%.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Current market conditions remain challenging for the Group and the current global conditions make forecasting medium-term cash flows more difficult than is traditionally the case.
The forecast cash flows used to derive the value in use are sensitive to changes in revenues driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both, costs and discount rates including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reflected in the Groups market capitalisation.
Actual conditions could result in either better or worse cash flows than included in the value in use calculation.
Should current economic conditions prove to be more prolonged or to deteriorate greater than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash flows and could result in impairments to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods.
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the CGUs are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the CGUs.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the cash-generating units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount.
The key assumptions used in the US model are that in 2012 the forecast centre contribution rises to 29% from 24%.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2011 maintaining a terminal 2016 centre gross margin of 29%.
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 2010:12%.
The UK model assumes an ongoing recovery reverting to mid-cycle revenue and occupancy being achieved in 2016 prior to the application of the long-run growth rate and discount rates used.
This model forecasts a 2012 centre contribution of 13%, rising to 22%, before reverting to a mid-cycle centre contribution of 16%.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13% 2010:12%.
Management has considered the following sensitivities: Market growth and WIPOW Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW.
The value in use calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK CGUs would still be greater than their carrying value.
Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value-in-use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased to 25% for the US CGU and 17% for the UK CGU.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.

The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 13.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis.
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
Going concern The Business Review on pages 5 to 11 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 16 to 19 within the Business Review reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group.
A feature of the Group has been its strong cash flows, and during the year ended 31 December 2011, while making significant investment in growth, the Group has maintained its cash levels at comparable levels to the position at the start of the financial year.
While many countries where the Group operates continue to experience difficult economic conditions, the Directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions to strengthen the current market leading position of the Group.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts, which contribute the majority of the Groups revenue, minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.

2011 2010 m m Americas 21.9 18.9 EMEA 41.7 42.9 Asia Pacific 17.5 16.6 UK 24.6 24.2 105.7 102.6 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Not overdue 98.0 94.3 0.6 Past due 0 30 days 4.9 0.2 6.6 0.3 Past due 31 60 days 2.2 0.2 2.3 0.4 More than 60 days 12.4 11.4 11.2 10.5 117.5 11.8 114.4 11.8 At the year end 31 December 2011, the Group maintained a provision of 11.8 million against potential bad debts 2010: 11.8 million arising from trade receivables.
The Group had provided 5.1 million 2010: 4.1 million in the year and utilised 5.0 million 2010: 7.0 million.
Customer deposits of 184.3 million 2010: 163.2 million are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 172.0 million 2010: 172.0 million which the Directors consider adequate to meet the Groups day to day requirements.
The three year unsecured Bank Guarantee & Letter of Credit facility, entered into in November 2010 with Lloyds TSB bank, was increased to 100 million in the current year.
The facility is subject to financial covenants covering operating cash flows, the ratio of Gross Debt to consolidated tangible net worth and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental charges.
The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of 102.2 million 2010: 75.2 million, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
Although the Group holds customer deposits of 184.3 million 2010: 163.2 million these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current assets, excluding deferred income, were 39.5 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 50.6 million.
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reflects the future non-refundable contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in future periods.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the market value of our investments in financial assets.
These exposures are actively managed by the Regus treasury in accordance with a written policy approved by the Board of Directors and subject to internal controls.
We do not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons.
Interest rate risk The Group manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt, as well as investment in financial assets.
Our surplus cash balances are invested short term, and at the end of 2011 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.
The Board of Directors believes that the Group has no material exposure to interest rate fluctuations as the Group does not have any significant interest bearing loans or long-term financial investments.
Foreign currency risk The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in GBP.
As a consequence the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency and the underlying exposure is small.
Transactional exposures do arise in some countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of the affiliate.
Intercompany charging, funding and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures.
It is the policy of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement.
Net investments in Regus affiliates with a functional currency other than GBP are of a long-term nature and we do not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures.
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
In the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group used derivative financial instruments to manage the translation risk of certain foreign currencies on the reported profits of the Group.
As of 31 December 2011 all such instruments had matured.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the income statement.
Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Chief Financial Officer monitors the diversity of the Groups major shareholders and further details of the Groups communication with key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 24 to 30.
In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Groups Chief Executive Officer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board hold shares in the Company.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 32 to 38.
In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital in the market.
In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under the Groups share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2011 Regus plc purchased 1,212,797 2010: 1,353,188 of its own shares in the open market and utilised these to satisfy employee share awards.
Regus plc did not re-purchase any of its own shares in the open market to hold as treasury shares.
As at 20 March 2012, 9,070,906 shares were held as treasury shares.
The Company declared an interim dividend of 0.9p per share 2010: 0.85p during the year ended 31 December 2011 and proposed a final dividend of 2.0p per share 2010: 1.75p per share, a 12% increase on the 2010 dividend.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group holds minimal debt and is in a strong cash position therefore it is majority equity funded.
The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position as well as the strategy of accelerated organic growth.
Effective interest rates In respect of financial assets and financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature.

It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: 0.4 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 7.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: 7.9 million.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pounds sterling would have increased the Groups total equity by approximately 0.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: 0.6 million.

Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

Performance conditions for share options The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest.
The share options vested based on the basic earnings per share adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index.
The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p.
100% of the options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.
The awards of options made in March 2008 failed to meet the related performance conditions and lapsed in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The options awarded in April, June and September 2010 contain the following performance conditions.
50% of the options will be eligible to vest if the Regus Total Shareholder Return TSR % achieved relative to FTSE All Share Total Return index is at least at the median over the performance period.

A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards was updated in the year ended 31 December 2010 c The LTIP Awards of 3 November 2005 had a release date of 3 November 2008.

The LTIP nil cost options had a vesting date of 3 November 2008 and an expiry date of 3 November 2015.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments are currently anticipated: x In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
Thus it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
x Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
x It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
x The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash flow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.

Share-based payment continued As indicated in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee felt it inappropriate to set specific performance conditions for Matching Shares under the CIP and options awards under the Share Option Plan awarded in March 2008 and March 2009 but were committed to carrying out a thorough review of the matter during 2009.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the following modifications will be made to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following performance conditions will apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010.
The total number of awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant will be divided into three separate equal amounts and will be subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively.
Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount will not vest until March 2013, the second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not vest until March 2015.
These vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively.
The vesting of these awards will be subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets.
75% of each of the three amounts will be subject to defined earnings per share EPS targets over the respective performance periods.
The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total shareholder return TSR targets over the respective periods.
The targets will be as follows: EPS targets for the financial years ending % of awards eligible for vesting 2012 2013 2014 25% 15p 17p 18p 50% 16p 20p 22p 75% 17p 23p 26p 100% 18p 26p 30p No shares will vest in each respective year unless the minimum EPS target for that year is achieved.

Share-based payment continued Where the share price targets have not been met by 31 March 2013 then the VCP Entitlement will not convert, no ordinary shares will be earned and no VCP Options will be granted under the VCP.

Retirement Benefit Obligations In 2011 for the first time, the Group has accounted for the Swiss pension plans as defined benefit plans under IAS 19 based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method of the multi-employer plan assets to the Groups interest in the plans.
Given that the IAS 19 valuation resulted in insignificant prior year net liabilities, the management of the Group believes that it is appropriate not to restate 2010 comparatives.
The Group has recognised 0.4m of pension costs in the income statement, together with a loss of 0.1m in other comprehensive income.
Reconciliation of balance sheet movements The reconciliation of assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: m 31.12.2011 31.12.2010 Fair value of plan assets 2.4 1.1 Present value of obligations 2.5 1.1 Net funded obligations 0.1 As required by IAS 19 liabilities for benefit obligations are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
The Group does not operate any unfunded defined benefit pension plans.
Changes in present value of defined benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets: Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: m 31.12.2011 At 1 January 1.1 Current service costs 0.4 Plan participants contributions 0.3 Benefit payments 0.8 Interest cost Net Insurance Premiums and expenses 0.2 Actuarial gain loss for the year 0.1 Exchange rate differences At 31 December 2.5 Changes in the fair value of plan assets were as follows: m 31.12.2011 At 1 January 1.1 Employer contributions 0.4 Plan participants contributions 0.3 Benefit payments 0.8 Expected return on plan assets Actuarial gain loss for the year Net Insurance Premiums and expenses 0.2 Exchange rate differences At 31 December 2.4 80 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Income and expenses The amounts that have been recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2011 are as follows: m 31.12.2011 Analysis of amounts charged credited to the income statement: Service cost component net of plan participants contributions 0.4 Interest cost component Expected return on plan assets Total charge credit to operating profit 0.4 Analysis of amounts recognised in other comprehensive income: Net actuarial gains losses recognised 0.1 Actuarial gain loss 0.1 Current service costs have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Interest costs and expected return on plan assets have been included in finance expenses.
The actual return on plan assets was nil 2010: nil.
Major assumptions The major assumptions, adopted by the Group, when valuing the defined benefit obligations under IAS 19 are as follows: 31.12.11 01.01.11 Discount rate 2.25% 2.80% Inflation rate 1.00% 1.00% Expected return on plan assets 2.25% 2.80% Future salary increase 1.00% 1.00% Future pension increase 0.00% 0.00% Average remaining years of service life 10.9 10.8 Life expectancy is reflected in the defined benefit obligations by using up-to-date mortality tables.
The mortality and invalidity assumptions, adopted by the Group, are based on the LPP 2010 tables as follows: Life expectancy Mortality tables at age 65 2011 LPP 2010 Male 19.56 Female 21.89 Analysis of scheme assets The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 31.12.11 01.01.11 Money market 4.3% 4.3% Fixed income 75.3% 75.3% Equity 0.6% 0.6% Real Estate 12.4% 12.4% Other 7.4% 7.4% Total 100% 100% Sensitivities An increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit obligation by 3.0%.
A decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate would increase the defined benefit obligation by 4.3%.

Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtain third party valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2011, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 13.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur and can be reliably estimated.
