The groups unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2011 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 Income Taxes the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2011 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances.
The corporate model used to assess whether additional deferred tax assets should be recognised was re-run, taking into account additional equity acquired in the Wytch Farm and Catcher areas and the inclusion of other additional UK fields, using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and US$75 bbl in real terms thereafter.
As a result, the remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets of US$70.2 million have been recognised in 2011.
At 31 December 2011, the group UK ring fence deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and allowances have been recognised in full.
