The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit loss before tax is as follows: 2010 11 2009 10 m m Tax on profit loss at UK corporation tax rate of 28% 28% 39 26 Effect of overseas tax rates 1 1 Effect of disallowed expenditure 3 12 Movement in unrecognised temporary differences 41 14 Recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets 81 96 Effect of change in tax rate from 28% to 26% 11 Adjustments relating to prior years 1 Tax credit 69 95 The main rate of corporation tax in the UK was reduced from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
This change, announced in the Budget on 23 March 2011, was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 following the conclusion of the Budget debates.
This change is reflected in the measurement of deferred tax balances and the quantum of the deferred tax credit in these financial statements.
In addition to the change in the rate of corporation tax disclosed above, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further changes were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not reflected in these financial statements.
The effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 25%, expected to take effect from 1 April 2012, if applied to the measurement of deferred tax asset balances at the balance sheet date would be to reduce the deferred tax asset recognised at the balance sheet date by 8 million.
This decrease in the recognised deferred tax asset would be reflected in the income statement.
The proposed reductions of the rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if applied to the measurement of deferred tax asset balances at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the asset by 17 million being 9 million recognised in 2013 and 8 million recognised in 2014.
