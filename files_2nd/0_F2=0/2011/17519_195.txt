There have been no cancellations or modifications to any of the plans during 2011 or 2010.
Xstrata plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP has two elements: i A contingent award of free ordinary shares that vests after three years, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied: and ii An option to acquire ordinary shares at a specified exercise price after the third anniversary of grant, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied.
All LTIP awards that vest are subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria being met over a three-year performance period.
The 2003 LTIP awards are only subject to the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance criteria.
Half of the options and free share awards granted in 2004 and 2005 are conditional on TSR relative to a peer group, with the remainder conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale over the three-year period.
Options and free share awards made to corporate employees in 2006, 2007 and 2008 were granted on the same basis as in 2004 and 2005.
75% of options and free shares awarded to business unit employees in 2006, 2007 and 2008 are conditional on achieving real cost savings and the remaining 25% are conditional on TSR performance criteria.
The allocation of performance criteria pertaining to the options and free share awards granted in 2010 and 2011 is summarised in the following table: | Xstrata | Annual Report 2011 | www.
com Notes to the financial statements continued 166 34.
No vesting will occur for below median performance.
For the awards where vesting is conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale: 10% of the award will vest for 1% cost savings, 70% for 2% cost savings and all awards for 3% or more cost savings, with straight-line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur if cost savings are less than 1%.
Real cost savings are measured in relation to operating costs after adjusting for the effects of inflation, excluding depreciation, commodity priceDeferred bonus linked costs, effects of currencies on translation of local currency costs, and planned life-of-mine adjustments.
No other features of the LTIP awards are incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
No consideration will be payable on the vesting of an LTIP award of free ordinary shares.
On exercise of an option, a participant will be required to pay an exercise price that is based on the closing market price of an ordinary share seven trading days prior to the date of grant.
Of the options listed below, 6.4 million 2010: 5.5 million are accounted for as cash-settled share-based awards whilst the remainder of the LTIP awards are equity-settled.

The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historic volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Both the free shares and the equity-settled options are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value of the cash-settled options is measured at the date of grant and at each reporting date until the liability is settled, using binomial models, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award.
At 31 December 2011 the provision held for cash settled awards was US$42 million 2010 US$70 million refer to note 31.
Deferred bonus As detailed within the Directors Remuneration report on pages 96 to 109, the maximum bonus payable under the bonus plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee is 300% of salary.
Bonuses are payable in three tranches as follows: the maximum bonus, which any one participant is eligible to receive in cash, will be limited to 100% of the individuals base salary: any additional bonus up to a further 100% of base salary will be deferred for a period of one year: and any remaining bonus will be deferred for a period of two years.
The deferred elements will take the form of awards of Xstrata shares conditional on the participant remaining in employment throughout the deferral period.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date concurrent awards under the LTIP are made.
The Free shares deferred elements have been treated as an equity-settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2.
2011 Number During the bonus deferral period dividend equivalents accrue and are delivered at the end of the deferral period, subject to the deferral award vesting.
14,264,247 As dividend equivalents are receivable on the deferred amounts, the fair value of the deferral is technically equal to the value of the bonuses deferred.

Performance is assessed over periods of three years and five years from the grant date of each cycle and is based upon the growth in the Companys TSR over the relevant performance period relative to an index of global mining companies, which form the Xstrata TSR Index.
A description of the performance requirements and the vesting schedule of the plan are detailed within the Directors Remuneration report on Share options pages 96 to 109.
The first cycle of the AVP began in 2005 and has occurred annually until 2009.
There was no 2010 AVP and no further awards will be granted.
2011 2011 Number WAEP For the 2009 plan cycle, the market capitalisation on 17 April 2009 was US$21.7 billion, the participation percentage was equal to 0.3% and the share price at the measurement date was US$8.73 post rights issue.
For the 2008 plan cycle, the market capitalisation on 26 March 2008 was US$76.4 billion, the 59,015,377 GBP7.31 participation percentage was equal to 0.5% and the share price at the measurement date was US$70.50.
For the 2007 plan cycle, the market capitalisation on 9,472,888 GBP14.68 15 March 2007 was US$45.2 billion, the participation percentage was equal to 0.3% and the share price at the measurement date was US$46.77.

Employee benefits continued The fair value of all awards, which are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments to reflect the expected form of settlement, has been estimated in accordance with IFRS 2 using a Monte Carlo simulation model to incorporate the market-based features of the plan.
The following table presents the fair value of each cycle of the award at grant date and the value of the unvested portion of each cycle if conditions that existed at 31 December 2011 are those at the time of vesting.
Value of unvested award based Estimated Plan cycle on conditions at 31 December fair value Grant date at grant date 2011 2010 US$m Pension Post-Retirement 2009 17 Apr 2009 135 32 87 plans medical plans 2011 2011 This amount represents the value of the award if it had vested as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
3.3% In accordance with IFRS 2 as it applies to cash-settled share-based payments, a provision was recognised based on the fair value of each cycle adjusted for the 1.9% vesting period yet to lapse.
This model determined the fair value of each cycle at 31 December 2011 to estimate the final performance of the Group and its performance relative to its peers.
Any ultimate payments may vary significantly from the estimated fair values determined at 31 December 2011 as a result of differences between the estimated outcomes determined by the simulation model and the actual outcomes.
At 31 December 2011, the total provision held for 7.3% the AVP was US$44 million 2010 US$167 million representing the 2009 plan refer to note 31.
There were no 2010 and 2011 AVP awards.
The decrease in 4.0% the provision during the year reflects the comparative rate of performance of the Company in the 2011 year against the peer group, to which the design of the 5.1% plan gives additional weighting when that group itself is rising.
The ultimate value of each cycle will reflect its intrinsic value at the date of vesting which 4.3% 4.6% depends on relative outperformance over the cycle as a whole.

plans medical plans 2 When simulating the Xstrata price index, a dividend yield is included to account for the suppressing impact that a dividend payment has on the constituent share prices.
For the 2011 2011 simulation of Xstratas TSR and the Index TSR, a dividend yield is not required as TSR comprises share price growth and dividend distributions which are assumed to be reinvested into the shares.
