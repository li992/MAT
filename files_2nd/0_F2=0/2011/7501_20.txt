This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.
Included in the Companys trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of nil 2010: nil which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Company does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 30 days 2010: 30 days.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2011 2010 000 000 130 days 3160 days 6190 days 91 days Balance at 31 March past due but not impaired Current 45,546 157,880 Balance at 31 March 45,546 157,880 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
No allowance for doubtful debts is considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 107,308,000 2010: 50,663,000 comprise cash held by the Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

Financial risk management objectives The Companys principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The Company also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
HomeServe 141 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 56.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Companys long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Companys policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.

2011 2010 Increase in interest rate 10% 10% Increase in profit before tax 000 4 161 Credit risk The Company trades only with creditworthy third parties and subsidiary undertakings.
It is the Companys policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and cash equivalents the Companys exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Company manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Company has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Companys Board which sets the framework for the management of the Companys short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
