Group Accounts Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 78 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 30 December 2011 26 Acquisitions a Acquisition of subsidiary and other businesses Provisional fair value m Tangible fixed assets 1.6 Intangible assets: Trade names 6.9 Cash acquired 5.7 Other working capital 0.2 Deferred taxation note 20 1.7 Net assets acquired 12.3 Goodwill arising 5.3 17.6 Satisfied by: Cash paid on completion funded from internally generated cash flows 17.6 During 2011, the Group acquired the operational interest of 10 funeral locations.
These transactions were either acquisitions of trade and assets or acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of a limited company.
All these acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method.
None were individually material and consequently have been aggregated.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
This represents the value to the Group of the funeral locations.
The fair value adjustments contain provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2012.
These adjustments reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation and adjustments to reflect the fair value of other working capital movements such as debtors, inventories and accruals and are immaterial.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and as such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the post acquisition results.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.
