Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs, disposal gains and losses and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term and includes the benefit of tax amortisation where available on acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
exceptional restructuring costs in 2010 relate to the restructuring of the Reed Business information business.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration and professional and other transaction related fees and adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to exceptional restructuring and acquisition related costs.

Provisional fair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.
Fair Fair value value 2011 2010 m m Goodwill 345 32 intangible assets 358 32 Property, plant & equipment 1 Current assets 27 Current liabilities 53 2 Borrowings 21 Current tax 1 deferred tax 90 11 Net assets acquired 566 51 Consideration after taking account of 28m net cash acquired 566 51 less: consideration deferred to future years 31 6 less: acquisition date fair value of equity interest 12 Net cash flow 523 45 Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benefits which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual assets, skilled workforces, acquisition synergies that are specific to Reed elsevier, and high barriers to market entry.
in addition, goodwill arises on the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2012 combined financial statements.
there were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2010. the businesses acquired in 2011 contributed 39m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 9m, increased adjusted profit attributable by 9m, decreased profit attributable by 12m, and contributed 8m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit attributable and profit attributable for the year would have been 6,975m, 1,889m, 1,232m and 887m respectively before taking account of acquisition financing costs.
