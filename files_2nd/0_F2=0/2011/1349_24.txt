a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 23.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 30-60 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience reflecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to specific receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.
On this basis, the ageing analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is as follows: Trade receivables past due by: Less than 30 60 60 90 More than Current 30 days days days 90 days Total m m m m m m Carrying value at 30 April 2011 19.6 68.5 33.5 10.3 14.0 145.9 Carrying value at 30 April 2010 17.8 63.0 26.7 7.8 14.5 129.8 In practice, Sunbelt operates on 30 day terms and considers receivables past due if they are unpaid after 30 days.

The growth rate assumptions used in the plans reflect managements expectations of market developments and take account of past performance.
The valuation uses an annual growth rate to determine the cash flows beyond the three year period of 2%, which does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets, and a terminal value reflective of market multiples.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is 9.5% 2010: 9.0%.
The impairment review is sensitive to a change in key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the annuity growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the carrying value of the goodwill in Sunbelt being reduced to the recoverable amount.
A-Plant has headroom of 18m at the reporting date.
An increase in the discount rate of 9.5% by 0.9% or a decrease in the annuity growth rate of 2% by 1.1% would eradicate the headroom.

First priority senior secured credit facility During the year, the first priority asset-based senior secured loan facility ABL facility was renewed and now consists solely of a $1.4bn revolving credit facility committed until March 2016.
The ABL facility is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolving credit facility is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 200bp to LIBOR plus 250bp.
At 30 April 2011 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 225bp.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than $168m.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2011 was 287m $479m reflecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 16m $27m.
As the ABL facility is asset-based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount which could be drawn at 30 April 2011 was 765m $1,276m.
9% second priority senior secured notes due 2016 having a nominal value of $550m On 15 August 2006 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Capital, Inc. issued $550m of 9% second priority senior secured notes due 15 August 2016.
The notes are secured by second priority interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Under the terms of the 9% notes the Group is, subject to important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with another company.
The effective rates of interest at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2011 2010 First priority senior secured bank debt revolving advances in dollars 2.8% 3.0% term loan advances in dollars 2.1% Secured notes $550m nominal value 9.0% 9.0% Finance leases 7.8% 7.0% 16 Obligations under finance leases Minimum Present value of lease payments minimum lease payments 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Amounts payable under finance leases: Less than one year 1.8 3.2 1.6 3.1 Later than one year but not more than five 1.5 0.4 1.4 0.4 3.3 3.6 3.0 3.5 Future finance charges 0.3 0.1 3.0 3.5 The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets disclosed in note 12.

The provision is established based on advice received from independent actuaries of the estimated total cost of the self-insured retained risk based on historical claims experience.
The amount charged in the year is stated net of a 4.1m adjustment to reduce the provision held at 1 May 2010.
The majority of the provision for vacant property costs is expected to be utilised over a period of up to four years.

At the balance sheet date, no temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries are considered to exist as UK tax legislation largely exempts overseas dividends received from UK tax.
The Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences would not reverse in the foreseeable future.

It holds a beneficial interest in 5,630,628 ordinary shares of the Company acquired at an average cost of 118.9p per share.
The shares had a market value of 11.4m at 30 April 2011.
The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not significant.
Performance Share Plan Details of the Performance Share Plan PSP are given on pages 47 and 48.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2011, there was a net charge in respect of the PSP of 1.6m 2010: 0.5m.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 1.0m 2010: 0.2m.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 98.5p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 2.94%, volatility of 49.38%, a risk-free rate of 1.21% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.
Discretionary share option schemes Details of the discretionary share option schemes are given on page 47.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, Share-based payments, the Group has not recognised any expense for these schemes as they were all granted prior to 7 November 2002.

22 Pensions The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.
The major plans for new employees throughout the Group are all defined contribution plans following the introduction of the stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were 1.6m 2010: 1.0m.
The Group also has a defined benefit plan for UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
This plan is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2010 and updated to 30 April 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
The actuary is engaged by the Company to perform a valuation in accordance with IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuary were as follows: 2011 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% 3.6% Discount rate 5.3% 5.5% Inflation assumption RPI 3.4% 3.6% CPI 2.7% n a Weighted average expected return on plan assets 6.5% 6.6% Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 30 April 2011 update is based on the S1PxA CMI 2010 projection model mortality tables adjusted so as to apply a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.0% a year.

23 Financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports and pays dividends in pounds sterling.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas, the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of fixed and variable rate debt The Group has fixed and variable rate debt in issue with 41% of the drawn debt at a fixed rate as at 30 April 2011.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of fixed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds sterling plus 225bp.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2011, the Group had no such swap agreements outstanding.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2011, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax profits would change by approximately 5m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 3m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.
Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs is denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its financing such that, at 30 April 2011, virtually all of its debt was denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenue in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas profits into pounds sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2011, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax profits by approximately 0.4m and equity by approximately 3m.
At 30 April 2011, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 2011 2010 m m Cash and cash equivalents 18.8 54.8 Trade and other receivables 155.3 134.7 174.1 189.5 Substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2011 are deposited with one large UK-based financial institution which is not expected to fail.
The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving over 500,000 during the financial year, and does not have any significant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates significant free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash flow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2011, availability under this facility was $479m 287m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.

At 30 April 2011, the Group had no other derivative financial instruments.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2011.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

d Acquisitions 2011 2010 m m Cash consideration paid 34.8 0.2 25 Acquisitions 35m was spent on acquisitions in the year with the main transaction being Sunbelts acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Empire Scaffold LLC Empire on 10 January 2011.
Empire Empire was acquired for $39m 25m with an additional deferred cash consideration of $1.5m 1.0m payable depending on Empires profits in the year to 31 August 2011.
Empire is a specialist provider of scaffold rental, erection and dismantlement services principally to the Gulf Coast petrochemical industry.
This acquisition has enabled us to expand our specialty scaffolding services from the US eastern seaboard into new markets along the Gulf Coast.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 79 The net assets acquired and the provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition are as follows: Acquirees At provisional book value fair value m m Net assets acquired Trade and other receivables 6.6 6.4 Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 0.3 Property, plant and equipment rental equipment 11.6 6.4 other assets 0.4 0.4 Goodwill 4.4 Intangible assets brand name, customer contracts and relationships 6.4 Trade and other payables 2.0 2.0 Deferred tax liabilities 2.8 3.6 18.5 14.3 Consideration: cash paid and payable 25.0 deferred consideration to be satisfied in cash 1.0 26.0 Goodwill 11.7 The goodwill arising can be attributed to the key management personnel, workforce and safety record of the acquired business and the benefits the Group expects to derive from the acquisition.
This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Trade receivables at acquisition were 5.0m at fair value, net of 0.4m provision for debts which may not be collected, and had a gross face value of 5.4m.
Other receivables include prepaid expenses and accrued revenue.
Empires revenue and operating profit in the period from the date of acquisition to 30 April 2011 were 12.3m $19.3m and 1.2m $1.9m respectively.
Had the acquisition taken place on 1 May 2010, Group reported revenue and operating profit for the year ended 30 April 2011 would have been higher by 19.2m $30.0m and 2.4m $3.8m respectively.
Other In addition 10m was paid in the year to acquire 5.3m of tangible and 4.7m of intangible fixed assets.
26 Contingent liabilities Group The Group is subject to periodic legal claims in the ordinary course of its business, none of which is expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial position.
In Spring 2011, following audits of the tax returns of the Groups US subsidiaries for the four years ended 30 April 2009, the US Internal Revenue Service IRS issued revised assessments and associated notices of interest and penalties arising from its reclassification of certain US intercompany debt in those years from debt to equity and its consequent recharacterisation of US interest payments to the UK as equity-like distributions.
The revised assessments would result in additional net tax payments due of $32m together with interest and penalties of $13m.
Detailed protest letters setting out the reasons why we disagree with these assessments and believe that no adjustment is warranted were issued to the IRS on 29 March 2011.
If, contrary to our view, the IRS prevailed in its arguments the Group has been advised that application to the UK tax authorities under the Competent Authority procedure should enable a corresponding adjustment reducing UK intercompany interest receivable and hence UK tax to be agreed.
Taking account of this UK offset, the estimated impact of the IRSs proposed adjustments at 30 April 2011 would be to increase current tax payable by 27m, current tax receivable by 7m, deferred tax liabilities by 51m and deferred tax assets by 43m while shareholders equity would reduce by approximately 28m.
Having taken external professional advice, the directors consider that the adjustments proposed by the IRS audit team have no merit and intend to defend this position vigorously.
Whilst the procedures that have to be followed to resolve this sort of tax issue make it likely that it will be some years before the eventual outcome is known, the Board does not anticipate this matter having any material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
Company The Company has guaranteed the borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings under the Groups senior secured credit and overdraft facilities.
At 30 April 2011 the amount borrowed under these facilities was 474.2m 2010: 384.8m.
Subsidiary undertakings are also able to obtain letters of credit under these facilities and, at 30 April 2011, letters of credit issued under these arrangements totalled 16.1m $26.8m 2010: 19.1m or $29.3m.
In addition, the Company has guaranteed the 9% second priority senior secured notes with a par value of $550m 330m, issued by Ashtead Capital, Inc..
The Company has guaranteed operating and finance lease commitments of subsidiary undertakings where the minimum lease commitment at 30 April 2011 totalled 59.5m 2010: 71.5m in respect of land and buildings of which 6.9m is payable by subsidiary undertakings in the year ending 30 April 2012.
The minimum lease commitment at 30 April 2011 in respect of other lease rentals was nil 2010: 2.1m.
The Company has guaranteed the performance by subsidiaries of certain other obligations up to 0.7m 2010: 0.8m.
Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Capital commitments At 30 April 2011 capital commitments in respect of purchases of rental and other equipment totalled 173.1m 2010: 24.6m, all of which had been ordered.
There were no other material capital commitments at the year end.

Details of their remuneration together with their share interests and share option awards are given in the Directors Remuneration Report and form part of these financial statements.
29 Employees The average number of employees, including directors, during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 m m North America 5,600 5,675 United Kingdom 1,921 1,976 7,521 7,651 30 New accounting standards The Group has not adopted early the following pronouncements, which have been issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, but have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments was issued on 12 November 2009 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
The IASB has issued this standard as the first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories being amortised cost and fair value.
All equity and debt instruments are to be measured at fair value with the exception of a debt instrument being measured at amortised cost if it is being held by the entity to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
The requirement to separate embedded derivatives from financial assets within hybrid contracts has been removed with them being classified in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.
Two of the existing three fair value option criteria being loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments measured at amortised cost will become obsolete under this fair value-driven business model.
The EU has currently postponed its endorsement of this standard as its IFRS technical advisory body, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG has decided that more time should be taken to consider the output from the entire package of standards that are expected to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position on adoption.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures was issued on 7 October 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters was issued on 20 December 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets was issued on 20 December 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
The remaining pronouncements were all issued on 12 May 2011 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
The Group is currently assessing the impact and expected timing of adoption of these standards on the Groups results and financial position.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, which replaces parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and all of SIC-12 Consolidation special purpose entities, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
As a consequence of the issuance of IFRS 10, IAS 27 has been amended and now contains requirements relating only to separate financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements which replaces IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and SIC-13 Jointly controlled entities non-monetary contributions by venturers, requires a single method, known as the equity method, to account for interests in jointly controlled entities.
IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, has been amended as a consequence of the issuance of IFRS 11.
In addition to prescribing the accounting for investment in associates, it now sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for joint ventures.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities, is a new standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for entities covered under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, provides guidance on how fair value should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS, including a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS.
