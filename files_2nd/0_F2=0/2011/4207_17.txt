Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Group accounts 1.
Segmental analysis At 31 December 2011 the Group continued to be organised on a worldwide basis into two main business segments, relating to the manufacture and sale of the Groups products which are destined for either the Consumer Care market or the market for Industrial Specialities.
These are the segments for which summary management information is presented to the Groups Finance and Executive Committees, which are deemed to be the Groups Chief Operating Decision Makers.
With effect from 1 January 2012, the Groups reportable segments have been redefined to reflect a change in the Groups organisational structure.
From this date, the Groups Process Additives business, previously one of the business areas aggregated into the Industrial Specialities segment, is to be reported as a separate segment and will be renamed Industrial Chemicals.
The remainder of the segment previously reported as Industrial Specialities will be renamed Performance Technologies going forward.
The resulting three segments, Consumer Care, Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals will form the basis of the Groups internal reporting from 1 January 2012 onwards.
In the table below, financial information in respect of the new segment is shown as part of the existing segments.
There is no material trade between segments.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to a specific segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, inventories and trade and other receivables.

During the year, as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% that was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011 and that will be effective from 1 April 2012, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2012 and beyond has been measured using the 25% rate.
Further reductions to the UK tax rate have been announced.
The changes, which are expected to be enacted separately each year, propose to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in these financial statements.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in all cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.
If all earnings were remitted, an additional 1.8m 2010: 2.1m of tax would be payable.
All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in income with the exception of the charges shown in note 5 b, which have been recognised directly in equity.

Intangible assets Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant cash generating units CGU recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
The relevant CGU when testing the Uniqema goodwill of 193.4m is the Groups Consumer Care reporting segment.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups current year results and a future growth rate of 3% 2010: 3%.
The cashflows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 7.8% before tax 2010: 7.5%.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecast employed in the value in use calculation reflect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
The directors believe there are no reasonably probable significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.

Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Cash deposits 44.3 44.3 64.8 64.8 Other investments 15.4 15.4 14.0 14.0 2010 Club facility due 2015 182.4 182.4 210.6 210.6 $100m fixed rate 10 year bond 64.5 74.1 63.7 65.7 Other bank borrowings 27.9 27.9 10.0 10.0 Obligations under finance leases 0.6 0.6 0.8 0.8 For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
As noted in the accounting policies note on page 77, the Groups management of its currency risk includes the use of forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of the contracts in place at 31 December 2011 was 0.3 m 2010: 0.2m.
Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: l Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 l Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 l Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
With the exception of the HIG Capital Loan note note 16 which is categorised as Level 1, all financial assets and liabilities are Level 2.
Borrowing facilities As at 31 December 2011, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 201.5m 2010: 194.1m, all expiring in more than two years.
In addition the Group had other undrawn facilities of 65.5m 2010: 67.8m available.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest-rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee.
Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk.
Regular reports are received from all operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken.
76 Directors report | Business review Directors report | Governance Financial statements Other information Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Entities in the Group use forward contracts and foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge transactional risk up to three months forward.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so.
For 2011, had the Groups basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been 11m 2010: 10m lower higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Groups overseas entities, and equity would have been 20m 2010: 19m lower higher.
Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of its gross borrowings at floating interest rates and at 31 December 2011 over 75% of Group borrowings were at floating rates.
During 2010, to manage the Groups interest rate exposure, the Group issued a ten year fixed rate $100m loan note.
The loan note is repayable in 2020 and carries a fixed rate of 5.94%.
As at 31 December 2011, aside from the $100m loan note, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.94% 2010: 5.94%.
The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post tax profits would have moved by 0.2m 2010: 0.2m due to increased interest expense on the Groups floating rate borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
The Group also has a share buyback programme which is managed to ensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure.
On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders.
The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital.
In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt.
Given the Groups strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a new dividend policy in July 2011 of increasing the annual dividend to between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings.
Further details of the dividend policy can be found in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3.
During 2011, given the levels of surplus cash generated from strong trading, the Group repaid a further 50m to shareholders by means of a share buyback.
Should further organic investment be required or acquisition opportunities arise, less cash would be available for future buybacks.
Underlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital ROIC is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group.
The acquisition of Uniqema in 2006 reduced the ROIC, but also reduced Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC since the deal was predominantly financed through debt.
The Groups ROIC has grown steadily since the acquisition and now stands at 23.7% against a WACC of 7.8%, thus hitting the Groups target of maintaining ROIC at a higher level than the WACC.
In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure our ability to service our debt.
Both net debt EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2011.
The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year.
Additional information on performance against key performance indicators can be found in the Financial review on page 9.
ROIC Group profit after tax before exceptional items average invested capital.
WACC weighted average cost of servicing the Groups net debt and its equity share capital.
Average invested capital average net assets of the Group as at the start and end of the year adjusted to add back net debt, retirement benefit liabilities, tax balances and provisions.

The environmental provision relates to soil and potential ground water contamination at a number of sites, both currently in use and previously occupied, in Europe and the Americas.
Restructuring provisions relate to the remaining employee and property costs associated with the final elements of the Uniqema integration plan.
In relation to the environmental provision, the directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
With regard to the restructuring provision, the directors view is that the balance will be fully utilised by 2014.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
The Group has considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.

Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract.

Under the SIP scheme, employees enter into an agreement to purchase shares in the Company each month.
For each share purchased by an employee, the Company awards a matching share which passes to the employee after three years service.
The matching shares are allocated each month at market value with this fair value charge being recognised in the income statement in full in the year of allocation.
