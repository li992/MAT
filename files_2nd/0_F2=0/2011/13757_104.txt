Deferred taxation continued The deferred tax asset arises due to timing differences in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Given both recent and forecast trading, thedirectors are of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future is more likely than not to be sufficient to recover these assets.
Deferred tax liabilities of US$2,568 million 2010: US$2,349 million are expected to fall due after more than one year.
Deferred tax assets of US$103 million 2010: US$102 million are expected to be recovered after more than one year.
2011 2010 US$m US$m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: Tax losses 144 113 Tax credits 40 36 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 11 13 Share-based payments 29 17 Other deductible temporary differences 113 1 337 180 A significant part of the tax losses arise in the UK.
The value of the losses have been calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 26%.
It was announced that the rate will fall annually to 25%, 24% and 23% commencing 1 April 2012.
The impact of these reductions is not anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The deferred tax assets will not expire, with the exception of US$40 million 2010: US$36 million tax credits which will expire if conditions for utilisation are not met.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where there is an intention to distribute those reserves.
Adeferred tax liability of US$31 million 2010: US$31 million has been recognised.
A deferred tax liability of US$75 million 2010: US$46 million has also been recognised in respect of unremitted profits of associates where a dividend policy is not in place.
No deferred tax has been recognised on temporary differences of US$6,900 million 2010: US$5,600 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where either the overseas profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future, or, where there are plans to remit overseas earnings of subsidiaries, it is not expected that such distributions will give rise to a tax liability.
No deferred tax liability is recognised as the group is able tocontrol the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As a result of UK legislation which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the temporary differences arising on unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional corporate taxes.
However, remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in ataxliability, principally as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
