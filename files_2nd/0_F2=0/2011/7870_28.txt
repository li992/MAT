Investments The Companys cost of investment in subsidiary undertakings is stated at the aggregate of a the cash consideration and either b the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration when Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies or c in all other cases the market value of the Companys shares on the date they were issued as consideration.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Financial instruments The principal financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Groups risk management policy.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest in the profit and loss account.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Equity and equity-related compensation benets The Company operates a number of equity and equity-related compensation benets as set out in note 20 to the Group financial statements.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options are recharged to the principal employing company.
When a parent grants share-based payments to employees of a subsidiary, UITF41 Scope of FRS20 and UITF44 Group and Treasury Share Transactions states that the parent receives services from the employees indirectly through its subsidiary which should be accounted for as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary by the parent.
IMI plc Annual Report 2011 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C1.
significant accounting policies continued Equity and equity-related compensation benets continued Amounts recharged to subsidiaries are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in the subsidiary as this recharge is considered to form part of the determination of the net capital contribution from the parent in respect of the share-based payment arrangement.
Accordingly, there is no overall increase in the investment in subsidiaries recorded in the Companys financial statements.
The recharged amount is recognised as a debtor falling due for payment within one year.
The total amount recharged over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options at the date of grant is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the amount recharged to subsidiary undertakings.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Treasury shares The consideration paid by the Company on the acquisition of treasury shares is charged directly to retained earnings in the year of purchase.
If treasury shares are subsequently cancelled the nominal value of the cancelled shares is transferred from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
Dividends or shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Note 19 to the Group financial statements provides further details regarding the dened benefit scheme.

In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company, as parent of the IMI Group, has contingent liabilities in respect of contingencies within the Group as described in note 26 to the Group financial statements.
