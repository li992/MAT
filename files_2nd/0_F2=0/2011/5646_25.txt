The Invisible Enablers | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements 79 Notes 1.
Risk management Filtronas activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtronas system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent reviews by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Filtronas financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Filtrona has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Filtronas exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate.
Filtrona monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
The following table provides information on the trade and other receivables credit risk exposure.
2011 2010 m m Not impaired or past due: New customers less than one year 4.6 5.0 Existing customers more than one year with no defaults in the past 58.6 44.8 Past due not impaired 16.4 15.5 Impaired 3.6 2.4 Gross trade and other receivables 83.2 67.7 Impairment 6.7 2.4 76.5 65.3 Trade and other receivables carried at 85.4m 2010: 76.0m include prepayments and accrued income of 6.1m 2010: 4.7m which are not financial assets.
Therefore, these amounts are excluded from the above analysis.
Trade and other receivables also include deferred consideration of 2.8m 2010: 6.0m due from the Itavema Group for the purchase of the Globalpack business.
This amount is also excluded as it is included in the credit ratings analysis below.
Occasionally disputes arise that result in accounts becoming past due.
These are generally recovered in due course and the impairment allowance reflects managements best estimate of recovery.
During the year net impairment losses on trade and other receivables of 4.6m 2010: 0.1m have been recognised within net operating expense and 0.3m 2010: 1.5m of the impairment provision has been utilised.
80 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Notes 1.
Risk management continued Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.

ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Filtronas net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 31December2011, Filtronas euro-denominated assets were 92% hedged by its euro-denominated borrowings 2010: 47%, whilst its US dollar-denominated assets were approximately 59% 2010: 88% hedged by the US dollar-denominated borrowings.
The Invisible Enablers | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements 81 Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Filtronas transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 12 months.
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as most USdollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will be 100% effective.

The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 50bps, 100bps or 200bps decrease or increase in interest rates on the market values of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.

Risk management continued iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
On 16 August 2011 Filtrona signed an agreement with a syndicate of relationship banks to provide new banking facilities until August 2016.
This facility replaced its existing facilities which would have expired in April 2012.
Fees of 3.1m paid in respect of these facilities have been capitalised and are being expensed in the income statement over the expected life of the facilities in accordance with the effective interest method.
Filtronas objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Filtrona is mostly funded by two series of US$80m Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated five-year revolving credit facilities of 165.6m and 187.7m from its bankers.
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have maturities of seven and ten years and the revolving credit facilities mature in August 2016.
At 31December2011 the available bank and non-bank facilities totalled 425.2m 2010: 223.4m of which 181.1m 2010: 131.8m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtronas available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2011 2010 m m Expiring after one but within two years 91.6 Expiring after two years 244.1 244.1 91.6 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.
The maturity of Filtronas financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, is analysed below.
All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.
The Invisible Enablers | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements 83 Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Filtronas accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability.
2011 2010 Total Total carrying carrying Fair Loans and Amortised and fair Loans and Amortised and fair value receivables cost value Fair value receivables cost value m m m m m m m m Trade and other receivables 79.3 79.3 71.3 71.3 Derivative assets 1.2 1.2 0.4 0.4 Cash and cash equivalents 35.8 35.8 40.0 40.0 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 180.7 180.7 130.8 130.8 Derivative liabilities 0.5 0.5 2.5 2.5 Trade and other payables 56.2 56.2 37.1 37.1 0.7 115.1 236.9 121.1 2.1 111.3 167.9 58.7 Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
Fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by discounting cash flows at forward rates.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes.
The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 102.1m 2010: 100.6m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes is 117.6m 2010: 108.1m.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate fair values at the reporting date.
The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities fall within level one in the fair value hierarchy as they have been calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
iv Capital structure Filtrona defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy-backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2011, Filtronas strategy, which was unchanged from 2010, was to maintain the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt to EBITDA ratios at 31 December were: 2011 2010 Note m m Net debt excluding prepaid facility fees 21 148.7 92.3 Operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items 84.5 75.0 Plus depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment 3 20.7 21.9 Plus share option expense 18 3.0 2.8 EBITDA 108.2 99.7 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.37 0.93 84 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Notes 2.

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 17.9 years and 15.2years 2010: 21.8 years and 11.7 years respectively.
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each operating segment or business as appropriate.
The Invisible Enablers | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements 91 Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, being the operating segments, as follows: Goodwill 2011 2010 Operating segment m m Protection & Finishing Products 59.6 31.8 Porous Technologies 11.1 11.0 Coated & Security Products 15.7 16.1 86.4 58.9 Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below.

The pre-tax discount rates used ranged from 11.6% to 13.8% 2010: 11.6% to 13.8% Any impairments identified as a result of the analysis are expensed to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash flows by up to 25%, reducing terminal growth rates by up to eight percentage points or increasing pre-tax discount rates by up to 100 bps.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite significantly lower post-tax operating cash flows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to exceed their value in use.

Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.

Employee benefits Post-retirement benefits Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2009 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Defined benefit contributions in 2012 are expected to be 10.0m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in respect of past service.

Reid Supply, based in Michigan, US, is a leading distributor of standard industrial components, including hardware, handles, clamps and fasteners, to a vast range of markets and customers via a catalogue.
The business is highly complementary to Filtronas Protection & Finishing Products division.
Reid Supply contributed 7.7m to revenue and 0.5m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31December2011.
Related acquisition expenses of 0.7m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
On 21 December 2011, Filtrona acquired the entire issued share capital of Richco, Inc. Richco from family and employee shareholders of the acquired company.
Richco, based in Illinois, US, is a leading international designer, manufacturer and distributor of engineered plastic and elastomeric solutions for fastening and cable management applications in diverse and growing end markets and will be reported within Filtronas Protection & Finishing Products division.
Richco has been incorporated into Filtronas results based upon its balance sheet as at 21 December 2011 and accordingly contributed nil to revenue and an operating profit of nil in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2011.
Related acquisition expenses of 2.1m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of both businesses were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
A summary of the acquisition of Reid Supply is detailed below.
Book value Fair value of at acquisition Revaluation assets acquired m m m Deferred tax 0.2 0.2 Property, plant and equipment 0.7 0.2 0.5 Inventories 3.9 0.1 3.8 Receivables 2.9 0.1 2.8 Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.1 Provisions 0.1 0.1 Payables 1.4 0.2 1.6 6.0 0.5 5.5 Customer relationships 9.4 Other intangible assets 1.8 Goodwill 2.7 Consideration 19.4 Satisfied by: Initial cash consideration 18.2 Deferred contingent consideration 1.2 Cash consideration 18.2 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 0.1 Net cash outflow in respect of the acquisitions 18.3 Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, provisions and payables were all reassessed to their fair value.
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of the fair value adjustments above.
Deferred contingent consideration of 1.2m is payable by the Group if Reid Supply exceeds a target revenue during the 12 months to 31December 2012.
The book value of trade recievables aquired is stated net of impairment losses of 0.1m.
Included in the 2.7m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce.
Due to its nature this asset cannot be individually identified or measured.
It is expected that most of the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired will be allowable for tax deduction in future years.
The Invisible Enablers | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Statements 103 It is estimated that if the acquisition of Reid Supply had been completed on 1 January 2011 the contribution to 2011 Group revenue would have been 24.1m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been 2.2m.

Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, provisions and payables were all reassessed to their fair value.
The book value of trade receivables acquired is stated net of impairment losses of 0.3m.
Included in the 24.2m of goodwill recognised above is the value of the unique revenue and cost synergies including entry into new geographic and end markets where previously Protection & Finishing Products was not present and an assembled workforce.
It is expected that approximately 35% of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets will be allowable for tax deductions in future years.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Richco had been completed on 1 January 2011 the contribution to 2011 Group revenue would have been 47.2m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been 6.3m.
During 2011, Filtrona reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of Steratape, which was acquired in 2010, and increased certain accruals by 0.5m.
