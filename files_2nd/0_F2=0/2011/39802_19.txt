Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Groups financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 49.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and certain financial assets and liabilities.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
Management believes that the judgements, estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable, however actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements, where made, are disclosed within the relevant section of the financial statements in which such judgements have been applied.
The key estimates and assumptions relate to the property valuations applied by the Groups property valuers, the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations, valuation of share options granted under share-based payment schemes, valuation of the Companys investment in subsidiaries and the valuation of available-for-sale investments, and are described in more detail in the accounting policy notes below, or the applicable note to the financial statements.
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on the current or prior year reported results: IAS 24 amended, Related Party Disclosures: IAS 32 amended, Classification of Rights Issues: IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: IFRIC 14 amended, Repayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: and Improvements to IFRSs May 2010.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement: IFRIC 20, Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine: Amendments to IAS 1 June 2011 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income: Amendments to IAS 12 Dec 2010 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: Amendments to IFRS 1 Dec 2010 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters: Amendments to IFRS 7 Oct 2010 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets: IAS 19 revised June 2011 Employee Benefits: IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements: and IAS 28 revised May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
IFRS 9 is expected to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement applicable from 1 January 2013, subject to EU adoption.
While the full content of the standard is not yet known, it could impact the financial statements of the Group.
In addition, the amendment to IAS 28 and the introduction of IFRS 11, both of which are applicable from 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement, may impact the financial statements of the Group.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of other standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 2011 are: Balance sheet: 1 1.20 31 December 2010: 1 1.17 Income statement: 1 1.15 2010: 1 1.17 Investment properties These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for rent and development properties that are under development or available for development.
Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the income statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40 Investment Properties, no depreciation is provided.
Trading properties These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Property acquisitions and disposals Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
Previously acquisitions and disposals were recognised at unconditional exchange.
The change had no impact on prior period comparables.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management fee income, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Joint venture management fee income is recognised as income when earned.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 84 www.
com Financial Statements Rental income Rental income from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term rent averaging.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not fixed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are recognised as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Service charge income is netted against property operating expenses.
Financial instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts in managing interest rate risk and currency risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
Derivatives with a maturity of less than twelve months or that expect to be settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Other derivatives are presented as non-current assets or liabilities.
The comparative balances have been re-presented accordingly.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value based on quarterly reports received from the fund manager, or other market evidence where publicly traded.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement within other investment income.
Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through equity in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in note 21.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that performance will not be met.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model.

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations of the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, which were managed and reported to the Board as separate distinct locations.
Revenues from the most significant countries within Continental Europe were France 55.7 million 2010: 33.3 million and Germany 47.1 million 2010: 55.4 million.
The adjustments outlined above arise from adopting the Best Practices Recommendations of European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.
The EPRA profit measures highlight the underlying recurring performance of the property rental business, which is our core operational activity and also provide a consistent basis to enable a comparison between European property companies.

Further unrecognised tax losses of 369.6 million also exist at 31 December 2011 2010: 496.0 million of which 38.0 million 2010: 40.0 million expires in 15 years.
11 iv Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 23 per cent by 2014.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups tax charge.

Following clarification of EPRA best practice recommendations, foreign exchange and currency swaps are no longer excluded as they act as economic hedges of euro denominated assets that are included in EPRA NAV.
The comparative has been restated accordingly.
The tax effect of the fair value adjustment in respect of debt is no longer included as an adjustment to calculate EPRA triple net NAV as the Group does not believe that it will receive the economic benefit for that adjustment.

The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is valued by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung DTZ.
Valuations for the joint venture properties within the UK portfolio are performed by Jones Lang La Salle, formerly King Sturge APP and CBRE Big Box.
The valuations conform to International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of the transaction prices paid for similar properties.
DTZ, Jones Lang La Salle and CBRE also undertake some professional and letting work on behalf of the Group, although this is limited in relation to the activities of the Group as a whole.
All three firms have advised us that the total fees paid by the Group represent less than five per cent of their total revenue in any year.
Development properties include land available for development, land under development and construction in progress.
The historical cost of investment and development properties was 4,311.9 million 2010: 4,222.2 million and the cumulative valuation surplus at 31 December 2011 amounted to 4.7 million 2010: 276.1 million.
Long-term leasehold values within investment properties amount to 9.2 million 2010: 10.1 million.
All other properties are freehold.
Prepaid operating lease incentives at 31 December 2011 were 50.1 million 2010: 42.5 million.
While a number of the Groups property assets were identified as non-core during 2011, as at 31 December 2011 none of these was considered to meet the requirements of IFRS 5 to be presented as held for sale.
This reflects the fact that, whilst sales processes had been initiated for a number of assets, disposals were not sufficiently advanced to be considered highly probable of completing within 12 months, at 31 December 2011.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES Categories of financial instruments Financial assets in the Group comprise forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps and cross currency swap contracts which are categorised as derivatives designated as fair value through the income statement non hedge and foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges.
Financial assets also include trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, available-for-sale investments and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts which are categorised as fair value through the income statement non hedge and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.
Financial liabilities also include secured bank loans, unsecured bond issues, bank loans and overdrafts and preference shares, all of which are categorised as debt and initially recognised at fair value less costs and subsequently at amortised cost: and trade and other payables, provisions and current tax liabilities, which are classified as other financial liabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues and secured bank loans.
At 31 December 2011 the fair value of 1,796.9 million of unsecured bond issues was 1,980.0 million 2010: 1,794.1 million compared to 1,869.6 million fair value and the fair value of 52.4 million of secured bank loans was 52.2 million 2010: 61.3 million compared to 59.9 million fair value.
In addition, at 31 December 2010 the fair value of 42.7 million unsecured loan notes was 44.1 million.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps and currency swap contracts are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward exchange and currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps as detailed in notes 16, 17 and 18.
All of these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers between categories in the current or prior year.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and notes 22 to 24.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in note 19.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk management The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However, it does have operations in Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on page 49.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 100 www.
com Financial Statements The Groups balance sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2011 2010 Euros US dollars Total Euros US dollars Total Group m m m m m m Gross currency assets 1,670.0 26.6 1,696.6 1,726.6 32.8 1,759.4 Gross currency liabilities 1,418.2 12.5 1,430.7 1,398.0 19.4 1,417.4 Net exposure 251.8 14.1 265.9 328.6 13.4 342.0 Company Gross currency assets 1,127.3 9.9 1,137.2 938.9 12.7 951.6 Gross currency liabilities 1,333.3 22.3 1,355.6 1,145.7 31.9 1,177.6 Net exposure 206.0 12.4 218.4 206.8 19.2 226.0 2011 gross currency liabilities include EUR247.2 million 206.0 million and USD19.3 million 12.5 million designated as net investment hedges.
2010 gross currency liabilities include EUR244.2 million 208.7 million and USD30.3 million 19.4 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through inter-company funding arrangements.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 24.2 million 2010: 31.8 million, with a sensitivity of 22.9 million against the euro 2010: 30.6 million and 1.3 million against the US dollar 2010: 1.2 million.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 19.9 million 2010: 21.4 million with a sensitivity of 18.7 million against the euro 2010: 19.6 million and 1.1 million against the US dollar 2010: 1.8 million.
Forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts outstanding as at the year end: Currency contract Average exchange rates local currency Contract value Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 rate rate m m m m m m Group Economic cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.17 1.17 782.2 735.5 651.8 628.6 18.7 1.9 Buy euros sell sterling 1.17 49.1 40.9 0.8 Buy US dollars sell sterling 1.56 1.56 15.3 19.5 9.9 12.5 Net investment hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.15 1.17 247.2 244.2 206.0 208.7 10.7 0.1 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.56 1.58 19.3 30.3 12.5 19.4 0.1 0.3 Total 28.5 2.1 Company Economic cash flow hedges Sell euros buy sterling 1.16 1.17 1,029.4 979.7 857.9 837.3 29.4 1.8 Buy euros sell sterling 1.17 49.1 40.9 0.8 Buy US dollars sell sterling 1.56 1.56 15.3 19.5 9.9 12.5 Sell US dollars buy sterling 1.56 1.58 19.3 30.3 12.5 19.4 0.1 0.3 Total 28.5 2.1 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 101 www.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that around 60 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Treasury Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Group Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 would decrease increase by 4.9 million 2010: decrease increase by 4.3 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.

The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or Sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than five per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were approximately one per cent of total assets at 31 December 2011 and at 31 December 2010.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
2011 2010 Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables were as follows: m m 0-30 days 7.1 9.7 30-60 days 0.3 0.1 60-90 days 0.3 0.4 90-180 days 0.1 0.2 180 days 1.9 0.6 Past due but not impaired 9.7 11.0 Not due 21.2 19.2 Total trade receivables 30.9 30.2 No other receivables were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity Position and Going Concern sections in the Financial Review on page 49.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUES CONTINUED Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Background The Group has four defined benefit schemes in the UK, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the SEGRO scheme, the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme and two additional schemes following the acquisition of Brixton, the Brixton plc Pension Plan the Brixton scheme and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme the JSG scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held by Trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and Continental Europe for which 1.2 million has been recognised as an expense 2010: 1.3 million.
All four defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
Valuation of the schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations: 31 March 2010 for the SEGRO scheme, 5 April 2010 for the Bilton scheme, 31 December 2008 for the Brixton scheme and 30 June 2010 for the JSG scheme and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2011.
The actuarial valuation for the Brixton scheme at 31 December 2011 is expected to be finalised during 2012.
At the start of the year the Company had an unfunded, unapproved, retirement benefit scheme UURBS for one employee, the former Chief Executive Ian Coull.
This arrangement was a defined benefit scheme in nature.
On his retirement from the Company on 29 April 2011, Mr Coull elected to take a cash lump sum in respect of his UURBS benefit and has no further or additional benefits under the scheme.
The calculation used to value this unapproved benefit was based on assumptions which were consistent with those used in the SEGRO scheme.
2011 2010 The major assumptions used were as follows: % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.8 5.4 Rate of inflation RPI CPI 3.1 2.3 3.6 Rate of increase to pensions in payment in excess of GMP Before April 2003 SEGRO Bilton 4.2 3.0 4.3 3.4 From April 2003 to October 2005 3.0 3.4 After October 2005 2.1 2.2 Rate of general long-term increase in salaries 5.1 5.6 Expected Analysis Expected Analysis return of assets return of assets 2011 2011 2010 2010 Composition of scheme assets % m % m Equities 7.5 62.5 8.2 71.3 Gilts 2.9 54.7 4.2 56.9 Bonds 4.6 58.7 5.2 37.6 Insured pensions 4.8 1.7 5.4 1.9 Other assets 1.0 1.2 1.0 1.6 Overall SEGRO scheme 5.0 120.5 6.2 110.7 Overall Bilton scheme 4.5 23.6 5.6 23.1 Overall Brixton and JSG scheme 5.7 34.7 6.2 35.5 The life expectancies at age 65 are as follows: Male Female Current pensioners 23.8 23.9 Future pensioners 24.9 25.2 Both life expectancy estimates use the standard S1PA base tables with a scaling factor of 80 per cent for males and 100 per cent for females.
Future improvements to the life expectancy are in line with CMI 2009 projections with an assumed long-term rate of improvement of one per cent p. a.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes.
Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Bond and gilt returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
2011 2010 Charges on the basis of the assumptions were: m m Credit charge to Group income statement Operating profit: Current service cost 0.8 1.3 Past service cost 0.9 Settlement cost 0.6 Net finance costs: Interest on pension liabilities 9.5 9.7 Expected return on scheme assets 10.5 10.3 Net credit charge to the Group income statement 0.5 0.7 Charge to Group statement of comprehensive income 8.4 0.1 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 105 www.

There is also a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP for senior employees whereby 25 per cent of any payment under the Bonus Scheme is deferred in shares.
The DSBP is described on pages 66 and 68.
On 1 April 2011 awards were made over 270,246 shares based on a share price of 321.5 pence.
There have been no further awards, lapsings or vestings to the date of this report.
22 i LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme.
Shares are conditionally awarded based on individual performance.
Vesting of awards is subject to three-year performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 68.
In respect of the 2010 LTIP award onwards, UK participants will have an 18 month period from the release date in which to elect to receive their shares, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be entitled to the award, in which case the award will be pro-rated on length of employment in relation to the award date.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 331.3 pence, the closing mid-market share price on 28 March 2011.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to fair value the shares granted currently under award.
The assumptions used are as follows: Date of grant 20-Oct-09 28-Apr-10 29-Mar-11 Exercise price market price 385.0p 314.7p 331.3p Risk-free interest rate 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Dividend yield 2.6% 4.4% 4.5% Volatility 56.0% 57.0% 54.0% Term of option 3 years 3 years 3 years Fair value per share 356.0p 275.7p 289.0p 22 ii SIP The SIP is an HMRC approved all-employee share plan.

Participating employees may be awarded shares annually up to a maximum of seven per cent of their salary or 3,000, whichever is lower.
The award for 2011 was five per cent of salary.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is entitled to the shares due to certain leaver circumstances, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.

SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 22 iii GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group by the end of the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is entitled to the award due to the terms of leaving.

22 v Sharesave The Group operates an HMRC approved all-employee savings related share option plan.
UK employees can save on a monthly basis, over a three, five or seven-year period and if they remain in employment can purchase shares in the Company at a price which is fixed at the start of the saving period.
The price is usually set at a 20 per cent discount to the market.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, in certain circumstances the participant may be able to exercise their options within a fixed period from date of leaving.
During 2011, the movements in Sharesave options were as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted average Weighted Number of exercise Number of average options price options exercise price At 1 January 429,900 202.8p 494,560 205.8p Options granted 50,825 257.4p 79,118 255.7p Options exercised 27,850 182.0p 24,615 182.0p Options expired lapsed 46,945 250.6p 119,163 254.1p At 31 December 405,930 205.6p 429,900 202.8p The consideration received by the Company from options exercised during the year was 50,687 2010: 44,799.
