The Directors believe that the underlying profit before tax UPBT and underlying diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of Sainsburys ongoing business for shareholders.
Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The adjusted items are: Profit loss on disposal of properties: Investment property fair value movements these reflect the difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount at the previous reporting date: Financing fair value movements these are fair value gains and losses on non-derivative financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, on derivatives relating to financing activities and on hedged items in fair value hedges: Impairment of goodwill: The financing element of IAS 19 Employee Benefits: and One-off items these are items which are material and infrequent in nature and do not relate to the Groups underlying performance.

This change was substantively enacted in July 2010 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included in the figures above.
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 65 Financial Statements & additional information Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Income tax expense continued In addition to this, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
A resolution passed by Parliament on 29 March 2011 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 26.0 per cent from 1 April 2011.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26.0 per cent to 25.0 per cent from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1.0 per cent per annum to 23.0 per cent by 1 April 2014.
None of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, their effect is not included in these financial statements.
The effect of a 1.0 per cent reduction in the corporation tax rate on the deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date would reduce the deferred tax liability by 6 million which is primarily recognised in other comprehensive income.

For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the convertible bonds net of tax.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any profit or loss on disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements, IAS 19 pension financing element and one-off items that are material and infrequent in nature.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.

68 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Financial Statements & additional information Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment of property, plant and equipment In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit CGU.
CGUs are tested for impairment at each reporting date if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using the latest budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes in margin.
Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of three per cent to four per cent.
The discount rate is based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of ten per cent 2010: ten per cent.
Interest capitalised Interest capitalised included in additions amounted to 27 million 2010: 15 million for the Group and nil 2010: nil for the Company.
Accumulated interest capitalised included in the cost of property, plant and equipment net of disposals amounted to 273 million 2010: 267 million for the Group and nil 2010: nil for the Company.
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 5.0 per cent 2010: 4.0 per cent.
Security Property, plant and equipment of 130 2010: 129 supermarket properties, with a net book value of 2,323 million 2010: 2,344 million has been pledged as security for the long-term financing note 20.
In addition, property, plant and equipment of a further six supermarket properties, with a net book value of 69 million 2010: 70 million has been pledged as security to underpin the residual value guarantee given by the Group with regards to 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 and ten supermarket properties sold in July 2000.
On 17 June 2010, property, plant and equipment comprising eight supermarket properties, with a net book value of 167 million were transferred to the Sainsburys Property Scottish partnership see note 30.

The goodwill balance above relates primarily to the Groups acquisitions of Bells Stores Ltd, Jacksons Stores Ltd, JB Beaumont Ltd, SL Shaw Ltd, Culcheth Provision Stores Ltd, Town Centre Retail Bicester Ltd, SW Dewsbury Ltd and Portfolio Investments Ltd and is allocated to the respective cash-generating units CGUs within the Retailing segment.
The CGUs for this purpose are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of stores.
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU to the carrying value of its goodwill.
To calculate the CGUs value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to inflate at the long-term average growth rate for the UK food retail sector and are discounted at a pre-tax rate of ten per cent 2010: ten per cent over a 25 year period.
Based on the operating performance of the respective CGUs, no impairment loss was identified in the current financial year 2010: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert 211 million 2010: 211 million of the 1,069 million 2010: 1,100 million loan due 2018 from fixed to floating rates of interest.
These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges note 29.
In previous years, 572 million of swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were fide-designated from their fair value hedging relationship.
The fair value of the debt previously hedged by these swaps is being amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current financial year of 1 million 2010: 1 million.
Bank overdrafts Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above bank base rate.
Bank loan due 2012 The bank loan due 2012 is a bilateral loan with an outstanding principal of 50 million due May 2012 at floating rates of interest subject to a cap.

The e50 million loan has been swapped into a 45 million sterling floating rate loan with a cross currency swap.
Those transactions have been accounted for as fair value movements in future interest payments deferred through the cash flow hedge reserve.
Convertible bond due 2014 In July 2009, the Group issued 190 million of unsecured convertible bonds due July 2014.
The bonds pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent payable semi-annually.

28 Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to financial risks associated with movements in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity risks, and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate risks.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups treasury policies, as approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Funding and financial risk management are managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by identifying the various exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls.
The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has delegated responsibility for approving specific financial transactions.
The Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, regularly reviews risk positions and monitors Treasury performance.
The Group Audit Committee oversees management compliance with risk management policies and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted by Group Internal Audit who regularly review the Groups risk management controls and procedures.
Treasury operations in respect of Sainsburys Bank are managed separately through Lloyds Banking Group, the Groups joint venture partner.
Liquidity risk The Groups operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable, reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector.
Cash flow forecasts are produced regularly to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Groups liquidity policy requires that minimum funding headroom of 300 million is maintained in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time horizon.
The Group complies with this policy by minimising refinancing risk through long-dated core borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow and maintaining adequate standby liquidity.
The principal elements of the Groups core funding comprise two long-term loans of 1,069 million due 2018 and 840 million due 2031 secured over property assets held in two subsidiary companies.
In addition the Group has four unsecured bank loans totalling 225 million maturing between 2012 and 2015 and 190 million of convertible bonds due 2014.
Short term and seasonal funding is sourced from the wholesale inter-bank money market where interest is charged at various spreads above LIBOR.
For standby purposes the Group maintains a 690 million syndicated committed revolving credit facility due October 2015.
Interest on drawings under this facility is charged at various margins over LIBOR.
There are nil drawings under the facility as at 19 March 2011 2010: nil drawings.

Under the Groups credit policy investments are limited to counterparties with minimum credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poors and P1 from Moodys Investors Service or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAAm from Standard & Poors or Aaa MR1 from Moodys Investors Service.

The Group also has limited exposure in respect of recognised foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups currency risk management policy seeks to limit the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign currency cash flows in US dollars and euros to be hedged.
The future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis between 80 per cent and 20 per cent using forward contracts and options.
The Group has limited exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.
A 20 per cent change in the value of the US dollar versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss for the year by 2 million 2010: 2 million, as a result of gains or losses on translation of US dollar cash balances and US dollar denominated trade payables and receivables.
A 20 per cent increase in the US dollar spot rate versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have decreased the cash flow hedge reserve by 46 million 2010: 30 million in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts: a 20 per cent decrease in the same would increase the cash flow hedge reserve by 71 million 2010: 45 million.
A 20 per cent change in the value of euro versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have increased or decreased post-tax profit or loss for the year by 1 million 2010: 1 million, as a result of gains or losses on translation of euro cash balances and euro denominated trade payables and receivables.
A 20 per cent increase in the euro spot rate versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant would have decreased the cash flow hedge reserve by 12 million 2010: 17 million in relation to forward foreign exchange contracts: a 20 per cent decrease in the same would increase the cash flow hedge reserve by 18 million 2010: 26 million.
Movements of this magnitude in the other currencies noted above would have an immaterial impact.
b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings and deposits.
Interest rate policy seeks to minimise the cost and volatility of the Groups interest expense by maintaining a diversified portfolio of fixed rate, floating rate and inflation-linked liabilities.
i Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments The Group holds 1,259 million of fixed rate debt 2010: 1,290 million, of which 401 million 2010: 401 million has been swapped into floating rate debt using interest rate swaps.
The remaining 858 million 2010: 889 million portion of fixed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a credit to the income statement of 6 million 2010: nil.
The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 3 million 2010: 2 million which represents the ineffectiveness on the hedging relationship.
ii Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments The Group holds 686 million of floating rate borrowings 2010: 745 million, comprising 461 million of floating rate swaps 2010: 536 million and 225 million of floating rate debt 2010: 209 million.
An increase of 100 bps in the floating rate at the balance sheet date would have decreased post-tax profit by 5 million 2010: 5 million and a decrease of 100 bps in the floating rate at the balance sheet date would have increased post-tax profit by 4 million 2010: 3 million.
Where a decrease in interest rates of 100 bps would reflect a negative floating rate the assumed rate is nil.
The Group also holds 301 million of interest bearing assets 2010: 734 million.
An increase of 100 bps in the floating rate at the balance sheet date would have increased post-tax profit by 2 million 2010: 5 million and a decrease of 100 bps in the floating rate at the balance sheet date would have decreased post-tax profit by 2 million 2010: 3 million.
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 87 Financial Statements & additional information Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued iii Cash flow sensitivity for inflation-linked variable instruments The Group holds 840 million of inflation-linked debt 2010: 850 million which is recorded at amortised cost.
An increase of 100 bps in the RPI at the balance sheet date would have decreased post-tax profit by 6 million 2010: increase by 6 million and a decrease of 100 bps in the RPI at the balance sheet date would have increased post-tax profit by 6 million 2010: decrease by 1 million.
Where a decrease in RPI of 100 bps would reflect a negative rate, the assumed rate is nil.
iv Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale assets Included within available-for-sale financial assets is 140 million 2010: 126 million relating to the Groups beneficial interest in a property investment pool.
The net present value of the Groups interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of 3.2 per cent annum 2010: 3.1 per cent and a discount rate of ten per cent 2010: ten per cent, see note 15.
A change of 0.5 per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth to 2.7 per cent or 3.7 per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values for this asset of 128 million 2010: 116 million and 149 million 2010: 136 million respectively.
A change of one per cent in the discount rate to nine per cent or 11 per cent, holding other assumptions constant, would result in values of 155 million 2010: 143 million and 124 million 2010: 112 million respectively.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk within its commercial buying operations and with respect to its own use consumption of electricity, gas and fuel.
The Groups Energy Price Risk Committee limits the impact of movements in commodity prices on Group income by requiring forecast purchases of power and fuel to be hedged.
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference.
A 20 per cent change in the fair value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by 5 million 2010: 3 million.
The Group hedges electricity and gas exposures with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with the relevant suppliers.
Capital risk management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital structure consistent with the size and nature of the Group.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital and gearing to measure the efficiency of the Groups capital structure, the returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.5 times.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
Outside of this practice the Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.

The Group had purchased 83 million 2010: 115 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 1.13 to 1.21 2010: 1.10 to 1.18 with maturities from March 2011 to April 2013 2010: March 2010 to March 2011 and purchased US$463 million 2010: US$273 million and sold sterling at rates ranging from 1.45 to 1.67 2010: 1.45 to 1.70 with maturities from March 2011 to June 2012 2010: March 2010 to June 2011.
At 19 March 2011, an unrealised loss of 5 million 2010: gain of 7 million is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward contracts.
This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 23 months.
During the year a debit to the profit or loss of 8 million was transferred from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales 2010: credit of 8 million.
Commodity contracts cash flow hedges At 19 March 2011, the Group held a portfolio of commodity forward contracts with a fair value of 5 million 2010: 2 million to hedge its future own use fuel consumption over the next 12 months.
At 19 March 2011, an unrealised gain of 5 million 2010: gain of 2 million is included in other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts.
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.
Interest rate swaps fair value hedge The Group holds a portfolio of 401 million of interest rate swaps 2010: 401 million to hedge a portion of the fixed rate secured loan due in 2018 and the 190 million convertible bond due 2014.
Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed interest and pays floating rate interest at a fixed spread above three-month LIBOR.
The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps amortises from 211 million to 111 million from April 2016 to April 2018.
Derivative financial instruments fair value through profit or loss At 19 March 2011, the Group held a portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss which convert 331 million of the Groups floating rate obligations into fixed rates 2010: 256 million.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group pays fixed rates of interest and receives three-month LIBOR for periods expiring from 19 April 2018 to 19 April 2031.
Included in this portfolio is a 150 million swap under which the counterparty has a recurring option to cancel the swap on quarterly payment dates through to January 2031 at zero cost.
The Group holds a portfolio of non-designated interest rate swaps which convert 391 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates 2010: 391 million.
Under the terms of the swap the Group receives fixed rates of interest and pays interest at various spreads above three-month LIBOR until 19 April 2018.
Interest rate risk Financial instruments where interest is re-priced at intervals of one year or less are classified as floating rate.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Foreign currency risk The Group has net euro denominated trade creditors of 11 million 2010: 11 million and US dollar denominated trade creditors of 14 million 2010: 11 million.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices that are available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables, overdrafts, payables and loans of a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values, and are excluded from the analysis below.

The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2009 on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation were approved by the Schemes Trustees in June 2010.
The retirement benefit obligations at 19 March 2011 have been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this valuation.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
Sainsburys Property Scottish Limited Partnership Further to the funding plan agreed with the Schemes Trustees, on 17 June 2010 Sainsburys established the Sainsburys Property Scottish Partnership the Partnership with the Scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to a value of 256 million were transferred to the Partnership.
On 25 March 2011, further properties to a value of 501 million were transferred to the Partnership.
Both transfers were effected via a 30 year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 35 million for 20 years.
These contributions will be in addition to the Groups normal cash contributions paid to the Scheme annually.
The properties transferred to the Partnership will revert to Sainsburys ownership in 2030 in return for a cash payment equal to the amount of any remaining funding deficit on the Scheme at that time, up to a maximum of 600 million.
The Partnership is controlled by Sainsburys and its results are consolidated by the Group.
The Groups balance sheet, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership.
The investment held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.
The value of the properties transferred to the Partnership remains included within the Groups property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
In addition, the Group retains full operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute the properties within the Partnership.
Change to statutory basis for inflationary increases On 8 July 2010 the Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI will be used as the basis for inflationary increases to pensions in its next update of the statutory requirement.
Accordingly, the value of liabilities due to the past service cost of deferred members has been reduced by 185 million with the corresponding credit to actuarial gains within other comprehensive income in the current year.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Present value of funded obligations 4,945 4,649 Fair value of plan assets 4,614 4,237 331 412 Present value of unfunded obligations 9 9 Retirement benefit obligations 340 421 Deferred income tax asset 99 118 Net retirement benefit obligations 241 303 The retirement benefit obligations and the associated deferred income tax balance are shown within different line items on the face of the balance sheet.

The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking view of the financial markets as suggested by the yield available and the views of investment organisations.

e Sensitivities An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by 471 million.
A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 523 million.
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 315 million.
A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by 321 million.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 118 million.
The sensitivities are based on managements best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change.

National insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share-based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
At 19 March 2011, the carrying amount of national insurance contributions payable was 7 million 2010: 5 million of which 1 million 2010: 1 million was in respect of vested grants.
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below: a Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The Group operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months continuous service.
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980.
Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Groups employment at the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.

No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2011 2010 Share price at grant date pence 371 341 Exercise price pence 297 273 Expected volatility 3 year period % 34.3 38.3 5 year period % 29.5 31.3 Option life 3 year period years 3.2 3.2 5 year period years 5.2 5.2 Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield % 3.5 3.7 Risk-free interest rate 3 year period % 3.2 3.7 5 year period % 4.4 4.6 Fair value per option 3 year period pence 109 107 5 year period pence 114 107 The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Groups share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for managements view of future volatility of the share price.
b Colleague Share Option Plan CSOP At 19 March 2011, a total of nil UK employees 2010: 1,253 participated in the plan and held options over nil shares 2010: 0.4 million.
Of the final options awarded in 1999 and 2000 as part of the CSOP 0.2 million options were exercised and 0.2 million options expired during the year.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.
The weighted average exercise price for options exercised in the year was 321 pence 2010: 325 pence.
c Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Under the Executive Share Option Plan, participants were granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to inflation over a three-year period.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed-point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.

e Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares are conditionally awarded to the top 1,000 managers in the Company, from the Chief Executive to the supermarket store managers.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
The awards will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions return on capital employed ROCE and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period.
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released.
Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released no later than on the fourth anniversary of the date of award.
Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.
To achieve the maximum multiplier of four, the following criteria are required to be met.

f Deferred Annual Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan applies to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and currently comprises around 40 participants in total.
The first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 24 March 2007.
The second deferral took place in June 2008, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008.
The third and final deferral took place in June 2009, in respect to bonus awards for the financial year ended 21 March 2009.
The Plan measures the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail comparator group comprising: Tesco, Morrisons, DSG International, Kingfisher, Home Retail Group, Marks & Spencer, Next, Ahold, Carrefour, Casino, Delhaize and Metro.
Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its fide-listing.
Up to two matched shares may be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure is achieved.
No shares are awarded for below median performance, and the full match will only apply where the Company achieves first place within the comparator group.
At median position the match will be 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match will be pro-rated at every position between median and first place.
To the extent that the performance condition is met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares will be added to the deferred bonus shares.
The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares can be accessed immediately, while the remainder will be held over for a further year.
Dividends or their equivalents will accrue on shares that vest.

These are intended to reward the top 40 managers in the Company, including Executive Directors for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company.
Share-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of key strategic measures.
At least 50 per cent of the award is based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders.
The balance is based on measures which will assess the Companys performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year, but any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that managements interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders.
The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date.
