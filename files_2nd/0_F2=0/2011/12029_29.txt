Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors O Slipper Director Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Perform Group plc Parent company financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 The individual financial statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable UK GAAP accountingstandards.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the financial year and theprecedingyear.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law.
The Company had cash balances of 65,016,000 at the year end and no borrowings.
Having reviewed cashflow forecasts and budgets forthe year ahead the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Exemptions The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented aprofit and loss account for the Company alone.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Parties from disclosing related-party transactions with entities that are wholly owned and part of the Perform Group plc group.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of management services to the Group's subsidiaries and are also derived from theGroup's continuing, ordinary activities, after the deduction of value added tax.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions of individual companies are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing spot rate.
Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and further excludes items that are never taxable ordeductible.
The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement todispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, itismore likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assetsare sold: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
94 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees' services are determined indirectly by reference tothe fair value of the instrument granted to the employee.
This fair value is appraised at the grant date and for cash settled instruments isre-appraised at each balance sheet date.
All equity settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit toreserves.
All cash settled share-based payments have a corresponding liability.
If vesting periods apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period.
Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indications that thenumber of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
