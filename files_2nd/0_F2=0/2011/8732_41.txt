Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21.
Trade and other receivables continued The Board consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the majority of the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Therefore, no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for impairment losses, which has been calculated following individual assessments of credit quality based on historic default rates and knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk.
Movement on this provision is shown below: GROUP COMPANY 000 000 At 31 January 2009 188 - Created 241 108 Released 105 - On acquisition of subsidiaries 661 - Utilised 69 - At 30 January 2010 916 108 Created 715 114 Released 45 - Utilised 724 - At 29 January 2011 862 222 The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
