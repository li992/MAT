Depreciation of fi xed assets Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on all other tangible fi xed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
In addition, subsequent to the adoption of UITF Abstract 41, investments in subsidiaries also include the FRS 20 cost of share-based payments.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

Where Group relief is surrendered from other subsidiaries in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering company an amount equal to the loss surrendered multiplied by the current tax rate.
