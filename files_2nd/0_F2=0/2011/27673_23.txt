Basis of preparation The reconciliation of adjusted operating profit has been prepared so as to reflect the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
The statement reconciles adjusted operating profit to profit after tax as reported under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
For core life assurance and general insurance businesses, adjusted operating profit is based on a long-term investment return, including investment returns on life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For the US Asset Management business it includes compensation costs in respect of certain long-term incentive schemes defined as non-controlling interests in accordance with IFRS.
For all core businesses, adjusted operating profit excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of acquisition accounting, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, profit loss on acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, and fair value profits losses on certain Group debt movements but includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Bermuda, which is non-core, and Nordic and US Life, which are discontinued and non-core, are not included in adjusted operating profit.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as adjusted operating profit.
It is stated after tax attributable to adjusted operating profit and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.
