For pensions accrued after 5 April 2005, pension increases in payment are subject to a cap of 2.5% per annum.
For pensions accrued prior to 5 April 2005, pension increases in payment are subject to a cap of 5% per annum.
The effect of the change to the CPI of 2.7m was reflected within actuarial gains in the financial statements in 2010.
The retirement arrangements in Hong Kong pays lump sums to members instead of pensions and the Swiss scheme is an insured plan.
The expected rates of return on scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices which take into account the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with equities and the expectation for future returns on such assets.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the reporting date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments.
This is based on an out-performance assumption over gilt yields.

Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the members, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong scheme.
The table above shows, for the United Kingdom scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December.
The 2011 mortality tables adopted for the United Kingdom scheme are the S1PA projected by year of birth, with an allowance for the medium cohort effect and a minimum improvement of 1% the same tables were used in 2010.
For the Swiss scheme, the mortality table adopted is the BVG 2010 an updated version of BVG 2005 adopted last year, an industry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Swiss pension funds.

The fair value of the employee services, received in exchange for the grant of share options or shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge for the share options and for the share awards is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting where conditions are non-market based.
The expense of the Performance Awards, previously Matching Awards, is also additionally adjusted for the probability of performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and has recognised an expense only in respect of share options and awards granted since 7 November 2002.
Share option schemes The Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997.
The maximum number of options that can be granted under the scheme have been allocated and that scheme has been discontinued.
In May 2002, the Intertek Group plc 2002 Share Option Plan the 2002 Plan and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option Plan the Approved Plan were established for employees to be granted share options at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
These plans have also been discontinued and the last grants under these plans were made in September 2005.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted Weighted average average exercise Number of exercise Number of price options price options At beginning of year 631p 379,347 646p 813,457 Exercised 659p 72,839 599p 423,749 Forfeited 578p 21,244 769p 10,361 Outstanding options at end of year 628p 285,264 631p 379,347 Exercisable at end of year 628p 285,264 631p 379,347 The weighted average share price of the Company at the date of exercise of share options was 1,956p 2010: 1,534p.
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 359p to 778p and a weighted average contractual life of 2.6 years.
com Notes to the financial statements 17 Share schemes continued Share Plans As explained in the Remuneration Report on page 48, the Deferred Bonus Plan 2005 was replaced in 2011 with the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan.
Share awards from 2011 previously deferred share awards and Performance awards previously matching share awards have been granted under this plan.
The first awards were granted on 7 April 2006.
The awards under these plans vest three years after grant date, subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions.
Mirror share awards On 14 May 2010, Lloyd Pitchford was granted conditional rights to acquire 49,039 shares of 1p in Intertek Group plc under a one-off arrangement to facilitate his recruitment as Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
At 31 December 2011, there were 9,899 shares outstanding 2010: 26,933 shares.
Further details are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 56.
Equity-settled transactions In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for shares granted to employees, is measured by reference to the fair value of shares granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Monte Carlo formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of shares and share options.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group recognised an expense of 9.5m 2010: 7.4m.
The fair values and the assumptions used in their calculations are set out below: Share awards Performance Awards TSR Share Awards element previously previously Deferred Matching Deferred Matching Deferred Matching Share Share Share Share Share Awards Share Awards Awards Awards Awards Awards Year shares awarded 2011 2011 2010 2010 2009 2009 Fair value at measurement date pence 1,872.3 1,252.6 1,249.5 854.7 839.3 697.8 Share price pence 1,955.0 1,955.0 1,324.0 1,324.0 899.5 899.5 Expected volatility n a 30.8% n a 30.8% n a 29.1% Dividend yield 1.4% 1.4% 1.9% 1.9% 2.3% 2.3% Risk free interest rate n a 1.4% n a 3.0% n a 1.8% Time to maturity years 33 3333 The fair values and assumptions are also the same for the EPS element of the Performance awards.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
All Share Awards previously Deferred Share Awards are granted under a service condition.
Such condition is not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
The Performance awards TSR element, previously Matching Awards are granted under a performance related market condition and as a result this condition is taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 103 Notes to the financial statements 18 Subsequent events 2012 Private placement bonds In October 2011 the Group secured funding of US$265m by way of a senior note issue.
The funds were received in January 2012.
These notes were issued in three tranches with US$20m repayable on 18 January 2019 at a fixed annual interest rate of 3%, US$140m repayable on 18 January 2022 at a fixed annual interest rate of 3.75% and US$105m repayable on 18 January 2024 at a fixed annual interest rate of 3.85%.
These funds were used to repay and cancel the US$300m bridge facility with effect from February 2012.
19 Capital management The Directors have to determine the appropriate capital structure of Intertek: specifically how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities.
These activities include ongoing operations as well as acquisitions as described in note 10.
The Groups policy is to maintain a robust capital base including cash and debt to ensure the market and key stakeholders retain confidence in the capital profile.
Debt capital is monitored by Group Treasury assessing the liquidity buffer on a short and longer term basis as discussed in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
The Group uses KPIs, including return on invested capital and diluted adjusted earnings per share to monitor the capital position of the Group to ensure it is being utilised effectively.
The dividend policy also forms part of the Boards capital management policy, and the Board ensures there is appropriate earnings cover for the dividend proposed at both the interim and year end.
20 Non-controlling interest Accounting policy Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The purchase of non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Non-controlling interest An analysis of the movement in non-controlling interest is shown below: 2011 2010 m m At 1 January 23.1 18.0 Exchange adjustments 0.1 1.2 Share of profit for the year 12.3 10.4 Additions 0.3 0.1 Purchase of non-controlling interest 1.2 Dividends paid to non-controlling interest 10.4 6.6 At 31 December 24.0 23.1 In 2011, the Group purchased a non-controlling interest for cash consideration of 1.8m and recognised a decrease in a non-controlling interest of 1.2m and a decrease in retained earnings of 0.6m.
com Notes to the financial statements 21 Related parties Identity of related parties The Group has a related party relationship with its key management.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation and are not discussed in this note.
Transactions with key management personnel Key management personnel compensation, including the Groups Directors, is shown in the table below: 2011 2010 m m Short-term benefits 5.9 6.2 Post-employment benefits 0.4 0.4 Equity-settled transactions 2.1 2.3 Total 8.4 8.9 More detailed information concerning Directors remuneration, shareholdings, pension entitlements, share options and other long-term incentive plans is shown in the audited part of the Remuneration Report.
Apart from the above, no member of key management had a personal interest in any business transactions of the Group.
22 Contingent liabilities 2011 2010 m m Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds 11.4 7.4 Litigation From time-to-time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes with employees and former employees.
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of litigation to which the Intertek Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen as in some cases the facts are unclear or further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Tax The Group operates in more than 100 countries and is subject to a wide range of complex tax laws and regulations.
At any point in time it is normal for there to be a number of open years in any particular territory which may be subject to enquiry by local authorities.
Where the effect of the laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve.
The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial statements.

Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and lossaccount.
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated financial statements which it has prepared.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not there willbe suitable taxable profits to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Intercompany financial guarantees When the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, theCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability, until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments Intertek Group plc runs a share ownership programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
Details of the share schemes are given in note 17 of the Group financial statements.
The fair value of options and share awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised as an employee expense with acorresponding increase in equity.
As the Company has no employees, there is no recognition of an employee expense nor the corresponding increase in equity.
However, the Company grants options and awards over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and therefore the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries, equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in respect of employees of the subsidiaries, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value granted is measured using the Monte Carlo model.
This method, in calculating the fair value, takes into account various factors including the expected volatility of the shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
The fair value of shares granted under the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan is also measured using the Monte Carlo model and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
