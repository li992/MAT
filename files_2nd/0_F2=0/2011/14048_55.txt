Goodwill continued Key assumptions The value in use calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five-year period, and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with a growth rate assumption applied.
The key assumptions affecting the CGUs within each operating segment are discussed below.
The Directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes relating to these key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Short-term growth rates Short-term revenue growth rates used in each CGU five-year plan are based on internal data regarding the current pipeline of opportunities and published industry forecasts for the relevant market.
Further discussion of the Groups order book and pipeline is provided in the Our business and Our performance sections.
Terminal growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the five-year period are based upon managements estimate of the growth rates of the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
Where possible these have been derived with reference to external sources.
The range of terminal growth rates applied to the CGUs within each operating segment are set out below: 2011 2010 % % Civil Government 2.5 2.5 Defence, Science and Nuclear 2.5 2.5 Local Government and Commercial 2.5 2.5 Americas 3.0 3.0 AMEAA 2.5 7.0 2.5 7.0 These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual market sectors.
Discount rate Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital have been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
These rates are adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates, including but not limited to: geographic and economic risks, contract length and customer type.
