The main share-based payment plans that existed during the year are detailed below.
Plans for executive directors For further information on the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP see the Directors remuneration report on pages 139 to 151.
Plans for senior employees The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain other employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons.
Grants are settled in cash where the regulatory environment prohibits participants to hold BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is related to the level of seniority of employees.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
The main performance measure used is BPs total shareholder return TSR compared to the other oil majors.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP, and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
