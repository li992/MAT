GP and UKCPH are partners in a Guernsey Limited Partnership the Partnership and own six Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
UKCPEL owns 3 Jersey Property Unit Trusts.
The Partnership, UKCPH and UCKPEL own a portfolio of UK properties and derived rental income from those properties.

Market value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amount for which each asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 1,016,450,000 2010 898,750,000.
The difference between the market value and the fair value at 31 December 2011 consists of accrued income relating to the pre-payment for rent-free periods recognised over the life of the lease totalling 4,675,000 2010 Nil which is separately recorded in the accounts as a current asset.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 18 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Groups investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
In addition to the above, the property portfolio market value as at 31 December 2011 is based on the following: The Estimated Net Annual Rent for each property, which is based on the current rental value of each of the properties, which reflects the terms of the leases where the property, or part of the property, are let at the date of valuation.
If the property, or parts thereof, are vacant at the date of valuation, the rental value reflects the rent the valuer considers would be obtainable on an open market letting as at the date of valuation.
The valuer has assumed that all rent reviews are to be assessed by reference to full current rents.
Also there is the assumption that all tenants will meet their obligations under their leases, and are responsible for insurance, payment of business rates, and all repairs, whether directly or by means of a service charge.
The valuer has not made any adjustments to reflect any liability to taxation that may arise on disposal, nor any costs associated with disposals incurred by the owner.
The valuer assumes an initial yield in the region of 5 to 7 per cent for the majority of the properties, with the reversionary yield being in the region of 6 to 7 per cent.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Manager advises of the presence of such materials.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs or maintenance to its investment properties.

36 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 224170 UKCPT pp32-pp42 22 03 2012 13:21 Page 37 Interest rate exposure has been hedged by the purchase of two interest rate swap contracts.
The hedge has been achieved by matching the notional amount of the swaps with the loan principal and matching the swap term to the loan term.
Interest on the swaps is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 3.0 per cent per annum on 42.1 million and 2.215 per cent per annum on 37.9 million respectively.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the two interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2011 is 4 million 2010: 1.4 million which is based on the marked to market value.
Both swaps are deemed effective for accounting purposes.
Interest is payable by the Company at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the Gross Assets Value, expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage.
Gross Assets Value takes into account the value of the properties and any other assets held by the Company and the Guarantors currently UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited, UK Commercial Property GP Limited and UKCPT Limited Partnership as well as unsecured cash.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 5 per cent and does not exceed 10 per cent, the margin is 0.55 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 10 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 0.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 50 per cent, the margin is 0.70 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2011 the applicable margin was 0.60 per cent.
The Group also has a seven year 150 million facility, maturing in May 2018, with Barclays Bank plc taken out in May 2011.
As at 31 December 2011, 60 million of this loan was drawn down.
The bank loan is secured on the property portfolio held by UKCPEL.
Under bank covenants related to the loan UKCPEL is to ensure that at all times: The loan to value percentage does not exceed 60 per cent Interest cover at the relevant payment date is not less than 160 per cent UKPCEL met all covenant tests during the year.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had in place a 100 million interest rate swap with Barclays bank plc.
60 million of this interest rate swap effectively hedged the current drawn down loan with Barclays Bank plc.
The remainder of this interest rate swap is therefore deemed as an ineffective swap under International Financial Reporting Standards.
Interest on the swap is receivable at a variable rate calculated on the same LIBOR basis as for the bank loan as detailed below but excluding margins and payable at a fixed rate of 2.9925 per cent per annum.
The fair value of the liability in respect of the interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2011 is 9.3 million 2010: Nil which is based on the marked to market value.
Interest is payable by UKPCEL at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR, mandatory costs of the Bank and a margin.
The applicable margin depends on the ratio of all loans made available to the Company under the Bank Facility or otherwise to the market value of the property portfolio in UKCPEL expressed as a percentage the LTV Percentage as well as any cash generated from the sale of one of these properties.
If the LTV percentage is equal to or less than 25 per cent, the margin is 1.60 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 25 per cent and does not exceed 35 per cent, the margin is 1.70 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 35 per cent and does not exceed 40 per cent, the margin is 1.85 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 40 per cent and does not exceed 45 per cent, the margin is 1.95 per cent per annum.
If the LTV Percentage is greater than 45 per cent and does not exceed 60 per cent, the margin is 2.0 per cent per annum.
As at 31 December 2011 the applicable margin was 1.60 per cent.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had in place interest rate swap instruments totalling 180 million of which 140 million were deemed to be effective hedges with the remaining 40 million ineffective hedges.
The revaluation of these swaps at the year end resulted in a loss arising on interest rate swaps of 12.0 million.
Of the total loss arising on interest rate swaps, 8.3 million related to effective hedge instruments and 3.7 million related to ineffective hedge instruments.
The ineffective portion of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss and the effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2011 amounted to 13.4 million.
Based on current yield curves 3.1 million of this value relates to the next 12 months and is therefore classified as a current liability.
The remainder is classified as a long term liability.

Financial Instruments and Investment Properties The Groups investment objective is to provide Ordinary Shareholders with an attractive level of income together with the potential for income and capital growth from investing in a diversified UK commercial property portfolio.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments.
The Groups financial instruments consist of cash, receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations and loan facilities and swap instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing its risk exposure.
These policies are summarised below and remained unchanged during the year.
Fair values The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the carrying value in the financial statements.
38 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 224170 UKCPT pp32-pp42 22 03 2012 13:21 Page 39 Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy: 31 December 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 13,362 - 13,362 31 December 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value 000 000 000 000 Interest rate swap - 1,353 - 1,353 Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of the derivative interest rate swap contract is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the market value of properties and financial instruments will change.
A 10 per cent increase in the fair value of the investment properties held as at 31 December 2011 would have increased net assets available to shareholders and increased the net profit by 101.2 million 2010: 89.9 million.
A 10 per cent decrease in the fair value would have reduced net assets available to shareholders and net profit by 101.2 million 2010: 89.9 million.
The calculations above are based on investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole, nor reflective of future market conditions.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Assets 2011 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 60,945 - - 60,945 Rent receivable 513 - - 513 Other debtors - 145 561 706 61,458 145 561 62,164 Financial Assets 2010 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Cash 80,937 - - 80,937 Rent receivable 806 - - 806 Other debtors - - 571 571 81,743 - 571 82,314 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 39 224170 UKCPT pp32-pp42 22 03 2012 13:21 Page 40 Notes to the Accounts continued In the event of default by a tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property until it is re-let.
The Board receives regular reports on concentrations of risk and any tenants in arrears.
The Investment Manager monitors such reports in order to anticipate and minimise the impact of defaults by tenants.
The Company has a diversified tenant portfolio.
The maximum credit risk from the rent receivables of the Group at 31 December 2011 is 513,000 2010: 806,000.
The Group holds rental deposits of 561,000 2010: 571,000 as collateral against tenant arrears defaults.
There is no credit risk associated with the financial liabilities of the Group.
All of the cash is placed with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
12.7 million 2010: 46 million of the year end cash balance is held in the Ignis Liquidity Fund, which is a money market fund and has a triple A rating.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of a financial institution may cause the Groups ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited.
Should the credit quality or the financial position of the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, the Investment Manager would move the cash holdings to another financial institution subject to restrictions under the loan facility.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
While commercial properties are not immediately realisable, the Group has sufficient cash resources to meet liabilities.
The Groups liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Investment Manager and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Board.
In certain circumstances, the terms of the Groups bank loan entitles the lender to require early repayment, and in such circumstances the Groups ability to maintain dividend levels and the net asset value attributable to the ordinary shares could be adversely affected.
At the reporting date, the maturity of the Groups liabilities was: Financial Liabilities 2011 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan and interest rate swap 1,546 4,639 176,395 182,580 Other creditors 21,152 - 561 21,713 22,698 4,639 176,956 204,293 Financial Liabilities 2010 3 months More than More than Total or less 3 months but less one year than one year 000 000 000 000 Bank loan 377 1,131 47,917 49,425 Other creditors 17,260 - 571 17,831 17,637 1,131 48,488 67,256 40 UK COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST LIMITED 224170 UKCPT pp32-pp42 22 03 2012 13:21 Page 41 Interest rate risk The cash balance as shown in the Balance Sheet, is its carrying amount and has a maturity of less than one year.
Interest is receivable on cash at a variable rate ranging between 0.2 per cent to 0.5 per cent at the year end and deposits are re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
An increase of 1 per cent in interest rates as at the reporting date would have increased the reported profit by 1,009,000 2010: increased the reported profit by 809,000.
A decrease of 1 per cent would have reduced the reported profit by 1,009,000 2010: decreased the reported profit by 809,000.
The effect on equity is nil excluding the impact of a charge in retained earnings as a result of a change in net profit.
As the Companys bank loans have been hedged by interest rate swaps, these loans are not subject to interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2011 the Company had in place a total of 180 million of interest rate swap instruments.
The value of these instruments are marked to market and will change if interest rates change.
It is estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability falling by 8.7 million which would increase the reported profit by the same amount.
A decrease of 1 per cent in interest rates would result in the swap liability increasing by 9.8 million which would decrease the reported profit by the same amount.
The other financial assets and liabilities of Group are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk There was no foreign currency risk as at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010 as assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds Sterling.
Capital Management Policies The Group considers that capital comprises issued ordinary shares, net of shares held in treasury, and long-term borrowings.
The Groups capital is deployed in the acquisition and management of property assets meeting the Groups investment criteria with a view to earning returns for shareholders which are typically made by way of payment of regular dividends.
The Company also has a policy on the buyback of shares which it sets out in the Directors Authority to Buy Back Shares section of the Directors Report.
The Groups capital is managed in accordance with investment policy which is to hold a diversified property portfolio of freehold and long leasehold UK commercial properties.
The Group invests in income producing properties.
The Group will principally invest in three commercial property sectors: office, retail and industrial.
The Group is permitted to invest up to 15 per cent of its Total Assets in indirect property funds and other listed investment companies.
The Group is permitted to invest cash, held by it for working capital purposes and awaiting investments, in cash deposits, gilts and money market funds.
The Group monitors capital primarily through regular financial reporting and also through a gearing policy.
Gearing is defined as gross borrowings divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The Groups gearing policy is set out in the Investment Policy section of the Report of the Directors.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements but does have banking covenants on which it monitors and reports on a quarterly basis.
Included in these covenants are requirements to monitor loan to value ratios which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the market value of the properties secured.
The Groups Loan to value ratio is shown below.
The Group did not breach any of its loan covenants, nor did it default on any other of its obligations under its loan arrangements in the year to 31 December 2011.
2011 2010 000 000 Carrying amount of interest-bearing loans and borrowings 138,141 41,884 External valuation of completed investment property 1,016,450 898,750 Loan to value ratio 13.59% 4.66% The Groups capital balances are set out on page 27 and are regarded as the Groups equity and net funds.

Capital Commitments The Company has no contracted capital commitments as at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 16 million.
Lease Length The Group leases out its investment properties under operating leases.
The future income under non-cancellable operating leases, based on the unexpired lease length at the year end was as follows based on total rentals : 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 000 000 Less than one year 69,767 62,525 Between one and five years 211,816 201,276 Over five years 365,574 338,529 Total 647,157 602,330 The largest single tenant at the year end accounted for 6.13 per cent 2010: 6.47 per cent of the current annual rental income.
The unoccupied property expressed as a percentage of annualised total rental value was 3.4 per cent 2010: 3.6 per cent at the year end.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These properties, held under operating leases, are measured under the fair value model as the properties are held to earn rentals.
The majority of these non-cancellable leases have remaining non-cancellable lease terms of between 5 and 15 years.
Analysis of the nature of investment properties and leases are provided in Portfolio Statistics on page 13.
Service charge The Companys managing agents Jones Lang LaSalle manage service charge accounts for all the Companys properties.
The Company pays the service charge on any vacant units.
Service charges on rental properties are recharged to tenants.
The total service charge incurred in the year to 31 December 2011 was 6.7 million 2010: 6.1 million.
Of this figure, the service charge paid by the Group in respect of void units was 1.1 million 2010: 1.2 million.
Post Balance Sheet Events As announced in February 2012, the Company completed one transaction to purchase Emerald Park East, Emersons Green, Bristol, Gatwick Gate Industrial Estate, Crawley and Motor Park, Eastern Road, Portsmouth for 63.5 million.
This was partly financed by the drawdown of 60 million from the Barclays loan facility.
Linked to the above, an additional swap instrument was taken out for 20 million at a rate of 1.893% resulting in the drawndown amount of the Barclays loan facility being fully hedged.
