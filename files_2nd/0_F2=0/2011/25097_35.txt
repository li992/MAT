FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Currency sensitivity The below table shows the strengthening weakening of local currencies against Sterling over the financial year for the Companys financial assets and liabilities held at 31 December 2011.
1 % change Australian Dollar 0.8% Canadian Dollar 1.7% Danish Kroner 2.3% Euro 2.5% Hong Kong Dollar 0.6% Hungarian Forint 14.0% Japanese Yen 6.0% Norwegian Kroner 1.9% Swedish Kroner 1.8% Swiss Franc 0.0% Taiwanese Dollar 3.2% US Dollar 0.5% 1 Percentage change against Sterling from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 Based on the financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011 and all other things being equal, if Sterling had strengthened weakened by the changes shown above, the impact on the profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2011 and the Companys net assets at 31 December 2011 would have been as follows: Potential effect 000 Australian Dollar 44 Canadian Dollar 252 Danish Kroner 196 Euro 1,458 Hong Kong Dollar 116 Hungarian Forint 58 Japanese Yen 1,011 Norwegian Kroner 120 Swedish Kroner 221 Swiss Franc 1 Taiwanese Dollar 212 US Dollar 777 Total 568 ii Interest Rate Risk The Company is typically fully invested in global equities but will from time to time hold interest bearing assets.
These assets are cash balances that earn interest at a oating rate and UK Treasury Bills when large amounts of cash are held.
At the year end the Companys only interest bearing investment was STE Clean Recycling and Energy but a very limited amount of income is receivable on this investment.
The Company does not have interest bearing liabilities.
Interest rate sensitivity As described above, the Company had one interest bearing investment at 31 December 2011 which was valued at 975,000.
The average interest rate on this investment is 14% per annum.
Therefore, it generates annual income of 136,500.
All other things being equal, in the event of non-payment of interest from this investment, profit would be negatively impacted by the amount of this income.
iii Other Price Risk The principal price risk for the Company is the price volatility of shares that are owned by the Company.
The Company is well diversied across different sub-sectors and geographies and has a volatility level similar to global stock market indices such as the MSCI World Index to which the Company has had a tracking error of 7.8% since the inception of the Company.
The historic 3-year annualised volatility of the Company to 31 December 2011 is 19.0%.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Other price risk sensitivity At the year end the Company held investments with an aggregate market value of 342,213,000.
All other things being equal, the effect of a 10% increase or decrease in the fair values of the assets held at the year end would have been an increase or decrease of 34,221,000 in the profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2011 and the Companys net assets at 31 December 2011.
Overall Sensitivity The Manager has used the value at risk VAR methodology in UBS PAS a proprietary investment banking model to estimate the maximum expected loss from the portfolio held at 31 December 2011 over 1 day, 5 day, 10 day and 21 day time periods given the historical performance of the fund over the previous five years.
The data in the previous five years is analysed under discrete periods to provide 1 in 10, 1 in 20 and 1 in 100 possible outcomes.
The results of the analysis are shown below.
Expected loss as percentage at limit 1 in 10 90% 1 in 20 95% 1 in 100 99% 1 day return 1.4 2.0 3.6 5 day return 3.5 4.8 8.8 10 day return 4.8 6.9 13.8 21 day return 6.5 10.2 22.0 The above analysis has been based on the following main assumptions: The distribution of share price returns will be the same in the future as they were in the past.
The portfolio weightings will remain as they were at 31 December 2011.
The above results suggest, for example, that there is a 5% or less chance of the NAV falling by 4.8% or more over a 5 day period.
Similarly, there is a 1% or less chance of the NAV falling by 3.6% or more on any given day.
Credit Risks Cash at bank at 31 December 2011 included 1,118,000 2010: 4,157,000 held at the Companys custodian, The Northern Trust Company.
The Company also held 44,000 2010: 10,632,000 at Lloyds TSB Bank plc.
The Board has established guidelines that, under normal circumstances, the maximum level of cash to be held at any one bank should be the lower of i 5% of the Companys net assets and ii 15 million.
These are guidelines and there may be instances when this amount is exceeded for short periods of time.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be low as trading is almost always done on a delivery versus payment basis.
There is a credit risk on the unquoted interest bearing investment in STE Clean Recycling and Energy which was valued at 975,000 at the year.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by The Northern Trust Company the Custodian or subcustodians of the Custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian or its sub-custodians may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Custodian segregates the Companys assets from its own assets and only uses sub-custodians on its approved list of sub-custodians.
The Companys exposure to the Custodian amounts to 328.1 million in respect of quoted investments and 1.1 million in respect of cash.
The Company invests in broker issued participatory notes to provide economic exposure to underlying shares or securities when it is impracticable to invest directly in those shares or securities.
The Company may be exposed to risk of loss in the event of default or insolvency of any counter-party used to acquire such investments.
The Board has set a maximum limit for investment through participatory notes at 5% of net asset value, subject to a further limit of 2% per broker both limits at time of investment.
Liquidity Risks The Company invests in a range of global equities with different market capitalisations and liquidities and therefore needs to be conscious of liquidity risk.
The Manager monitors the liquidity risk by carrying out a Maturity Analysis of the Companys listed equities based on the 20 Day Average Liquidities of each investment and assuming one third 33.3% of the daily traded volume.
As shown in the quantitative analysis below, on 31 December 2011, 3.7% of the portfolio by value excluding unquoted investments may have taken more than three months to be realised.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Quantitative Disclosures As described above, the Manager has carried out a maturity analysis of the Companys quoted investments at 31 December 2011 and the results for different time bands are reported as follows: Percentage of portfolio by value that could be liquidated in one month 84.4% Percentage of portfolio by value that could be liquidated in three months 96.3% Percentage of portfolio by value that could be liquidated in one year 99.6% Percentage of portfolio by value that could be liquidated in five years 100.0% The Company may invest up to 10% of its net assets into pre-IPO investments which are possible candidates for otation.
At the year end the Company held investments in six unquoted companies with an aggregate total value of 14,156,000 2010: 16,641,000 : these investments have been valued at fair value at the year end.
Classication of financial instruments FRS 29 requires that the classication of financial instruments be valued by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following classications are used: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The classication of the Companys investments held at fair value is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Investments at fair value through profit and loss Quoted 322,795 5,262 328,057 412,389 10,736 423,125 Unquoted 14,156 14,156 16,641 16,641 322,795 5,262 14,156 342,213 412,389 10,736 16,641 439,766 Level 2 investments detailed above are holdings in quoted companies held through broker participatory notes.
