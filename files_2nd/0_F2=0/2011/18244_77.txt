Capital Management The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent together with net debt.
This is kept under constant review to ensure the Group has sufficient capital to fund its operations and that the Groups strategy of low gearing is maintained.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between longer-term finance appropriate to fund its long-term investment property holding strategy and cost effectiveness, given availability of debt in the market.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Net debt comprises a mix of fixed rate mortgages and shorter-term bank loans as set out in Note 16 and cash and short term deposits as set out in Note 13.
All loans and borrowings are secured against investment property and the bank loans are drawn against committed facilities.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments With the exception of floating rate loans and borrowings which have not been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, the Groups financial instruments are either recorded at fair value or their fair values are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
The fair value of the Groups floating rate loans and borrowings is as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Floating rate loans and borrowings at carrying amount 63,656 24,241 Adjustment to fair value 1,911 2,083 Floating rate loans and borrowings at fair value 61,745 22,158 The fair values of fixed rate loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments recorded in the financial statements, together with the fair values of floating rate loans and borrowings shown above, have been determined by discounting the differences between cash flows based on contractual principal and interest amounts and cash flows based on forecast market rates.
