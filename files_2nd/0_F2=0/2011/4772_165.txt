There are no further unrecognised deferred tax losses within the Group.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable recoverable within one year.
However, the Directors consider that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.
