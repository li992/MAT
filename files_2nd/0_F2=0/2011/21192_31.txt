The MCEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the MCEV Principles published by the CFO Forum in October 2009.
The directors consider that the MCEV methodology gives useful insight into the drivers of financial performance of the Groups life and related businesses.
This basis values future cash flows from assets consistently with market prices, including more explicit allowance for the impact of uncertainty in future investment returns and other risks.
Embedded value is also consistent with the way pricing is assessed and the business is managed.
The results for 2011 and 2010 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
Their report in respect of 2011 can be found on page 360 in the Report and Accounts.
Covered business The MCEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of certain life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint ventures including our associated undertakings in India, China, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.
In addition, the results of group companies providing significant administration, fund management and other services and of Group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
Avivas associate holding of Delta Lloyd is not included within covered business as MCEV is not used to manage Delta Lloyd.
For Group MCEV reporting, which includes general insurance and other non-covered business, Delta Lloyd is included on an IFRS basis.
New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sale of new contracts during the period: non-contractual additional premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
The Groups definition of new business under MCEV includes contracts that meet the definition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are considered to represent new business where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable.
For Group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Life and pensions operating earnings For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns.
The use of asset risk premia reflects managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes.
The normalised investment return on equities and property has been calculated by reference to the ten-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium.
The expected return on bonds has been calculated by reference to the swap rate consistent with the duration of the backing assets in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin expected return is equivalent to the gross redemption yield less an allowance for defaults.
The expected existing business contribution in excess of reference rate is calculated using the implied discount rate IDR, which itself is based on the normalised investment returns.
The methodology applies the IDR to the value of in force VIF and required capital RC components of the MCEV and adds to this the total expected return for free surplus FS to derive the total expected return, in a manner consistent with that previously used under European embedded value reporting.
This total is presented as the expected existing business contribution reference rate, expected existing business contribution in excess of reference rate and expected return on shareholders net worth grossed up for tax for pre-tax presentation, with only the excess contribution being impacted by the change.
The change to expected returns has no impact on total return or on the closing balance sheet.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 329 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E1 Basis of preparation continued MCEV methodology Overview Under the MCEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
Where gross results are presented, these have been calculated by grossing up post-tax results at the full rate of corporation tax for each country based on opening period tax rates, apart from the UK, where a 26% tax rate was used for 2011 for grossing up.
Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is the market value of assets attributed to the covered business over and above that required to back liabilities for covered business, for which distribution to shareholders is restricted.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity level.
The level of required capital for each business unit is generally set equal to the higher of: the level of capital at which the local regulator is empowered to take action: the capital requirement of the business unit under the Groups economic capital requirements: and the target capital level of the business unit.
For Aviva US, the required capital is set at 325% of the NAIC Company Action Level in line with management targets and target credit ratings.
This methodology reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business, and includes any additional shareholder funds not available for distribution, such as the reattributed inherited estate in the UK.
The same definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the in-force covered business at the valuation date.
The level of required capital across the business units expressed as a percentage of the EU minimum solvency margin or equivalent can be found in E18.
Value of in-force covered business VIF The value of in-force covered business consists of the following components: present value of future profits: time value of financial options and guarantees: frictional costs of required capital: and cost of residual non-hedgeable risks.
Present value of future profits PVFP The PVFP is the present value of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis.
Distributable profits generally arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with any local statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using assumptions of future experience.
Future profits are projected using best estimate non-economic assumptions and market consistent economic assumptions.
In principle, each cash flow is discounted at a rate that appropriately reflects the riskiness of that cash flow, so higher-risk cash flows are discounted at higher rates.
In practice, the PVFP is calculated using the certainty equivalent approach, under which the reference rate is used for both the investment return and the discount rate.
This approach ensures that asset cash flows are valued consistently with the market prices of assets without options and guarantees.
Further information on the risk-free rates is given in note E18.
The PVFP includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
330 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E1 Basis of preparation continued Time value of financial options and guarantees TVOG The PVFP calculation is based on a single base economic scenario: however, a single scenario cannot appropriately allow for the effect of certain product features.
If an option or guarantee affects shareholder cash flows in the base scenario, the impact is included in the PVFP and is referred to as the intrinsic value of the option guarantee: however, future investment returns are uncertain and the actual impact on shareholder profits may be higher or lower.
The value of in-force business needs to be adjusted for the impact of the range of potential future outcomes.
Stochastic modelling techniques can be used to assess the impact of potential future outcomes, and the difference between the intrinsic value and the total stochastic value is referred to as the time value of the option or guarantee TVOG.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Under a market consistent approach, the economic scenarios generated reflect the markets tendency towards risk aversion.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
Stochastic models are calibrated to market yield curves and volatility levels at the valuation date.
Tests are performed to confirm that the scenarios used produce results that replicate the market price of traded instruments.
Where evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, dynamic lapse assumptions are set that vary depending on the individual scenarios.
This cost is included in the TVOG.
Dynamic lapses are modelled for parts of the UK, US and French businesses.
Asymmetries in non-economic assumptions that are linked to economic scenarios, but that have insufficient evidence for credible dynamic assumptions, are allowed for within mean best estimate assumptions.
Frictional costs of required capital The additional costs to a shareholder of holding the assets backing required capital within an insurance company rather than directly in the market are called frictional costs.
They are explicitly deducted from the PVFP.
The additional costs allowed for are the taxation costs and any additional investment expenses on the assets backing the required capital.
The level of required capital has been set out above in the net worth section.
Frictional costs are calculated by projecting forwards the future levels of required capital.
Tax on investment return and investment expenses are payable on the assets backing required capital, up until the point that they are released to shareholders.
Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR The cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR covers risks not already allowed for in the TVOG or the PVFP.
The allowance includes the impact of both non-hedgeable financial and non-financial risks.
The most significant risk not included in the PVFP or TVOG is operational risk.
Asymmetric risks allowed for in the TVOG or PVFP are described earlier in the basis of preparation.
No allowance has been made within the cost of non-hedgeable risk for symmetrical risks as these are diversifiable by investors.
US capital solutions Credit has been taken within the US embedded value, and value of new business, for the anticipated reduction in capital requirements based on managements intention to enact transactions which allow recognition of additional assets that can be held against certain reserves, reducing shareholder capital requirements.
By the end of 2011 transactions have been enacted for business written from 2006 to 2011.
US new business tax US new business has been valued on a basis with tax applied at the full corporation rate and consequential movements in the value of the Deferred Tax Asset included as a variance within existing business operating return.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future market-consistent returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the TVOG.
For profit-sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, the apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders and shareholders reflect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Under certain economic scenarios where additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the TVOG.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 331 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E1 Basis of preparation continued The embedded value of the US spread-based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees.
This includes the ability to change the crediting rates and indexed strategies available within the policy.
Consideration is taken of the economic environment assumed in future projections and returns in excess of the reference rate are not assumed.
Anticipated market and policyholder reaction to management action has been considered.
Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between Group life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements have been included in the results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the MCEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non-insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the MCEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and value of new business calculations for the relevant business, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non-insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing statement of financial positions, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
The assessments of goodwill, intangibles and pension schemes relating to life insurance business utilise the IFRS measurement basis.
Exchange rates The Groups principal overseas operations during the period were located within the eurozone and the US.
The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated at the average rates for that period and the assets and liabilities have been translated at the period end rates.
Please refer to note 1 on page 191 of the IFRS financial statements.
Restatement The 2010 opening and closing embedded values have been restated for the US, primarily reflecting modelling corrections to the valuation of certain life contracts and an overstatement of asset income identified in 2011.
The resulting impact of the restatement was that the opening 2010 embedded value increased by 12 million and the closing 2010 embedded value reduced by 257 million, with no impact on operating profit.
Impact of Delta Lloyd disposal On 6 May 2011, the Group sold 25 million shares in Delta Lloyd N. V. Delta Lloyd the Groups Dutch long-term insurance, general insurance and fund management subsidiary, reducing our holding to approximately 43% of Delta Lloyds ordinary share capital.
In line with IFRS, up to the date of partial disposal, Delta Lloyd has been presented as a discontinued operation.
Following the partial disposal, when Delta Lloyd became an associate of Aviva, Delta Lloyd has been removed from covered business as it is not managed by either Aviva or Delta Lloyd on an MCEV basis.
The impact on MCEV as at 6 May 2011 is a reduction of 1,519 million.

Value of new business grew 7% to 380 million 2010: 354 million due to our focus on value maximisation through active management of our new business mix, robust cost control and pricing discipline.
Total expected return decreased by 9% to 701 million 2010: 773 million as a result of a lower opening implied discount rate, albeit on a higher embedded value.
Experience variances of 116 million 2010: 20 million adverse primarily reflect benefits from the Part VII transfer of the former RBS JV business, partly offset by 30 million adverse project expenditures due to increased level of regulatory change.
Assumption changes were 11 million adverse 2010: 18 million adverse reflecting the strengthening of mortality and morbidity rates.
Aviva Europe MCEV operating earnings decreased 20% to 1,617 million 2010: 2,013 million as operating variances and assumption changes were less favourable than in the prior period.
Additionally, our lower new business volumes, as a result of our focus on value over volume, have led to a corresponding decline in the value of new business.
Value of new business was 27% lower at 369 million 2010: 504 million following lower sales in Spain and management action to reduce sales of profit-sharing products in Italy and, to a lesser extent, in France.
Total expected return increased by 5% to 792 million 2010: 753 million due to increased yields on shareholders net worth.
Experience variances were favourable at 41 million 2010: 147 million following positive mortality and other experience across the region, partly offset by adverse expenses in France and Ireland and lapse experience in Ireland.
Assumption changes on existing business were favourable at 178 million 2010: 338 million primarily reflecting positive impact of changes to mortality and lapse assumptions in France and changes to assumed expense levels and management actions in relation to product charges in Poland, offset by adverse impacts of lapse and expense changes in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Other Europe.
Other operating variances were positive at 237 million 2010: 271 million.
These largely arose in France and relate to modelling refinements of 324 million, offset by adverse modelling refinements in Italy of 110 million.

Value of new business of negative 131 million 2010: 194 million negative reflects the continuing adverse economic environment with low risk-free rates.
The year on year improvement results from product actions, together with assumption and modelling changes, that more than offset adverse economic movements.
Total expected return increased by 27% to 641 million 2010: 503 million reflecting a higher implied discount rate.
Operating experience and assumption changes on existing business were 213 million adverse 2010: 153 million adverse reflecting adverse expense and mortality experience, the strengthening of future expense assumptions and revisions to policyholder behaviour and annuity spread assumptions.
Other operating variances were 56 million adverse 2010: 133 million favourable, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of new business on the value of deferred tax losses.
Asia Pacific MCEV operating earnings were 28% lower at 78 million 2010: 109 million as the higher value of new business was more than offset by lower expected return and adverse impacts of existing business.
Value of new business was 37% higher at 71 million 2010: 52 million, reflecting improved scale efficiencies, product mix and volumes.
Total expected return decreased by 26% to 42 million 2010: 57 million, as a result of lower implied discount rates.
Operating experience variances, other operating variances and assumption changes on existing business were adverse 35 million 2010: nil, primarily reflecting adverse lapse experience and assumption strengthening.
2 Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumption set across a number of our businesses, most notably in France.
Adverse experience reflects normal volatility in mortality and increased retention limits in the US.
3 Persistency experience continues to be somewhat volatile across our businesses.
Asia reflects an accumulation of small adverse experience across businesses.
4 Other experience includes tax benefits from the transfer of former RBS joint venture business into the long-term fund in the UK.
5 Maintenance and project expense assumptions have been revised in many regions with a broadly neutral impact on continuing business and a benefit from restructuring in Delta Lloyd.
6 Mortality assumptions have been updated in France reflecting experience.
7 Persistency assumptions have been updated in a number of businesses reflecting lower expected lapses in France AFER, increases due to the economic environment in Ireland and Spain and, in the US, revisions to dynamic policyholder lapse behaviour.
8 Other operating assumption changes in Poland relate to a change to assumed management actions in relation to product charges, and, in the US, revisions to policyholder utilisation of rider benefits offset by revisions to annuity spread assumptions.
9 Other operating variances relate to modelling changes and the release of a modelling provision in France, and modelling refinements in Italy, and in the US, the marginal impact of new business on the value of deferred tax losses, with cost of capital transactions and model refinements broadly offsetting.

2 Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumption set across a number of our businesses, most notably in France and the UK Annuity business.
3 Persistency experience remains volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting the wider economic circumstances.
In France, persistency experience reflects a release of the short-term provision.
4 Other experience includes, in France, the benefit from policyholders switching to unit-linked funds and, in the USA, favourable spread experience.
5 Favourable maintenance expense assumptions reflect the benefit of the shared service centre in Spain, together with the release of margins in Spain, related to bancassurance joint venture governance costs, and Poland.
In the UK, the expense assumptions include a reallocation of provisions in the service company, better reflecting the expected future allocation of costs.
In the USA, the adverse impact reflects a revised allocation of costs between ongoing and one-off.
In Delta Lloyd, favourable expense assumptions relate to planned expense saving following restructuring activities.
6 Delta Lloyd has updated mortality assumptions to reflect recently published tables, which include a significantly increased allowance for mortality improvements.
In France and the USA, mortality assumptions have been updated reflecting experience.
7 Persistency assumptions have been updated in a number of businesses.
8 Other operating variances for France relate to modelling changes, particularly relating to the time value of options and guarantees, and the benefit of reducing minimum guarantee rates.

For full year 2010, exceptional items were mainly due to a change in the cost of capital charge for the Cost of Non-Hedgeable Risk, from 2.5% to 3.3% p. a. with total impact of 365 million, the impact of reducing state contributions to Pillar II Pension funds in Poland, following the announcement to change legislation on 1 April 2011 of 280 million, and the recognition by Delta Lloyd of 59 million costs in relation to unit-linked insurance compensation scheme and compensation costs in defined contribution pension schemes, partly offset by a 286 million benefit from the closure of the final salary section of the UK staff pension scheme to future accruals.
Integration and restructuring costs incurred in the year amounted to 212 million FY10: 312 million.
This includes costs associated with preparing the businesses for Solvency II implementation of 88 million expenditure relating to the Quantum Leap project in Europe of 51 million, and other restructuring exercises across the Group of 91 million partly offset by benefits of regulatory changes of 20 million.

Since the look through into service companies includes only future profits and losses, these amounts must be eliminated from the closing embedded value.
4 As a result of the January 2012 announced disposal of the Czech, Hungarian, and Romanian businesses, the VIF movement reflects the write-down of this business to the IFRS carrying value.
Divested business is the removal of Delta Lloyd from covered business subsequent to the reduction of our holding to 42%.

The life and pensions MCEV operating earnings comprise: the value of new business written during the year: the earnings from existing business including other operating variances: and the expected investment return on the shareholders net worth.
These components are calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year in-force business or start of the quarter new business and operating demographic and expenses assumptions as at the end of the year.

The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the period plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate the value of new business, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
The weighted average capitalisation factor WACF is the multiple of the annualised regular premium which gives the present value at point of sale of the regular premiums.

This business had a high WACF, reflecting the long duration of the business combined with premiums increasing each year.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 343 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E10 Geographical analysis of value of new business The tables below set out the present value of new business premiums PVNBP written by the life and related businesses, the value of the new business and the resulting margin, firstly gross and then net of tax and non-controlling interests.
The value generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after-tax distributable profit from that business, including expected profit between point of sale and the valuation date.
The value of new business has been calculated using economic assumptions at the point of sale which has been implemented with the assumptions being taken as those appropriate to the start of each quarter.
For contracts that are re-priced more frequently, weekly or monthly economic assumptions have been used.
The operating assumptions are consistent with those used to determine the embedded value.
The value of new business is shown after the effect of the frictional costs of holding required capital, and after the effect of the costs of residual non-hedgeable risks on the same basis as for the in-force covered business.
344 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E11 Post-tax internal rate of return and payback period on life and pensions new business The new business written requires up-front capital investment due to high set-up costs and capital requirements.
The internal rate of return IRR is a measure of the shareholder return expected on this capital investment.
It is equivalent to the discount rate at which the present value of the post-tax cash flows expected to be earned over the lifetime of the business written, including allowance for the time value of options and guarantees, is equal to the total invested capital to support the writing of the business.
The capital included in the calculation of the IRR is the initial capital required to pay acquisition costs and set up statutory reserves in excess of premiums received initial capital, plus required capital at the same level as for the calculation of the value of new business.
The payback period shows how quickly shareholders can expect the total capital to be repaid.
The payback period has been calculated based on undiscounted cash flows and allows for the initial and required capital.
The projected investment returns in both the IRR and payback period calculations assume that equities, properties and bonds earn a return in excess of risk-free consistent with the long-term rate of return assumed in operating earnings.
The IRR on life and pensions new business for the Group excluding Delta Lloyd was 14.4% 2010: 13.3%.

350 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E18 Principal assumptions a Economic assumptions deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible, used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank.
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities.
For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield curve the relevant government bond yields are used.
For certain business, swap rates are adjusted for a liquidity premium in deriving the risk-free rates, and these adjustments are shown below the reference rate table.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent.
The principal economic assumptions used are as follows: Reference rate spot, swap rates and expense inflation United Kingdom 2011 2010 2009 Reference rate 1 year 1.2% 1.0% 1.2% 5 years 1.6% 2.7% 3.5% 10 years 2.3% 3.7% 4.3% 15 years 2.8% 4.1% 4.6% 20 years 3.0% 4.2% 4.6% Expense inflation 2.8% 3.3% 3.3% Delta Lloyd 2011 2010 2009 Reference rate 1 year n a 1.3% 1.3% 5 years n a 2.6% 2.9% 10 years n a 3.4% 3.7% 15 years n a 3.8% 4.1% 20 years n a 3.8% 4.2% Expense inflation n a 2.0% 2.4% Eurozone excluding Delta Lloyd 2011 2010 2009 Reference rate 1 year 1.4% 1.3% 1.3% 5 years 1.7% 2.5% 2.8% 10 years 2.4% 3.4% 3.7% 15 years 2.8% 3.8% 4.1% 20 years 2.8% 3.8% 4.2% Expense inflation 1.9% 2.1% 2.5% Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 351 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E18 Principal assumptions continued Poland 2011 2010 2009 Reference rate 1 year 4.9% 4.4% 4.5% 5 years 4.8% 5.5% 5.8% 10 years 5.0% 5.7% 5.8% 15 years 4.7% 5.4% 5.7% 20 years 4.3% 5.1% 5.5% Expense inflation 2.9% 3.0% 3.0% United States 2011 2010 2009 Reference rate 1 year 0.7% 0.4% 0.7% 5 years 1.2% 2.2% 3.1% 10 years 2.1% 3.5% 4.2% 15 years 2.5% 4.0% 4.6% 20 years 2.6% 4.2% 4.8% Expense inflation 2.0% 3.0% 3.0% For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company.
The following adjustments are made to the swap rate for immediate annuity type contracts and for all contracts for Aviva USA.
For participating contracts, 75% of this value is used and for all other contracts, 50% of this value is used.
This methodology is consistent with QIS 5 Solvency II requirements.
The approach to estimating the market level of liquidity premium in corporate bond assets is consistent with the formula structure proposed by the CFO CRO Forum working party.
The formula is: UK Europe: 50% of iBoxx Corporate bond spread 40bp USA: 60% of iBoxx Corporate bond spread 40bp Adjustments are made where liabilities are not fully backed by assets earning a liquidity premium and for contracts that are exposed to some lapse risk.
There has been no change to the types of contracts to which a liquidity premium is applied.
Risk premium used for operating profit, implied discount rates IDR, internal rates of return IRR and payback period For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns.
The normalised investment returns are expressed as a swap rate based on the typical duration of the assets held plus an asset risk premium.
More detail is given in note E1 Basis of preparation.
The use of asset risk premia only impacts operating earnings as expected returns reflect managements long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the reference rate from investing in different asset classes.
This assumption does not impact the embedded value or value of new business as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned.
The asset risk premia set out in the table below are added to the ten-year swap rate to calculate expected returns.

In addition, the reattribution of the inherited estate has led to additional capital being locked in to support the with-profit business, and this has been included within required capital.
2 Required capital in Ireland under MCEV is 174% for bancassurance and 180% for retail business.
3 This is the aggregate required capital level in Italy.
The required capital as a percentage of EU minimum has increased due to the current economic environment.
4 Required capital in Spain is 156% of the EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 122%130% for bancassurance companies.
5 Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes in future tax rates have been substantively enacted as at the valuation date.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted in March 2011 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
A further reduction from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted in July 2011 and will be effective from 1 April 2012.
The effect of the 25% rate has been reflected in the Groups MCEV net assets as at 31 December 2011.
In addition, the Government announced its intention to further reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 24% from 1 April 2013 and to 23% from 1 April 2014.
The benefit to the Groups MCEV net assets from the further 2% reduction in the rate from 25% to 23% is estimated at approximately 100 million in total.
Considerable changes to the regime for taxing UK life insurance companies will be made with effect from 1 January 2013.
Draft legislation on this was included in the draft 2012 Finance Bill published on 6 December 2011, and consultation on the changes and the draft legislation has continued since then.
Based on the draft legislation published in December 2011 and the continued consultation, it is not expected that these changes will have a material impact on the Groups MCEV net assets.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is generally assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Where the fund is insufficient and additional shareholder support is required, this is included within required capital, including the RIEESA in the UK.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the UK and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
b Economic assumptions stochastic calculations The calculation of time value of options and guarantees allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix, bonus rates and rates of interest and other guarantees granted to policyholders.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 353 Aviva plc MCEV financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 E18 Principal assumptions continued Model Europe excluding Delta Lloyd and Asia Pacific Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model LMM, that projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Forward rates are assumed to have a log-normal distribution which guarantees non-negative interest rates.
The model is calibrated to at-themoney swaptions of a variety of terms and tenors.
Swaption volatilities are taken from SuperDerivatives.
Tests have been performed to ensure that sufficient scenarios have been used that the result converges to the stochastic value of the business being valued.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year swaps plus an excess return.
This excess return is generally modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
This allows the model to capture the term structure of implied volatilities.
The model is calibrated to at-the-money options of a variety of terms.
Option volatilities are taken from Markit.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
In the absence of liquid market data, the volatilities of these asset classes are based on historic data.
Assumptions for correlations between asset classes have been set based on historic data.
Model North America and United Kingdom Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model Plus LMM, which projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals.
Previously the LMM model was used in the UK to generate scenarios.
Forward rates are assumed to have a distribution that lies between the log-normal and normal distributions.
Although this no longer guarantees non-negative interest rates, it maintains interest rates within a more plausible range than the standard Libor Market Model, and gives a better fit to certain swaption volatility surfaces.
The model is calibrated to volatilities for swaptions for ten-year swaps for a range of option terms and strike rates.
For the US, this excess return is modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon.
For the UK, a two-dimensional model is used to capture the term structure of implied volatilities and the projected in the money position.
Model Delta Lloyd The interest rate model used is a short rate G2 model.
The model is calibrated to the QIS5 yield curve and the swaption implied volatilities.
Swaption implied volatilities are taken from Bloomberg.
The equity model is a Heston model.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds.
The most significant assumptions are the distribution of future long-term interest rates nominal and real and swaption implied volatilities.
For many businesses, including US, France and Delta Lloyd, the most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various durations.
Summary statistics Swaption implied volatilities The implied volatility is that determined by Black-Scholes formula to reproduce the market price of the option.
The following table sets out the swaption implied volatilities.
The following table sets out the model equity implied volatilities.
For the UK, model property implied volatility is 15% for 31 December 2011 31 December 2010: 15%.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience with a view to giving a best estimate of future experience.
We have anticipated future changes in experience where that is appropriate, e. g. we have allowed for improvements in future policyholder longevity.
We have set the assumptions based on a best estimate of shareholder outcomes.
In particular, where the policyholder behaviour varies with economic experience, we have set assumptions which are dynamic, i. e. vary depending on the economic assumptions.
For example, surrender and option take-up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Additionally, where demographic experience is not driven by economic scenarios but is asymmetric on a standalone basis, the best estimate assumption considers the weighted-average expected experience, not simply the median or most likely outcome.
Notwithstanding the notification on 15 December 2011 that the bancassurance distribution agreement with Allied Irish Bank was not being renewed, the Aviva Ireland demographic assumptions have been set assuming the business remains open to new business and does not incur diseconomies of scale or other operating impacts.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the MCEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to our life businesses, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and value of new business.
Non-hedgeable risk For the balance sheet and operating profit, a charge of 3.3% has been applied to the group-diversified capital required on a 1-in-200 one-year basis over the remaining lifetime of in-force business.
The charge is set so as to give an aggregate allowance that is in excess of the expected operational risk costs arising from the in-force covered business over its remaining lifetime.
The capital levels used are projected to be sufficient to cover non-hedgeable risks at the 99.5% confidence level one-year after the valuation date.
The capital is equal to the capital from the ICA results for those risks considered.
The capital has been projected as running off over the remaining life of the in-force portfolio in line with the drivers of the capital requirement.
In addition to the operational risk allowance, financial non-hedgeable risks and other product level asymmetries have been allowed for.
These allowances are not material as significant financial non-hedgeable risks and product level asymmetries are either modelled explicitly and included in the TVOG or are included in the PVFP through the use of appropriate best estimate assumptions.

E19 Sensitivity analysis a Economic assumptions The following tables show the sensitivity of the embedded value and the value of new business to: 10 basis point increase in the liquidity premium adjustment, where applicable: one percentage point increase and decrease in the risk-free rate, including all consequential changes including assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 10% increase and decrease in market values of equity and property assets: 25% increase in equity and swaption volatilities: 50 basis point increase and decrease in credit spreads with no change to liquidity premium: and decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.
Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances.
Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are allowed for where an active valuation basis is used.
Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed.
For new business, the sensitivities reflect the impact of a change immediately after inception of the policy.
In general, the magnitude of the sensitivities will reflect the size of the embedded values, though this will vary as the sensitivities have different impacts on the different components of the embedded value.
In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
The credit spread sensitivities assume that the change relates to credit risk and not liquidity risk: in practice, credit spread movements may be partially offset due to changes in liquidity risk.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.

The calculated sensitivity uses the ECB AAA and other curve in place of the reference rate for liabilities in Italy and Spain and results in an increase of 0.6 billion to the embedded value of 12.3 billion.

Where there is a look through into service company expenses the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% p. a. would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% p. a. : and 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business.
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation all other assumptions remain unchanged.
No changes to valuation bases have been included.
