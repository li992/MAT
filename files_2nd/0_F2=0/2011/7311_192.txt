6 dISCONTINUEd OPERATIONS Uganda On 18 December 2009, Heritage announced that it and its wholly owned subsidiary HOGL, had entered into a SPA with Eni for the sale of the Ugandan Assets.
On 17 January 2010, Tullow exercised its rights of pre-emption.
The transaction was overwhelmingly approved by Heritage shareholders at the General Meeting on 25 January 2010.
On 27 July 2010, Heritage announced that HOGL had completed the disposal of the Ugandan Assets.
Tullow paid cash of $1.45 billion, including $100 million from a contractual settlement, of which Heritage received and retained $1.045 billion.
heritage oil plc Financial Statements 20 24 6 dISCONTINUEd OPERATIONS C ONTI N U E d The URA contends that income tax is due on the capital gain arising on the disposal and it raised assessments of $404,925,000 prior to completion of the disposal.
Heritages position, based on comprehensive advice from leading legal and tax experts in Uganda, the United Kingdom and North America, is that no tax should be payable in Uganda on the disposal of the Ugandan Assets.
On closing, Heritage deposited $121,477,500 with the URA, representing 30% of the disputed tax assessment of $404,925,000.
$121,477,500 has been classified as a deposit in the balance sheet at 31 December 2011.
A further $283,447,000 has been retained in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London, pursuant to an agreement between HOGL, Tullow and Standard Chartered Bank pending resolution between the Ugandan Government and HOGL of the tax dispute.
Including accrued interest, an amount of $284,479,000 is classified as restricted cash in the balance sheet at 31 December 2011.
In August 2010, the URA issued a further income tax assessment of $30 million representing 30% of the additional contractual settlement amount of $100 million.
HOGL has challenged the Ugandan tax assessments on the disposal of HOGLs entire interest in the Ugandan Assets.
In November 2011 and December 2011, the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Uganda dismissed HOGLs applications in relation to the two assessments amounting to $434,925,000.
In December 2011 and January 2012, HOGL commenced appeals to the Ugandan High Court in relation to the rulings from the Tax Appeals Tribunal.
The rulings from the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Uganda are part of a domestic process and are not final and determinative.
HOGL has appealed the rulings, which it believes are fatally flawed in many respects, through the Ugandan court system commencing with the High Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court if necessary.
As a result of the actions of the tax authorities in Uganda, HOGL and its advisers consider that it was compelled to take part in a Ugandan domestic process before a Tax Appeals Tribunal, notwithstanding HOGLs belief that arbitration, which is ongoing in London and detailed below, is the correct forum to settle such disputes, in view of the existence of valid and binding arbitration provisions in its PSAs with the Ugandan Government.
In May 2011, HOGL commenced international arbitration proceedings in London against the Ugandan Government.
HOGL is seeking a decision requiring, among other things, the return or release of approximately $405 million, plus interest, in aggregate currently on deposit with the URA or in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London.
Accordingly, the arbitration proceedings concern HOGLs claims that the Ugandan Government wrongfully or unreasonably withheld consent to the sale by HOGL of the rights under the PSAs for the Ugandan Assets, including by making this consent conditional upon the payment of a sum alleged to be a tax liability of HOGL.
The arbitration proceedings are being held in London in accordance with the provisions of the PSAs in relation to the Ugandan Assets.
On 15 April 2011, Heritage and its wholly owned subsidiary HOGL received Particulars of Claim filed in the High Court of Justice in England by Tullow seeking $313,447,500 for alleged breach of contract as a result of HOGLs and Heritages refusal to reimburse Tullow in relation to a payment made by Tullow of $313,447,500 on 7 April 2011 to the URA.
Heritage and HOGL believe that the claim has no basis and are in the process of vigorously and robustly defending it.
Heritage and HOGL have filed their Defence and Counterclaim against Tullow seeking instead the release to HOGL of the $283,447,000 plus interest currently being held in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London.
Although disputes of this nature are inherently uncertain, the Directors believe that the monies on deposit and held in escrow will ultimately be recovered by Heritage.
The results of the Ugandan operations have been classified as discontinued operations.
