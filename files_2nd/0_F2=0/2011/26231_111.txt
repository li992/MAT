OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 147 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES Under current IFRS requirements, participating investment contract liabilities are measured using local GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4.
In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
Non-participating investment contracts are unit linked contracts.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the Groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the period less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.
