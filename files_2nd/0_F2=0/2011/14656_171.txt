A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 250.2m August 2010: 92.4m of such losses, which are expected to be utilised against future profit streams within the Group.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 18.7m August 2010: 191.0m of losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Current legislation deems that these losses may be carried forward for an unlimited number of years.
The 2011 Budget on 23 March 2011 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 23% over a period of four years from 2011.
The first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011 was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, and further reductions to 26% effective from 1 April 2011 and 25% effective from 1 April 2012 were substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and 5 July 2011 respectively.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 20 August 2011 has been calculated based on the rate of 25% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax asset accordingly.
