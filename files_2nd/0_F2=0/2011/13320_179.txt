Financial statements Notes to the accounts Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next ten years.
Self-insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks.
The group has historically self-insured its risks but during the latter part of 2008, other than for third party motor liability and workers compensation in the USA and the global property damage business interruption, this practice was stopped and these became fully covered in the insurance market.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses together with amounts set aside to cover certain legal and regulatory claims.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.
The above provisions have been discounted where appropriate using discount rates of 0.3% to 2.0% 2010: 1.7% to 3.5% for the UK, 1.1% 2010: 2.9% for Europe and 1.8% 2010: 2.9% for the USA.

The cost of borrowing under the RCF at the year end was 2.1%.
The groups RCF, bank borrowings and bonds are held at amortised cost.
The 300 million bond was revalued for changes in interest rates during the period March 2006 to April 2009, during which the group paid floating interest rates.
At the end of this period, the group reverted to paying fixed interest rates and revaluation of the bond ceased as the hedge relationship ended.
The bond is recorded in the financial statements at amortised cost and revaluation differences are amortised to the consolidated income statement over the life of the bond thus producing the effective rate indicated above.
