26 Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of public listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in note 17 in respect of debenture stocks.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities including derivatives held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective include: risk diversification no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in unlisted securities, excluding private equity investments, and no single investment maybe made which exceeds 10% of the value of the portfolio at the time of acquisition: currency exposure borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies: and gearing-borrowings including the debentures value at market value should not normally exceed 20% of shareholders funds.
Options may only be written on quoted stocks and the total nominal exposure is limited to a maximum of 5% of the UK portfolio at the time of investment for both put and call options.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deeds, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be short or long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2011 Average 2010 US Dollar 1.5541 1.6065 1.5657 Euro 1.19720 1.1520 1.16705 Yen 119.5725 127.8353 126.9821 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2011 2010 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 874 502 234 819 182 26 Capital Return 81,194 28,932 9,686 67,575 32,986 11,660 Total Return 82,068 29,434 9,920 68,394 33,168 11,686 NAV per share pence 13.90 4.99 1.68 11.21 5.44 1.92 56 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued 2011 2010 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue Return 874 502 234 819 182 26 Capital Return 81,194 28,932 9,686 67,575 32,986 11,660 Total Return 82,068 29,434 9,920 68,394 33,168 11,686 NAV per share pence 13.90 4.99 1.68 11.21 5.44 1.92 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
Interest Rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2010 2011 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash Borrowings Overdrafts 17,916 17,916 69,412 69,412 Exposure to fixed rates Cash Debentures 110,575 110,575 110,575 110,575 Other borrowings 175,501 175,501 102,251 102,251 Net exposures At year end 193,417 110,575 303,992 171,663 110,575 282,238 Maximum in year 233,966 110,575 344,541 171,663 110,575 282,238 Minimum in year 135,179 110,575 245,754 26,049 110,575 136,624 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rates applying on the debenture stocks are set out in note 17 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debenture on which the interest rate is fixed.
The debentures are valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2011 2010 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 179 179 694 694 Capital return 179 179 694 694 Total return 358 358 1,388 1,388 NAV per share pence 0.06 0.06 0.23 0.23 Report and Accounts 2011 57 Notes on the Accounts continued 26 Financial Risk Management continued Other Market Risk exposures The portfolio of investments, valued at 2,228,118,000 at 31 December 2011 2010: 2,422,258,000 is therefore exposed to market price changes.
The Manager assesses these exposures at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews overall exposures at each meeting against indices and other relevant information.
An analysis of the portfolio by country and major industrial sector is set out in note 16 on the accounts.
Derivative contracts entered into during the year comprise options written in the expectation that they will not be exercised.
These contracts are not connected to the maintenance or enhancement of the of the Companys investments.
Based on the portfolio of investments held at each Balance Sheet date, and assuming other factors remain constant, a decrease or increase in the fair values of the portfolio by 20% would have had the following approximate effects on the net capital return attributable to equity shareholders and on the NAV: 2011 2010 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in value in value in value in value 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement capital return 445,624 445,624 484,457 484,457 NAV per share pence 75.49 75.49 79.40 79.40 b Liquidity risk exposure The Company is required to raise funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments, private equity investments and share buybacks.
These funds may be raised either through the realisation of assets or through increased borrowing.
The risk of the Company not having sufficient liquidity at any time is not considered by the Board to be significant, given: the large number of quoted investments held in the Companys portfolio 496 at 31 December 2011 : the liquid nature of the portfolio of investments: the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio see note 16 and the existence of ongoing overdraft and loan facility agreements.
Cash balances are held with approved banks, usually on overnight deposit.
The manager reviews liquidity at the time of making each investment decision.
The Board reviews liquidity exposure at each meeting.
The Company has loan facilities of 175m as set out in note 14 on the accounts.
The 11.25% Debenture Stock is governed by a trust deed and is redeemable in 2014 or at an earlier date or dates at the Companys behest.
The Perpetual Debenture Stock is also governed by a trust deed and is redeemable at par only on the security becoming enforceable.
The Board does not therefore consider the repayment of these debenture stocks as a likely short-term liquidity issue.
At 31 December 2011 the Company had 142 million outstanding commitments to private equity investments, payable over more than one year see note 24.
The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at each balance sheet date, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2011 Current liabilities Overdrafts 17,916 17,916 Other borrowings 175,501 175,501 Other creditors 2,115 2,115 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 195,532 110,575 306,107 Interest payable on debentures 12,399 24,798 37,197 195,532 12,399 135,373 343,304 58 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC 26 Financial Risk Management continued More than three Three months months but less More than or less than one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 2010 Current liabilities Overdrafts 69,412 69,412 Other borrowings 102,251 102,251 Other creditors 3,480 3,480 Long-term liabilities Debentures 110,575 110,575 175,143 110,575 285,718 Interest payable on debentures 12,399 37,197 49,596 175,143 12,399 147,772 335,314 c Credit Risk and counterparty exposure The Company is exposed to potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities for which the Company has paid, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered.
The Board approves all counterparties used in such transactions, which must be settled on the basis of delivery against payment except where local market conditions do not permit.
A list of pre-approved counterparties is maintained by the Manager and regularly reviewed by the Board.
Broker counterparties are selected based on a combination of criteria, including credit rating, balance sheet strength and membership of a relevant regulatory body.
The rate of default in the past has been negligible.
Payments in respect of private equity investments are made only to counterparties with whom a contracted commitment exists.
Cash and deposits are held with approved banks.
The Company has an ongoing contract with its Custodian for the provision of custody services.
The contract was reviewed and updated in 2010.
Details of securities held in custody on behalf of the Company are received and reconciled monthly.
The Company has a separate agreement with the Custodian, covering stock lending arrangements.
Details of stocks on loan and collateral held, and the income derived from stock lending activities, are received and reviewed regularly for compliance with rules set out in the agreement see note 11.
To the extent that F&C carries out management and administrative duties or causes similar duties to be carried out by third parties on the Companys behalf, the Company is exposed to counterparty risk.
The Board assesses this risk continuously through regular meetings with the management of F&C including the Fund Manager and with F&Cs Internal Audit function.
In reaching its conclusions, the Board also reviews F&Cs parent groups annual Audit and Assurance Faculty Report, Group Accounts and other public information indicative of its financial position and performance.
The Company had no credit-rated bonds or similar securities in its portfolio at the year end 2010: none and does not normally invest in them.
None of the Companys financial liabilities are past their due date or impaired.
In summary, compared to the amounts included in the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2011 2010 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet exposure sheet exposure Current liabilities 000s 000s 000s 000s Derivative financial instruments 11,630 Report and Accounts 2011 59
