As a result of the reduction in the corporation tax rate by 1% to 25%, which is expected to take effect from 1st April 2013, the group tax charge is estimated to reduce next year by approximately 500,000.
Similar reductions in the group tax rate are expected to be made in the following two years if the corporation tax rate reductions are enacted as proposed.
This can either be taken as a contribution to a pension scheme or as cash.
Benefits include company cars or cash alternative, private telephone and private health insurance.
There were no directors share options outstanding at any time during the year or the previous year.
For the pension contributions above not taken as cash, the contributions have been paid by the Company to the personal pension plans of the directors for the relevant periods, except for G McFarland, where the amounts paid are those to the Companys defined contribution scheme, in which he participates.

There is no difference between the weighted average earnings per share and the basic and diluted earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share figures exclude the exceptional items.
Additions to assets in the course of construction of 6,896,000 2010 429,000 comprise 2,420,000 2010 95,000 for freehold land and buildings and 4,476,000 2010 334,000 for plant and equipment.
Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
2011 2010 The analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 000 000 Acquisition of itp GmbH 3,120 2,372 Acquisition of Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 84.8% 1,784 1,784 Acquisition of Renishaw Mayfield S. A.

These calculations use cash flow projections with assumptions as follows: itp GmbH part of the metrology reportable segment - actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5% for 5 years with a nil growth rate to perpetuity 2010 same basis.
Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, PulseTeq Limited, Renishaw Mayfield S. A. all in the healthcare reportable segment, Measurement Devices Limited and MTT Investments Limited both in the metrology reportable segment - 5-year business plans with a nil growth rate to perpetuity 2010 same basis for those applicable.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows of itp GmbH 2010 12%, Measurement Devices Limited and MTT Investments Limited.
A pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 2010 15%, PulseTeq Limited 2010 15% and Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
These have been set on the basis of these being appropriate rates for a market participant.
On this basis, no impairment write-downs are required.
There is significant headroom in all the above and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.
An increase in 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment.

In respect of part of the shareholding acquired, there may be an additional payment based on the earnings of MDL in the financial year ended 31st December 2011.
The shareholders agreement provides Renishaw with the option to purchase the remaining 51% shareholding in three tranches of 17% each in May 2012, May 2013 and May 2014.
The price per share to be paid is calculated as 7 times earnings before interest and tax, with a minimum price per share of 2 and a maximum price per share of 8.94.
An estimate of the outstanding purchase price, based on MDLs 3-year forecast, is provided for within the financial statements.

EmployEE bEnEfits The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
In 2007, this scheme, along with the Irish defined benefit scheme, ceased any future accrual for current members and both were closed to new members.
UK and Irish employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out at September 2009 and updated to 30th June 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the UK and Irish schemes were: 30th June 2011 30th June 2010 30th June 2009 UK scheme irish scheme UK scheme Irish scheme UK scheme Irish scheme 3.4% 2.4% Rate of increase in pension payments 3.3% 2.4% 3.3% 2.5% 5.5% 4.9% Discount rate 5.3% 4.4% 6.2% 5.5% 3.6% 2.4% Inflation rate RPI 3.4% 2.4% 3.4% 2.5% 2.9% - Inflation rate CPI - - - - 8.3% 7.5% Expected return on equities 8.1% 7.1% 8.3% 7.4% 64 65 Retirement age 64 65 64 65 The mortality assumption used for 2011 is PCA00, year of birth, medium cohort, which reflects increasing life expectancy.
For the Irish defined benefit scheme, being the other scheme included here, the market value of assets at the end of the year was 5,746,000 2010 4,780,000 and the actuarial value of liabilities was 8,705,000 2010 8,866,000.
The expected rates of return are based on market conditions at 30th June 2011 and represent the best estimate of future returns, allowing for risk premiums where appropriate.
For a sensitivity analysis of certain elements of the pension fund, see the note in the Business review.

Renishaw plc has also established an escrow account, into which it has paid 11,400,000 and into which it is obliged to pay approximately 158,000 per month until September 2012.
This account is subject to a registered floating charge to secure the UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
The Company has given a guarantee relating to recovery plans for the UK scheme and the trustees have the right to enforce the charges to recover any deficit up to 46,800,000 if an insolvency event occurs in relation to the Company before 1st November 2016 or if the Company has not made good any deficit up to 46,800,000 by midnight on 1st November 2016.
No scheme assets are invested in the Group's own equity.
The value of the guarantee discussed above is greater than the value of the pension fund's deficit.
As such, in line with IFRIC 14, the UK pension fund's liabilities have been increased by 23,700,000, to represent the maximum discounted liability as at 30th June 2011 30th June 2010 nil.
Following the UK government ministerial announcement in July 2010 relating to the calculation of pension fund liabilities, future UK pension increases in deferment have been determined by reference to the CPI inflation metric.
This has resulted in a one-off decrease in the UK pension deficit of 11,200,000.
Future pension increases in payment continue to be determined by reference to the RPI inflation metric.

FInancIal Instruments The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of Group financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash Currency 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pounds Sterling 7,455 3,466 7,272 8,009 19,161 11,637 US Dollar 22,771 19,358 268 217 1,357 6,764 Japanese Yen 7,922 6,240 438 610 3,152 1,765 Euro 17,558 12,263 1,202 525 2,688 3,721 Other 5,827 4,546 847 524 8,193 7,256 61,533 45,873 10,027 9,885 34,551 31,143 2011 2010 The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 000 000 Past due 0 -1 month 12,487 8,308 Past due 1 - 2 months 3,390 2,483 Past due more than 2 months 1,179 445 Balance at the end of the year 17,056 11,236 2011 2010 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 3,989 3,906 Changes in amounts provided 479 504 Amounts utilised 461 421 Balance at the end of the year 4,007 3,989 liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 200,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.
The contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the year end were: year ended 30th June 2011 carrying amount up to 1 year 1 - 2 years 2 - 5 years 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 13,821 13,821 - - Other payables 34,620 22,126 7,348 5,146 Provisions 770 770 - - Forward exchange contracts 7,285 4,789 770 1,726 56,496 41,506 8,118 6,872 64 NOTES CONTINUED 22.
The contracted cash flows for the financial liabilities are the same as the carrying values.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Under the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, all fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be categorised as Level 2. market risk As noted in the Business review under Risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with a concentration of manufacturing in the UK, Ireland and India.
exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The main exchange rates which may have a significant effect on the Groups results are the US Dollar and Japanese Yen.
The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted Euro cash flows and hence there is not expected to be a material impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change and a one Japanese Yen change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.

The fair value of these contracts at the year end resulted in a loss carried forward of 4,115,000 2010 profit 172,000 see note 21.
The nominal amounts of foreign currencies relating to these forward contracts are, in Sterling terms, 44,195,000 in US Dollars, 28,890,000 in Japanese Yen and 116,024,000 in Euro.
The Group classifies its forward contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Further details are noted in the Treasury policies in the Business review.
net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 26,464 25,950 0.25% Japanese Yen 16,084 14,510 0.10% Euro 28,430 28,335 1.50% The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle, so that at the year end, the currency borrowings are not in existence but forward contracts are in place to re-establish the currency borrowing shortly after the year end.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
For the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries not hedged, a 5% change in exchange rates will affect reserves by approximately 800,000. capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
