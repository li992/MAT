Any material transactional exposures that do arise are hedged by the Group treasury function using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Within the Groups AMEAA business there is a significant amount of cross-border trade on its sales contracts.
Cash flow hedges are entered into by the local companies to hedge the majority of the highly probable revenue.
ii Translational Central funding of individual businesses gives rise to monetary assets and liabilities.
The currency of funding is selected to ensure that any foreign exchange risk resides with Group.
This risk is then managed by the Groups treasury function, using forward foreign exchange contracts and any natural hedge positions that may exist.
iii Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and swap contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
These contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At 31 December 2011, the net total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts to which the Group is committed to sell is 364.0m 2010: sell 59.6m.
These arrangements are mainly designed to address the majority of foreign currency exposures over the next five years 2010: five years.
