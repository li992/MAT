Financial risk management Group Currency risk The Group currently exports 98% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2011 is 3.8m, 3.6m and 0.8m respectively 2010: 3.1m, 2.9m and 0.6m.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on equity for 2011 is 1.3m, 0.2m and 0.5m 2010: 1.3m, 0.4m and 0.4m respectively.
Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group hedges a proportion of sales, and occasionally purchases, denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 31.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any shortterm imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows: As at 30 September 2011 As at 30 September 2010 Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Current assets 48.4 0.9 80.2 2.2 Current liabilities 91.9 3.2 50.7 2.3 140.3 2.3 130.9 0.1 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
