ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COAL estimates as at 31 December 2011 THERMAL COAL The Coal Reserve and Coal Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as applicable.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American Thermal Coal comprises the dominantly export and domestic thermal coal operations, located in Colombia and South Africa.

For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnage gures apply to each product.
The Saleable tonnage cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnage using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account.
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnage.
Additional footnotes appear at the end of the section.
Thermal Export refers to lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation: quality measured by caloric value CV.
Thermal Domestic refers to lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation: quality measured by caloric value CV.
Synfuel refers to a coal specically for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals: quality measured by caloric value CV.
Metallurgical Other refers to semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection PCI or other general metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal: quality measured by caloric value CV.
