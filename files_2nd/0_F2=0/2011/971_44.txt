Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Barro Alto: The increase in Ore Reserves is as a result of the application of a higher metal price resulting in updated mining factors allowing the inclusion of lower grade blocks.
The increased high-grade production, higher mining rate and therefore higher dilution also contributed to the decrease in overall grade.
The decrease in Mineral Resources is as a result of conversion to Ore Reserves due to inll drilling leading to an updated geological model.
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.9% Ni cut-off and below an iron content of 30% Fe.
The Mineral Resources include 7.2 Mt of Ferruginous Laterite at an average grade of 1.18% Ni.
2 Loma fide Nquel: The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to re-allocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources as a result of the final pit being redesigned and constrained within the concession areas covered by the relevant permits.
Production accounts for 1.6 Mt of the decrease in Ore Reserves.
The Mineral Resources increased solely as a result of re-allocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources.
Refer to note 5 in the Financial statements.
The mining concessions are due for renewal in November 2012.
Mineral Resources include all mineralisation inside a saprolite envelope dened by Nickel and Iron grade boundaries 0.80% Ni and 35% Fe.
3 Niquelndia: The decrease in Ore Reserves is a result of increased mining and processing costs within the latest mine plan developed for Niquelndia and the re-allocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources, increasing the the Mineral Resources.
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.9% Ni cut-off and below an Iron content of 30% Fe.
Codemin is the the Ferro-Nickel smelter adjacent to the Niquelndia Mine.
4 Jacar: The overall increase in the Ferruginous Laterite and Saprolite Mineral Resources is due to the completion of a drilling campaign, the results of which have been included in the current Mineral Resource model with a new classication methodology applied.
In addition to the Resource pit shell developed for the Concept Study and use of a cut-off of 1.3% Ni, a minimum mineralised width of 1m must be present to allow material to be categorised as higher-grade Saprolite Mineral Resource.
The Plano fide Aproveitamento Economico PAE is currently under consideration by Brazils Departamento Nacional fide Produo Mineral DNPM.
The Saprolite Resources tabulated are a combination of higher-grade resources 1.3% Ni that are expected to feed a pyrometallurgical treatment facility and lower-grade resources 1.3% 0.9% Ni that could be used to neutralise the acid in the proposed hydrometallurgical treatment of the Ferruginous Laterite material while still recovering Nickel in the process.

3 Contained Metal: Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2012 Business plan.
The pay limit is based on Cost 4 which consists of Direct Cash Cost onand off mine, Other Indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 1.8g t and 3.7g t 4E PGE.
The range is a function ofvarious factors including depth of the ore body, geological complexity, infrastructure and economic parameters.
5 Merensky Reef: The global Ore Reserve 4E ounce content decreased primarily due to re-allocation of previously reported Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources as a result of changes in economic assumptions and extraction strategy at Thembelani Mine -17.7 Mt -2.9 Moz and portions of the 4-shaft area at Tumela Mine -3.2 Mt -0.6 Moz.
In addition, changes in reserve classication for portions of Tumelas 4-shaft area contribute to the Proved Ore Reserve tonnage decrease as Proved Ore Reserves have been re-classied as Probable Ore Reserves.
6 UG2 Reef: The global Ore Reserve 4E ounce content increased primarily due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at Thembelani Mine 26.0 Mt 3.5 Moz and Siphumelele Mine 9.2 Mt 0.9 Moz with additional contributions from Union, Twickenham and Khomanani Mines.
However, the UG2 Ore Reserves were negatively inuenced due to changes in extraction strategy for portions of Tumelas 4-shaft area which resulted in the re-allocation of previously reported Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources -19.6 Mt -2.8Moz.
7 Platreef: The Ore Reserves 4E ounce content inclusive of Proved primary ore stockpiles increased due to additional drilling and re-evaluation at Mogalakwena South 118.6 Mt 13.0 Moz, previously this area was not considered for conversion to Ore Reserves.
The Mine Life has been extended signicantly as a result.
For Mogalakwena North, Central and South previously known as Zwartfontein North the 4E pay limit is 1.0 g t. For Sandsloot and Zwartfontein South the pay limit is unchanged at 1.7 g t. 8 Platreef stockpiles: Mined ore being held for long-term future treatment.

4 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
The minimum mining width over which Mineral Resources are declared is 90cm.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
The delineation ofthe Resources that meet the requirements of reasonable expectation of eventual economic extraction has been dened using the modifying factors as dened in the SAMREC code.
These include but are not limited to mineability, geological complexity, processability and economic factors relevant to Anglo American Platinum.
The minimum resource grades per reef and per operation are in all instances greater than the Cost 4 pay limit.
Investigations conducted in 2011 to determine maximum mining depths related to virgin rock temperatures have been concluded.
A virgin rock temperature of 75 Celsius is currently considered to be the limit to mining given anticipated technology, metal prices and energy costs.
The affected portions of the Inferred Mineral Resources within the Mining Rights of Tumela Mine, Twickenham Mine and Ga-Phasha PGM Project are therefore re-classied as Deposit within the Anglo American Platinums portfolio -128.7 Mt -26.1 Moz.
During 2011 Wesizwe Platinum issued additional shares which diluted Anglo American Platinums attributable share in Wesizwe Platinum to 13% from the previous 26.6%.
As a result Anglo American Platinum can no longer apply equity accounting but has to reect the investment as an asset held for sale valued at market value -27.0 Mt -4.6Moz.
5 Merensky Reef: The decrease in Mineral Resources is primarily due to previously reported Mineral Resources being re-classied as Deposit in areas where the virgin rock temperature is expected tobe above 75 Celsius.
This applies mainly to Tumela Mine -26.6 Mt -6.7 Moz.
Disposal of Wesizwes Mineral Resources -12.0 Mt -2.4 Moz also contributes to the decrease.
However the Merensky Reef Mineral Resources were positively inuenced due to re-allocation of previously reported Ore Reserves back to Mineral Resources as a result of changes in economic assumptions at Thembelani Mine 13.8 Mt 3.1 Moz.
6 UG2 Reef: The decrease in Mineral Resources is primarily due to previously reported Mineral Resources being re-classied as Deposit in areas where the virgin rock temperature is expected to be above 75 Celsius.
This applies to Tumela Mine, Twickenham Mine and Ga-Phasha PGM Project -101.9 Mt -19.4 Moz.
The exclusion of Wesizwes Mineral Resources -15.0 Mt -2.2 Moz and conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at Thembelani and Siphumelele -27.1 Mt -4.5 Moz also contributes to the decrease.
The decrease is offset by an increase of Mineral Resources atthe Der Brochen Project due to a change in the mining method from ultra-low prole to low-prole mechanised board and pillar mining which increases the resource cut 81.0 Mt 2.8 Moz.
7 Platreef: A 1.0g t 4E PGE cut-off has been used to define Mineral Resources.
The Mineral Resource 4E ounce content increased primarily due to additional borehole information which has confirmed the presence of the Platreef at higher elevation in localised areas to the west and below the original pit shell.
Until a better understanding of this structure has been determined, a low classication confidence and a 100m swathe of geological loss have been applied to these elevated resources.
Conceptual pit shell evaluations have indicated that the pit could extend to the west and deeper to exploit these resources.
Consequently, the Mineral Resource reporting depth has increased by approximately 200m to 650m below surface elevation equivalent to 400m a. m. s. l.. Due to this increase in reporting depth the Mineral Resources increase substantially.
Pit design test work has confirmed that these resources are potentially open pitable.
The increase in tonnage is offset by the decrease of Mineral Resources due to additional conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at Mogalakwena South -123.6 Mt -13.9 Moz and at Sandsloot, where previously reported Mineral Resources are excluded as the limit of surface mining has been reached -34.6 Mt -3.2 Moz.
No Mineral Resources applicable to underground mining have been included.
However, stockpile material is included which comprises calc-silicate and oxidised material with a cut-off grade of greater than 3g t 5.2 Mt 0.6 Moz.
8 Alternative units All Reefs Measured and Indicated: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2011 is: Measured and Indicated 2,838.1 Mton 2010: 2,542.4 Mton Measured and Indicated 0.114 oz ton 2010: 0.120 oz ton 9 Tailings: Operating tailings dams cannot be geologically assessed and therefore are not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
At Rustenburg mines a dormant dam has been evaluated and the tailing forms part of the Mineral Resource statement.
During 2010 the tailings dams at Union Mine were reactivated and their resources were removed from the Mineral Resource statement.
However, for 2011, some of the Union tailings were fide-activated and as consequence now form part of the Mineral Resource statement.
A dormant tailings dam at Amandelbult is currently being drilled and its resources will be evaluated in 2012.
10 Main Sulphide Zone: The Main Sulphide Zone is the orebody mined at Unki Mine.
The Mineral Resources for the Main Sulphide Zone relate to the Unki East and West mines only.
During 2011 a new resource evaluation was completed covering Unki South, Helvetia and Paarl projects contained within the special mining lease held by Southridge Limited.
However, an independent external review of these Mineral Resource is outstanding and will only be completed during the first quarter of 2012 and therefore the Mineral Resources reported re-state the Unki East and West mines resources.

4 Boikgantsho: Anglo American Platinum holds an attributable interest of 49% of the Joint Venture between Anglo American Platinum and Anooraq Resources.
During 2011 a new resource evaluation was completed resulting in a significant change to the previous reporting which was unchanged since 2004.
A cut-off grade of 1g t 3E was applied, the same as for Mogalakwena Platreef 1g t 4E.
The new evaluation excludes oxidised material up to a depth of 40m.
The resources are reported only to a depth of 300m below surface and excludes losses due to the major dykes and a swathe of 200m either side of the major Drenthe fault, which has a displacement of approximately 2.2km.
5 Shebas Ridge: Anglo American Platinum holds an attributable interest of 35% of the Joint Venture between Anglo American Platinum, Aquarius Platinum and the South African Industrial Development Corporation IDC.
Re-interpretation of the geology together with structural complexity resulted in a revised model with a significant decrease of the resource classication confidence.
Additionally, the reporting depth below surface has been reduced.
Note that since 2011 the joint venture area encompasses all Prospects Rights of the Shebas Ridge project.
The geological loss increased from a previously used 0.5% to 5% within the Measured category and to 10% within the Indicated and Inferred categories.
Previously the cutoff grade used was $10.5 t recoverable value, agure supplied by Ridge Mining using metal price projections and metallurgical recoveries.
This was changed to 0.5g t 3E in the current model.
6 Pedra Branca: Anglo American Platinum holds an attributable interest of 51% of the Joint Venture between Anglo American Platinum and Solitario Resources & Royalty.
A cut-off of 0.7g t 3E PGE was applied for resource denition.
