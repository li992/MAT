As these instruments are all held in private companies with no ready market, the events to crystallise such a valuation include the sale of shares to a third party by a substantial shareholder or the approach of an exit to the transaction, either by way of a float or a sale.
Therefore, the fair valuing of such unquoted shares has been restricted to those instruments whose value may be reliably measured, for example by one of the above events.
These instruments are otherwise held at cost.

These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

The provision for these onerous lease contracts has been made taking into account residual lease commitments, other outgoings and sub-letting arrangements.
In arriving at the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted at rates representing an estimate of the interest rates relevant to the period of provision.
The discount rate used is 2.97% 2010: not applicable.
It is envisaged that the provisions will be utilised on an even basis until 2021.
The calculation of the surplus space provisions involves two principal assumptions: an estimation of the time value of money to the Group, and the mitigating effects of sub-letting income receivable.
Cash outflows and inflows are predominantly contractually agreed fixed amounts.
The effect on the provisions of an increase decrease of 1% in the discount rate used in the calculation would be approximately 0.3 million 2010: not applicable.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of surplus space provisions to the methods and assumptions used in their estimation is therefore not considered to be significant.

The Group and Company statement of financial position for 2010 has been restated to include a reclassification of financial liabilities of 27.2 million from non-current to current.
The current liability on the revolving credit facility has arisen as commitments provided by certain lenders, within the syndicate of banks providing that facility, are scheduled to mature in the next year.
When these commitments mature, the portion of the facility shown above as current financial liabilities will be funded by the remaining lenders in the syndicate.

Deferred tax continued Deferred tax has been accounted for at the substantively enacted corporation tax rate of 26% 2010: 28%.
A progressive reduction to the main rate of UK corporation tax was announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
A reduction from 28% to 26% effective 1 April 2011 had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Further reductions to the main rate have been proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further reductions in the tax rate had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not reflected in these financial statements.
As at 31 March 2011 the Group has tax losses carried forward of 10.4 million.
It is not probable that these will be utilised and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences arising from the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries of 16.5 million, because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Additionally, any tax consequences of distribution of those profits are expected to be insignificant.
Share based payments All share based payment transactions are equity settled.
The total charge to the income statement for the year was 8.5 million 2010: 0.7 million and this was credited to the reserve in equity for share based payments.
Intermediate Capital Group plc 2001 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme The Company has a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group.

Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
i Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed in d, page 116. ii Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net asset, and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the euro and the US dollar.
The Group manages its exposure to market currency risk by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The financial assets and liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to foreign exchange rates are shown in d page 116.
This is before the effect of derivative instruments.
iii Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly the bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2011.
It is assumed that borrowings under the Groups revolving credit facility remains at the level as at 31 March 2011 until contractual maturity.

iv Refinancing risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between two and 10 years, short term borrowings under bank facilities and by issuing floating rate notes.
v Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that all financial assets that are neither past due or impaired will be recovered in full.
Details on impairments are included in note 18, which sets out the factors the Group considers when determining if a financial asset is impaired.

The total carrying amount of these instruments which include AFS financial assets and FVTPL financial assets Designated as FVTPL, Derivative financial instruments warrants is 274.4 million 2010: 281.5 million.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is likely to lie is 145.0 million to 165.0 million higher than the carrying value 2010: 60 million to 100 million.
This range of estimates has been achieved by applying a valuation technique which makes use of market-based information and is generally consistent with models used by other private equity businesses.
The estimation of fair value is based on the assumed value of the underlying business at the reporting date, with reference to the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines August 2010.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants held at cost, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
AFS financial assets and warrants fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on recent significant transactions or an earning based valuation technique.
Where a reliable fair value cannot be established, these are held at cost.
Financial assets designated as FVTPL The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets designated as FVTPL is 75.6 million 2010: 22.7 million.
Of the change in fair value in the period 1.1 million 2010: 2.1 million is due to changes in credit risk of the asset.
38.0 million 2010: 9.5 million relates to an acquisition.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
c Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
