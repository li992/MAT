R A J Swaak RA An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the company accounts.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the company accounts, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the companys preparation and fair presentation of the company accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the company accounts.
