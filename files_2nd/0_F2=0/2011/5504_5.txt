This transaction was accounted for as a capital restructuring of EnQuest and the former Lundin business Lundin North Sea, LNS and an acquisition of the former Petrofac business Petrofac Energy Developments Limited, PEDL.
Consequently the Group statement of comprehensive income, prepared in accordance with IFRS and published on page 54 of the Group Financial Statements, includes the results of LNS from the start of the 2010 calendar year but only from 5 April 2010 for PEDL.
The results of EnQuest are included from its incorporation date of 29 January 2010.
This abridged 2010 pro-forma income statement presents the trading results for both LNS and PEDL from the start of the calendar year, as though PEDL was part of the Group for the full year ended 31 December 2010.
EBITDA is calculated by taking profit loss from operations before tax and finance income costs, deducting gain on disposal of asset held for sale note14 and adding back depletion note 10, depreciation note 10, impairment notes 13 & 15 and write off of tangible and intangible oil and gas assets notes 13 & 15.
EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS.
