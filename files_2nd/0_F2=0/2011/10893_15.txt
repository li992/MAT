Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred Environmental Restructuring Emissions taxation Other Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2010 70 46 6 817 47 986 Charged to profit and loss account 5 33 7 44 17 18 Transferred to reserves - - - 3 - 3 Utilised 7 12 - - 4 23 Released - - 6 - 5 11 Unwinding of discount 3---- 3 At 31 March 2011 71 67 7 776 55 976 Environmental provision The environmental provision represents the net present value of the estimated statutory decontamination costs of old gas manufacturing sites owned by the Company discounted using a real rate of 2.0%.
The anticipated timing of the cash flows for statutory decontamination cannot be predicted with certainty, but they are expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision for gas site decontamination, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2011 was 112m 2010: 110m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2011, 26m of the total restructuring provision 2010: 26m related to the restructuring of our Liquefied Natural Gas LNG storage facilities, and 14m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2010: 5m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid over the next two years.
Emissions provision The provision for emission costs is expected to be settled using emission allowances granted or purchased.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation comprises: 2011 2010 m m Accelerated capital allowances 798 832 Other timing differences 22 15 776 817 Deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of 15m 2010: 15m have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
The capital losses are available to carry forward indefinitely.
The capital losses can be offset against specific types of future capital gains.
There are no other significant unrecognised deferred tax assets or liabilities 2010: nil.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2011 include 5m 2010: 6m in respect of property transfer costs related to the sales of four UK gas distribution networks and 22m 2010: 21m in respect of employer liability claims.
The payment dates for the property transfer costs are uncertain, but should largely be over the next two years.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.

e Litigation and claims Metering competition investigation As previously reported, on 25 February 2008 the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority GEMA announced it had decided we had breached Chapter 11 of the Competition Act 1998 and Article 82 now Article 102 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and fined us 41.6m.
Following appeals, the Competition Appeal Tribunal reduced the fine to 30m and the Court of Appeal further reduced the fine to 15m.
On 22 March 2010, we applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's judgement.
On 28 July 2010, the Supreme Court denied our application and this ends the legal process.
The 15m fine was paid to GEMA on 1 April 2010.

Ofgem also stated that the penalty would have been higher had it not been for the cooperation and corrective action by National Grid.
On 10 March 2011, following the end of the period in which representations could be made, Ofgem wrote to the Company to confirm its decision.
On 13 May 2011, we received the Final Penalty Notice and the penalty has now been paid.
