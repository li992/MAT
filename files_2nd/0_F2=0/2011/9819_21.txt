Section 4: Financial Statements NOTES For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 2010: 52 weeks ended 2 October 2010 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and Standing Interpretations Committee SIC interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefits and share-based payments.
New standards and interpretations The following new accounting standards and interpretations were effective in the current period: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendments relating to oil and gas assets and determining whether an arrangement contains a lease Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Amendments relating to group cash-settled share-based payment transactions IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendments relating to classification of rights issues IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments These have not impacted, and are not likely to have a future impact on, the financial statements of the Group.
In 2010 the UK Government announced its intention to change the measure of inflation for the purposes of statutory minimum rates at which pensions must increase for public and private sector defined benefit schemes.
This change would reference the consumer prices index CPI as the measure of inflation rather than the retail prices index RPI as is currently the case.
Some of the Groups defined benefit pensions are linked to statutory inflation increases.
As such, increases in these pensions will now be based on CPI.
This has been reflected in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the Groups defined benefit plan at the end of the current period.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following new or revised standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Replacement of fixed dates for certain exceptions with the date of transition to IFRSs 1 July 2011 Additional exemption for entities ceasing to suffer from severe hyperinflation 1 July 2011 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments enhancing disclosures about transfers of financial assets 1 July 2011 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement New accounting standard 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement New accounting standard 1 January 2013 IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to revise the way other comprehensive income is presented 1 July 2012 IAS 12 Income Taxes Limited scope amendment recovery of underlying assets 1 January 2012 IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amended Standard resulting from the Post-Employment Benefits and Termination Benefits projects 1 January 2013 IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised definition of related parties 1 January 2011 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Reissued as IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements as amended in 2011 1 January 2013 48 Marstons PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
co. uk 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Financial Statements 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED IAS 28 Investments in Associates Reissued as IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as amended in 2011 1 January 2013 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction November 2009 Amendments with respect to voluntary prepaid contributions 1 January 2011 The IASB have also issued a number of minor amendments to standards as part of their Annual Improvements to IFRS.
Adopting the amendments to IAS 19 will require the Group to recognise a single net interest component in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The impact of this change on the Groups reported income in the period of adoption will depend upon the asset profile of the plan at that date.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of any of the other above amendments will have a material impact on the Groups reported income or net assets in the period of adoption.
The Group continues to evaluate standards and interpretations and their impact on the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of Marstons PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of new subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts from the date on which control transferred to the Group or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration paid and deferred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consolidated financial statements also incorporate the results of Marstons Issuer PLC, a company set up with the sole purpose of issuing debt secured on assets owned by the Group.
The Directors of Marstons PLC consider this company meets the definition of a special purpose entity under SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and hence for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements it has been treated as a subsidiary undertaking.
Details of this company are provided in note 32.
Revenue and other operating income Revenue represents the value of goods principally drink and food and services principally accommodation and gaming machines supplied to customers, and rents receivable from licensed properties.
Revenue for drink, food and accommodation is recognised at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Gaming machine income is recognised as earned.
Rental income is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Revenue is recorded net of discounts, intra-Group transactions, VAT and excise duty relating to the brewing and packaging of certain products.
Other operating income comprises mainly rents receivable from unlicensed properties, which is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Operating segments For segment reporting purposes the Group is considered to have four distinguishable operating segments, being Marstons Inns and Taverns, Marstons Pub Company, Marstons Beer Company and Marstons Group Services.
This mirrors the Groups internal reporting structure, and reflects the different risk profiles to which the business is exposed.
An element of Marstons Group Services costs is allocated to each of the trading divisions.
The operating segments set out in note 2 are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
For the purposes of IFRS 8 the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Directors.
Acquired businesses are treated as separate reporting segments, where material, until they have been fully integrated with the Groups trading divisions.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as those items that, by virtue of their nature, size or expected frequency, warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
As management of the freehold and leasehold property estate is an essential and significant area of the business, the threshold for classification of property related items as exceptional is higher than other items.
Stock Exchange Code: MARS 49 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Section 4: Financial Statements NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognised separately from goodwill if the fair value of these assets can be identified separately and measured reliably.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.
Where the useful life of the asset is considered to be indefinite no annual amortisation is provided but the asset is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Impairment reviews are carried out more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired.
The useful lives of the Groups intangible assets are: Acquired brands Indefinite Lease premiums Life of the lease Computer software 5 to 10 years Development costs 10 years Any impairment of carrying value is charged to the income statement.
Research and development expenditure All expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is expensed as incurred.
Development costs are recognised as an intangible asset when the following conditions are met: zzIt is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use: zzManagement intends to complete the asset and use or sell it: zzThere is an ability to use or sell the asset: zzIt can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits: zzAdequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset are available: and zzThe expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be reliably measured.
Other development expenditure that does not meet these criteria is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, which are consistent with the Groups operating segments.
Property, plant and equipment zzFreehold and leasehold properties are initially stated at cost and subsequently at valuation.
Plant and machinery and fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are stated at cost.
zzDepreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to provide for the cost of the assets less residual value over their useful lives.
zzFreehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to residual value over 50 years.
zzShort leasehold properties are depreciated over the life of the lease.
zzPlant and machinery and fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
zzOwn labour and interest costs directly attributable to capital projects are capitalised.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
50 Marstons PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
co. uk 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Financial Statements 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED Properties are revalued by qualified valuers on a sufficiently regular basis using open market value so that the carrying value of an asset does not differ significantly from its fair value at the balance sheet date.
Substantially all of the Groups properties have been externally valued in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Red Book.
These valuations are performed directly by reference to observable prices in an active market or recent market transactions on arms length terms.
Internal valuations are performed on the same basis.
The estate is reviewed for indication of impairment at each reporting date, using a process focusing on areas of risk and business performance throughout the portfolio to identify any exposure.
Impairment losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain has been recorded, and thereafter to the income statement.
Surpluses on revaluation are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that they reverse previously charged impairment losses, in which case the reversal is recorded in the income statement.
Disposals of property, plant and equipment Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment represents net sale proceeds less the carrying value of the assets.
Any element of the revaluation reserve relating to the property disposed of is transferred to retained earnings at the date of sale.
Impairment If there are indications of impairment or reversal of impairment, an assessment is made of the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair market value less costs to sell.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased, a reversal of the loss is made if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
The reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at revalued amount.
The reversal of an impairment loss on a revalued asset is recognised in other comprehensive income and increases the revaluation surplus for that asset.
However to the extent that an impairment loss on the same revalued asset was previously recognised in the income statement, the reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
There is no reversal of impairment losses relating to goodwill.
Acquired brands are reviewed for impairment on a portfolio basis.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases if the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The cost of assets held under finance leases is included within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is charged in accordance with the accounting policy for each class of asset concerned.
The corresponding capital obligations under these leases are shown as liabilities.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement and classified within finance costs as incurred.
Rental costs under operating leases, including lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Similarly, income receivable under operating leases is credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued on a first in, first out basis, with the exception of hops which are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress include direct materials, labour and a proportion of attributable overheads.
Assets held for sale Assets, typically properties and related fixtures and fittings, are categorised as held for sale when the value of the asset will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
This condition is met when the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is being actively marketed.
In addition, the Group must be committed to the sale and the completion should be expected to occur within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Stock Exchange Code: MARS 51 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Section 4: Financial Statements NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial assets in one of the following two categories: at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities in one of the following two categories: at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of the Groups financial instruments at initial recognition.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives are categorised as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as part of a hedge relationship.
The Group holds no other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, other receivables, trade loans and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade payables.
Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship are presented in the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The fair value of derivatives which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Accrued interest is recognised separately in current assets or liabilities as appropriate.
At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
52 Marstons PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
co. uk 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Financial Statements 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within exceptional finance income or costs.
Amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges are reclassified from equity to profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flow affects profit or loss.
Trade receivables and other receivables Trade receivables and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables and other receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade or other receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and estimated future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within other net operating charges.
When a trade or other receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade or other receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other net operating charges in the income statement.
Trade loans In common with other major brewers, the Group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the Groups beer.
These trade loans are classified as other non-current assets in the balance sheet and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Significant trade loans are secured against the property of the loan recipient.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Preference shares are classified as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Employee benefits Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried out at each period end date.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, any income or expenses on settlements or curtailments and past service costs where the benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising differences between the actual and expected return on scheme assets, changes in scheme liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
The liability asset recognised in the balance sheet for the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of scheme liabilities less the fair value of scheme assets.
Where the fair value of scheme assets exceeds the present value of scheme liabilities, the Group recognises an asset at the lower of the fair value of scheme assets less the present value of scheme liabilities, and the total of any cumulative unrecognised past service cost and the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Stock Exchange Code: MARS 53 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Section 4: Financial Statements NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 1 ACCOuNTINg POLICIES CONTINuED Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Post-retirement medical benefits are accounted for in an identical way to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
Key management personnel Key management personnel are those who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
In the case of Marstons PLC, the Directors of the Group are considered to be the only key management personnel.
Current and deferred tax The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, and which give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Differences are defined as the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Provisions Provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as provisions.
These provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation are the discount rate and the market rents and vacant periods of the properties.
Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Share-based payments The fair value of share-based remuneration at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the income statement takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions contained within IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and has only applied this accounting policy to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002.
Awards granted prior to 7 November 2002 are not charged to the income statement.
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value of the Groups share-based payments, and all cancellations of sharebased payments, whether by the Group or by employees, are accounted for in an identical manner with any costs unrecognised at the date of cancellation being immediately accelerated.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares, shares held within a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and shares held within an Executive Share Option Plan ESOP, which are used for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to equity.
No income or expense is recognised in the performance statements on treasury share transactions.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.

Monetary receivables and payables are remeasured at closing day rates at each balance sheet date.
Exchange gains or losses that arise from such remeasurement and on settlement of the transaction are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences for non-monetary assets valued at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Gains or losses on disposal of non-monetary assets are recognised in the income statement.
Key assumptions and significant judgements IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups key assumptions and significant judgements are in respect of property, plant and equipment, impairment, retirement benefits, financial instruments, property lease provisions, share-based payments and exceptional items.
Details of these assumptions and judgements are set out in the relevant accounting policy and detailed note to the financial statements as set out below: Property, plant and equipment zzValuation of properties see accounting policy.
zzAssets useful lives and residual values see accounting policy.
Impairment zzAssumptions made in the value in use calculation, in particular the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections and the growth rate used to extrapolate projected cash flows beyond one year budgets notes 10 and 11.

On 22 November 2007, a further 330.0 million of secured loan notes tranches A4 and AB1 were issued in connection with the securitisation of an additional 437 of the Groups pubs, also held in Marstons Pubs Limited.
The loan notes are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Marstons Issuer PLC, a special purpose entity note 32.
During the period ended 1 October 2011, 8 2010: 21 of the securitised pubs were sold to third parties, one 2010: nil was sold to another member of the Group and 3 2010: 20 pubs were acquired from other members of the Group.
The carrying amount of the securitised pubs at 1 October 2011 was 1,433.2 million 2010: 1,399.1 million.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Marstons Pubs Limited.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on the ability to move cash to other companies within the Group.
The securitised debt at 1 October 2011 consists of six tranches with the following principal terms: Principal repayment 2011 2010 period by Expected Expected Tranche m m Interest instalments average life maturity date A1 162.1 176.2 Floating 2011 to 2020 9 years 2020 A2 214.0 214.0 Fixed floating 2020 to 2027 8 years 2019 A3 200.0 200.0 Fixed floating 2027 to 2032 16 years 2027 A4 228.6 234.8 Floating 2011 to 2031 20 years 2031 AB1 80.0 80.0 Floating 2031 to 2035 24 years 2035 B 155.0 155.0 Fixed floating 2032 to 2035 8 years 2019 1,039.7 1,060.0 It is currently assumed that the Class A2, A3 and B notes will be refinanced at their step-up date.
It is not currently expected that the Class A1, A4 and AB1 notes will be refinanced at their step-up date.
Interest on the Class A1 notes is payable at three month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.55%, stepping up to three month LIBOR plus 1.375% from July 2012.
Interest on the Class A2 notes is payable at a rate of 5.1576% until July 2019 and thereafter at three month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.32%.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market, such as over-the-counter derivatives, is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Over the life of the Groups derivative financial instruments the cumulative fair value gain loss on those instruments will be nil as it is the Groups intention to hold them to maturity.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Interest rate risk: The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates, and as such the Groups interest rate risk arises from its long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower during the period ended 1 October 2011, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been 0.2 million 2010: 0.2 million higher lower as a result of lower higher interest expense.
Stock Exchange Code: MARS 71 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Section 4: Financial Statements NOTES CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2011 20 FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS CONTINuED The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate payable on the floating rate tranches of its securitised debt note 19.
These derivative financial instruments have qualified for cash flow hedge accounting.
Consequently, changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
The losses taken directly to other comprehensive income in the period totalled 26.6 million 2010: 30.8 million.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 1 October 2011 totalled 470.7 million 2010: 491.0 million.
The interest rate swaps, including borrowing margins, fix interest at 5.3% and 6.0%.
On 1 October 2007 the Group entered into two interest rate swaps of 70.0 million each to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
These derivative financial instruments have not qualified for cash flow hedge accounting.
Consequently, changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement.
The gains taken to the income statement in the period totalled 3.1 million 2010: losses of 4.7 million note 4.
The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap contracts at 1 October 2011 totalled 140.0 million 2010: 140.0 million.
The interest rate swaps fix interest at 5.5% and 5.6%.
On 20 May 2009 the Group entered into a further interest rate swap of 20.0 million to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
This swap contract fixed interest at 1.1% and terminated on 8 August 2010.
This derivative financial instrument qualified for cash flow hedge accounting.
Consequently, changes in fair value were recognised in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
The gains taken directly to other comprehensive income in the prior period totalled 0.1 million.
Also on 20 May 2009 the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap of 20.0 million to continue to fix the interest rate payable on the Groups unsecured bank borrowings.
This derivative financial instrument has qualified for cash flow hedge accounting.
The gains taken directly to other comprehensive income in the period totalled 0.3 million 2010: losses of 1.3 million.
The notional principal amount of this interest rate swap contract at 1 October 2011 was 20.0 million 2010: 20.0 million.
The interest rate swap fixes interest at 3.3%.
This interest rate swap commenced on 9 August 2010 and terminates on 8 August 2013.
The interest rate risk profile, after taking account of derivative financial instruments, is as follows: 2011 2010 Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m m Borrowings 1,189.4 1,189.4 0.6 1,157.1 1,157.7 The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial borrowings was 5.5% 2010: 5.5% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed was six years 2010: seven years.
Foreign currency risk: The Group buys and sells goods denominated in non-sterling currencies, principally US dollars and euros.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the value of the Groups income and expenditure.
The Groups exposure in this area is not considered to be significant.
Counterparty risk: The Groups counterparty risk in respect of its cash and cash equivalents is mitigated by the use of various banking institutions for its deposits.
There is no significant concentration of counterparty risk in respect of the Groups pension assets, as these are held with a range of institutions.
Credit risk: Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, an assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
The utilisation of and adherence to credit limits is regularly monitored.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits and fixtures and fittings.
Receivables are written off against the provision for impairment when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

co. uk 20680-04 2 12 11 Proof 6 Financial Statements 20 FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS CONTINuED The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of its customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.
Liquidity risk: The Group applies a prudent liquidity risk management policy, which involves maintaining sufficient cash, ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and having the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury maintains the availability of committed credit lines to ensure that the Group has flexibility in funding.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flow.
In addition, the Groups liquidity management policy involves maintaining debt financing plans, projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, and monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements.
The Groups borrowing covenants are subject to regular review.

26 SHARE-BASED P AyMENTS During the period there were three classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Save As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of the shares at the time of the invitation and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Under this scheme executive share options are awarded at the prevailing market rate on the date of the grant.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 35. c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 36, are met.
In 2010, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP to enable participants in the LTIP to benefit from UK tax efficiencies.
As such awards made in 2010 and future years comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit.
A further share award a linked award is also provided to enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option.
This linked award is satisfied by way of shares from the Companys Employee Benefit Trust but these additional shares are not delivered to the participant.
Under these rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.

34 CONTINgENT LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total fide-grouping liability now stands at 49.8 million 2010: 173.8 million, of which 46.6 million 2010: 163.6 million relates to CGT and 3.2 million 2010: 10.2 million relates to SDLT.
The Group has received refunds of 5.9 million from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
This followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc Rank, which concluded that there had been a breach of fiscal neutrality in the treatment of gaming machine income as liable to UK VAT.
The matter was referred to the European Court of Justice, which released its decision on 10 November 2011 confirming the key principles upon which Ranks case relied.
HMRC are currently considering their position and may ask for the matter to be referred back to the Upper Tribunal to further test whether the comparable machines that had different VAT treatments were in fact similar.
HMRC issued protective assessments to recover the repayments pending the result of further Court hearings.
If HMRC are ultimately successful, the Group would be required to repay the 5.9 million plus interest.
The likelihood of such a repayment being required is not considered probable.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 4.3 million 2010: 3.9 million to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letter of credit is secured on fixed deposit for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
35 EvENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DA TE Since the balance sheet date proceeds of 16.0 million have been received in relation to property disposals recorded in the period.
In October 2011, the Group commenced discussions with a syndicate of banks to refinance its existing bank facility.
On 29 November 2011, the Group entered into a new bank facility for 257.5 million expiring in May 2016.
