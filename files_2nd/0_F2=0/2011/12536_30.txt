Share-based payments and share incentive plans The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, the total cost recognised by the group for equity-settled share-based payment transactions was US$34.6 million.
A credit of US$34.6 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2010: US$52.7 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.

Share capital continued Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: i Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0% Risk free rate of interest: 2.9% to 3.7% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.32 ii Share Incentive Plan Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
iii Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

Group pension schemes continued Funded pensions The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2011.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2011, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 26 September 2008.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 25 per cent of the aggregate of members pensionable salaries.

The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2011 is 5.0 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2012 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the components of pension expense are: 2012 $ million Current service cost 0.2 Interest cost 1.4 Expected return on Scheme assets 1.4 Total 0.2 Unfunded pensions In Indonesia, the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement with the local workforce.
This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2011 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2010: US$0.9 million.
Defined contribution benefit scheme The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions.
Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The total cost charged to income of US$3.5 million 2010: US$2.6 million represents contributions payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.

Events after the balance sheet date Acquisition Subsequent to year-end, the company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore Oil plc EnCore.
EnCore was an AIM listed oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the offshore UK Continental Shelf where its portfolio of assets included interests in the Catcher and Cladhan discoveries, exploration acreage and a 30 per cent holding in Egdon Resources plc, an AIM listed exploration and production company focused on onshore assets with interests in the UK and Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement announced on 5 October 2011, shareholders in EnCore were offered a consideration of 70 pence in cash for each EnCore share held.
Alternatively, EnCore shareholders could elect to receive 0.2067 new shares in the company for each EnCore share held instead of part or all of the cash consideration.
On completion, shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCores shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in the company paying a total of 14.1 million US$21.6 million in cash to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new Ordinary Shares to those who chose the share alternative.
The new shares began trading on 17 January 2012.
As a result of the acquisition, the group increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 to 50 per cent and became operator of the development.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement with TAQA Bratani Ltd TAQA to on-sell the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area which it indirectly acquired from the EnCore acquisition for a consideration of US$54.0 million.
TAQA also agreed to farm in to a 50 per cent interest in EnCores wholly-owned Block 28 10a on a promoted basis whereby it will pay 80 per cent of certain well costs and 50 per cent of back costs on the Coaster prospect, planned to be drilled as part of the companys 2012 drilling programme.
The on-sale of these assets was completed in March 2012.
The transaction will be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 16 January 2012, being the date on which the group gained control of EnCore.
Information in respect of assets acquired is still being assessed and the fair value allocation to the EnCore assets is provisional in nature and will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
By the year-end date, acquisition-related expenses of US$4.2 million had been incurred by the group and were included within general and administration costs.
Re-financing The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, jointly guarantees the groups borrowing facilities.
Subsequent to year-end, the group successfully negotiated a new US$350.0 million revolving credit facility to replace the US$175.0 million term loan.
This new facility matures in 2017.
In addition, the group completed a private placement of senior notes of US$202.0 million and 25.0 million with maturities between 2019 and 2024.
