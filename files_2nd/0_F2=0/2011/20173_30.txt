Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors of the Company review the financial performance of the Group on the investment basis.
However, the Directors also review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography and is consistent with the consolidated accounting basis.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
However, the Company received 70% 2010: 55% of its portfolio income in the year from investments held in the UK and a further 30% 2010: 45% of portfolio income from investments held in Europe.
The Group received income from its investment in AWG of 39.5 million, which represents 30% of the investment return.
There was no other income entitlement during the year that represented more than 10% of investment return.

For this reason, the Directors have classified the portfolio as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
The fair value of loans and receivables approximates to the carrying value.
All debt investments are held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group invested in Elgin Infrastructure Limited in December 2009.
It has been treated as a joint venture and under IAS 31 it has been held at fair value through profit and loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Elgin Infrastructure Limited was incorporated as a Special Purpose Entity in October 2009, to hold the underlying portfolio of PFI projects.
As at 31 March 2011 there were no outstanding commitments from the Group, or from the Company to Elgin Infrastructure Limited, or to the underlying assets of Elgin Infrastructure Limited 2010: nil.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are Debt investments held at fair value observable in the market either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loans and receivables Unquoted equity instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments can be found in the section called Portfolio valuation methodology.
The debt investments held at fair value through profit and loss had a carrying value of 90.2 million 2010: 123.7 million.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy the debt instruments held at fair value are classified as Level 2 with reference to observable market information.

This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Returns and Risk section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards investment committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework.
The funding objective of the Group and Company is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs ought to be met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowings and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 13 and the Groups and Companys equity are analysed into their various components in the Statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital, therefore the Directors consider that the Company has met all of its external capital requirements throughout the year.
Capital is allocated for investment in Utilities, Transportation and Social Infrastructure across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans and receivables, debt investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Through the year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties principally in AAA rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with AA credit rating.
The credit quality of loans and receivables and debt instruments within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed, or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2011, the Groups shareholder loan investment of 3.7 million in T2C was considered to be impaired 2010: 3.7 million impaired.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables considered past due or impaired 2010: nil.

Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2011, the Group did not consider itself to have exposure to one large counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.

Cash flows upon settlement of interest rate swap contracts are intended to be settled net of the finance costs arising from loans and borrowings and therefore the net cash flows are shown in the table above.
The financial commitment relates to the Companys commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund.
The cash flows from financial assets are not used to manage contractual liquidity risk.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups and the Companys sensitivities to these are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2010: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease on net assets and to the net profit of 4.6 million for the Group 2010: 11.7 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest payable and receivable on floating rate debt instruments and cash on deposit and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and fixed rate debt instruments held at year end.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
The Group and the Company do not hold any fixed rate debt investments or borrowings and are therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
The Company does not hold variable rate loans as assets or liabilities and is therefore only exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its cash holdings.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2010: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease on net assets and to net profit of 4.2 million for the Company 2010: 7.7 million.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Returns and Risk section.
The currency denominations of the Groups and the Companys net assets and net profit are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Group and Companys net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

A 10% change in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.
As at 31 March 2011 As at 31 March 2010 Unquoted Debt Unquoted Debt investments investments Total investments investments Total m m m m m m Impact on net profit 72.4 9.0 81.4 66.9 12.4 79.3 Impact on net assets 72.4 9.0 81.4 66.9 12.4 79.3 The Company has direct exposure to market price risk through its direct unquoted equity holding in Elgin Infrastructure Limited.
A 10% increase in movement in the fair value of the investment would result in a 2.5 million impact on the Companys net profit and net assets 2010: 2.0 million.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
However, the Directors have a set investment policy that sets predefined limits for the exposure of the Group to an individual asset.
These limits have not been exceeded at 31 March 2011 or at 31 March 2010, and hence the Directors do not consider that any of these investments represents a large exposure.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups and the Companys exposure to their financial risks throughout the period to which they relate.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the Statement of comprehensive income.
As at 31 March 2011, the notional amount of forward foreign exchange contracts was 177.2 million 2010: 138.4 million.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses variable to fixed interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its floating-rate interest bearing borrowings.
