The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and expanded by the Additional Guidance on EEV disclosures published in October 2005.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profit on this business is generated over a significant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in Prudentials opinion, fully reflect the value of future profit streams.
Prudential considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Groups in-force long-term businesses and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
There has been no change to the basis of presentation of the EEV results from the 2010 results and financial statements.
Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns Consistent with previous reporting practice, the Group provides supplementary analysis of IFRS profit before tax attributable to shareholders and analyses its EEV basis results, so as to distinguish operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from other elements of total profit.
On both the IFRS and EEV bases, operating earnings per share are calculated using operating profits based on longer-term investment returns, after related tax and non-controlling interests.
These profits exclude short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
The operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for 2010 also excludes the costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction and the gain arising upon the dilution of the Groups holding in PruHealth.
Under the EEV basis, where additional profit and loss effects arise, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions.
After adjusting for related tax and non-controlling interests, the amounts excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns are included in the calculation of earnings per share.
