The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income attributable to such reserves.
Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% 2010 10%.
The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$96.10bbl.
and the long-term average gas price at US$4.07 mcf per 1,000 cubic feet.
A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$5.10 mcf in 2010, together with a review of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of 1.0m in the year.
Under IFRS, at acquisition, inventory values are adjusted from their carrying values generally at cost of production to a fair value, which includes profit attributable to the degree of completion of the inventory.
This resulted in a fair value uplift totalling 23.6m for the four acquisitions.
This uplift is charged to the income statement as the inventory is sold, thereby reducing reported operating profits.
A 1.6m charge for bonuses for key employee retention, relating to the acquisitions, has been recognised.
Following a downturn of business activity levels in 2011, a goodwill impairment charge of 1.5m 2010 nil has been recognised in relation to PT SMB Industri.
Following a reassessment of its property provisions, the Group has recognised an additional provision of 2.2m for onerous lease obligations as a result of additional remediation and dilapidation costs and the impact of the economic downturn on the recoverability of rental income.
Unamortised loan facility fees of 1.0m 2010 nil were written off to the income statement when the 120.0m revolving credit facility was terminated early and replaced with the 375.0m revolving credit facility, following the acquisition of Titan.

The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: Restated 2011 2010 m m Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders From continuing operations 28.4 20.6 From discontinued operations 50.7 1.2 Total 79.1 21.8 Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders before amortisation and exceptional items From continuing operations 28.4 20.6 Add: amortisation and exceptional items after taxation note 5 25.8 9.9 Total for continuing operations 54.2 30.5 From discontinued operations 50.7 1.2 Add: exceptional items after tax 50.0 4.6 Total for discontinued operations 0.7 5.8 millions millions Basic weighted average number of Ordinary shares 137.1 131.3 Dilutive outstanding share options 1.4 1.8 Long-term incentive plans 1.6 0.9 Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 140.1 134.0 pence pence Basic EPS From continuing operations 20.7 15.6 From discontinued operations 37.0 1.0 57.7 16.6 Diluted EPS From continuing operations 20.3 15.4 From discontinued operations 36.2 0.9 56.5 16.3 Earnings per share before amortisation and exceptional items: pence pence Basic EPS from continuing operations before amortisation and exceptional items 39.6 23.1 Diluted EPS from continuing operations before amortisation and exceptional items 38.7 22.7 Basic EPS from discontinued operations before amortisation and exceptional items 0.5 4.5 Diluted EPS from discontinued operations before amortisation and exceptional items 0.5 4.4 Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 79 FinancialXstatements v44.

These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past experience and order books.
Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates between 3% and 5%, which decline over time.
The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates and will incorporate, where relevant, projected rig counts and the expected profile of drilling.
Cash flows are discounted using pre-tax rates between 8.6% and 14.5% 2010 8.9% and 12.3%, as shown in the above table.
Thediscount rate best reflects the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
Impairment of goodwill Following a downturn of business activity levels in 2011, a goodwill impairment charge of 1.5m 2010 nil has been recognised in relation to PT SMB Industri.
Sensitivities Having performed a sensitivity analysis, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Derivatives and Financial Instruments continued Hedge of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Group has US dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its US subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2011, the carrying amount of US dollar borrowings was 244.1m.
At 31 December 2011, foreign exchange losses of 4.7m 2010 nil on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the cumulative translation reserve.
Financial Risk Factors The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash flow interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, the investment of surplus cash, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign exchange risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of US dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: US dollar Canadian dollar 2011 2010 2011 2010 Average exchange rate to sterling 1.60 1.55 1.59 1.59 Year-end exchange rate to sterling 1.55 1.57 1.58 1.56 i Transactional risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than 250,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed 500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge, borrowings designated in a hedge of the net investment in its US subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

ii Translational risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the hedged assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from US dollar denominated net investments.
b Interest rate risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
During the year, the Group needed to ensure that sufficient liquid funds were available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
Surplus cash was, therefore, invested by the treasury function in AAA rated, instant access Money Market Funds and in fixed-rate bank deposits, with terms of between overnight and three months.
As the funds were invested for short periods of time, the interest yield on these was relatively low.
However, the preservation of the Groups net cash took priority over earning high interest yields.
c Credit risk The Groups credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Surplus cash is only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board.
The process of investing excess cash is conducted and monitored by the Groups treasury function.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents, which total 68.8m 2010 268.7m at the year end, and investments of 2.4m 2010 2.5m have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
All cash and cash equivalents and investments are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.

Financial Risk Factors continued The Company operates a pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with pension plan assets of 4.8m 2010 5.5m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been affected by using three insurers, so as to spread itscredit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
d Liquidity risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly treasury reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
A new bank facility agreement was signed on 5 August 2011.
The five-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility of 375.0m replaced Huntings existing 120.0m facility on completion of the acquisition of Titan on 16 September 2011.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total 423.6m 2010 153.9m at the year end.
The facilities comprise 375.0m 2010 120.0m of committed facilities and 48.6m 2010 33.9m of uncommitted facilities.
Of the uncommitted facilities, 0.4m is secured on the machinery that the loan was used to purchase and 48.2m is unsecured.
The 375.0m committed facility is unsecured.
The committed facilities comprise the 375.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Groups treasury function maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year-end: 2011 2010 m m Floating rate: Expiring between two and five years 128.5 120.0 128.5 120.0 Surplus funds are placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2011.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2011.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions but including onerous leases and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.

The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
It is expected that 2.5m of the provision will be utilised in 2012, 2.9m in 2013 and the remaining balance of 12.4m utilised from 2014 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.33% and 2.12% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of 6%.
The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of one to fifteen years.
Following the disposal of Gibson Energy in 2008, the Group recognised a provision for tax indemnities.
These provisions are expected to be utilised in 2012.
Post-Employment Benefits Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to finalsalary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependant on future investment returns.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks havelargely been eliminated.
This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year.
However, the obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the existing insurance policies to secure further benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was produced and updated to 31 December 2011 by independent qualifiedactuaries.
The present value ofthedefined benefit has been calculated on the basis that benefits continue to be linked to the RPI measure ofinflation.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were: 2011 2010 Annual rates Rate of increase in salaries 5.2% 5.6% Rate of increase in pensions 3.2% 3.6% Discount rate 4.7% 5.4% Inflation RPI 3.2% 3.6% The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.3 years 2010 24.1 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.4 years 2010 27.3 years for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old female currently has an expected future lifetime of 25.8 years 2010 25.7 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.7 years 2010 27.6 years for a female reaching 65 in 20 years time.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with RPI inflation.
Long-term rates of return expected at 31 December: 2011 2010 Annual rates Insurance annuity policies 4.7% 5.4% Bonds n a 4.2% Cash 0.6% n a The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long-term return on the major asset classes insurance annuity policies, bonds and cash weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.

The balance of debt and equity, as reflected in the gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is managed having due regard to the respective cost of funds and their availability.
The Groups net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.
The level of net debt and related gearing ratio of 30% at 31 December 2011 is considered comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining, giving management ongoing flexibility.
For debt funding, the Group ensures that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with, and that appropriate forecast headroom exists, to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place.
Our bank facility covenants require EBITDA to cover relevant finance charges by a minimum of 4 times and net debt to adjusted EBITDA has a maximum of 3.5 times.
The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year.
Both key bank covenant metrics atyear end were well covered.
Return on average capital employed is a KPI management uses to assess business unit performance.
The Group return on capitalemployed has fallen from 16% during 2010 to 15% in 2011 primarily due to the higher level of capital employed following the acquisition programme.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, issues of share capital.
The Board considers each ordinary dividend proposed based on the merits of the information available to it at the time.
Consideration is given to the financial projections of business performance and capital investment needs, together with feedback from shareholder discussions.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function with policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These cover funding, banking relationships, foreign currency, interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
Further detail on financial risks is provided within note 31.
The Group has significant foreign operations and hence results originate in a number of currencies, particularly in US dollars.
As a result, the Groups financial statements, which are reported in sterling, are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to currency conversions.
Currency options are used to reduce currency risk movements on the Groups results, by hedging approximately 50% of each years budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
Currency exposure on the balance sheet is, where practical, reduced by financing assets with borrowings in the same currency.
Spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.

Share-based Payments Executive Share Options The Company operates an executive share option scheme, which granted options to eligible employees.
Vesting of options granted was subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committee Report, over a three year period.
Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.
Under this scheme, the final vesting of options occurred on 4 March 2011.
Options were valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular features ofthe options.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows: Date of grant 04.03.2008 06.03.2007 Exercise price p 784.5 640.0 Share price at grant p 784.5 640.0 Expected volatility % pa 32 36 Dividend yield % pa 1.1 1.17 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.3 4.9 Turnover rates % pa 5 5 Fair value at grant p 294.9 248.4 Assumed likelihood of satisfying performance condition at: 31 December 2010 75% 100% 31 December 2011 100% 100% The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options were 20% in the money.
The expected volatility is calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to each grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is 0.2m 2010 0.6m and is recognised as part of operating expenses.

Share-based Payments continued Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the average closing mid-market price of the Companys share price for the three trading days prior to the date of grant.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 755.0p 2010 676.6p.
Under the PSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to executive Directors and senior employees.
Awards and options are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period.
The PSP is a share award scheme and as such there is no exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period from date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.

Share-based Payments continued The assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2011 2010 Assumptions: Weighted average share price at grant 774.5p 587.5p Expected volatility Hunting PLC 50.7% 44.4% Expected volatility Comparator group 71.4% 58.3% Risk free rate 1.9% 1.8% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 525.89p 401.64p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected volatilities of each constituent of the comparator group are calculated on thesame basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the PSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge for 2011 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is 0.8m 2010 0.4m, which is recognised in operating expenses.
Restricted Share Plan RSP The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its restricted share plan.
Under the RSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.
