The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts.
These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Intangible assets acquired via business combinations, such as the value of customer relationships, are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised over their useful life in line with the expected emergence of profit from the business.
Where software costs are separately identiable and measurable they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life.
Purchased interest in long term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The impairment loss of 15m 2010: nil for the year represents the diminution of the value in use of the Snow Rock Sports Limited brand arising from the deterioration in the retail sales environment.
The impairment charge is presented on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement within Other expenses and is largely offset by transfers to the unallocated divisible surplus as the Groups control of the vehicle arises from holdings within the with-profits part of the UK LTF.
The value in use has been estimated using a discounted cash ow model using a discount rate of 12%.
19 DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS The Group incurs costs to obtain and process new business.
These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows: Long term insurance business Acquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits part of the UK Long Term Funds LTFs which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins.
For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
General insurance A proportion of commission and other acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums is carried forward as deferred acquisition costs or, in respect of reinsurance outwards, as deferred income.
OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 123 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Investment contracts For participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable from future revenue.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
Future developments In October 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-26 regarding accounting for Deferred Acquisition Costs DAC under US GAAP, effective for financial periods beginning after 15 December 2011.
This species that only costs directly relating to successful acquisition of new or renewal contracts can be capitalised as DAC.
All other acquisition-related costs must be expensed as incurred.
Legal & General applies US GAAP to report the insurance contract business of its US subsidiaries.
As permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, the Group will adopt the new guidance as an improvement in accounting policy from 1 January 2012, applying it retrospectively.
It is estimated that retrospective adoption will reduce DAC reported within the US business by approximately $340m 220m and reduce equity by approximately $220m 140m.
There is no impact to DAC held outside of the US business.
