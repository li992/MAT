During the year the Group reviewed the allocation of costs associated with its component and production packaging offering.
As a result, costs of 3.3m for the year ended 31 March 2010, which were previously charged in the UK where the work was undertaken, have been reallocated to the reporting segments where the products were sold.
This reallocation has no affect on any of the Group profit measures.

66 Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 6 Share-based payments The Group has a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise a Deferred Share Bonus Plan awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarding shares to senior managers and a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme which is made available to all eligible employees.
Until 2005 there was also a Long Term Incentive Option Plan LTIOP awarding options to managers.
The LTIOP was in operation before 7 November 2002 in addition to a pre-existing Long Term Incentive Plan.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have only been applied to grants made, under the LTIOP scheme, after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The total charge included in the Income Statement in the year was 4.0m 2010: 2.4m.
Of the total charge 1.9m 2010: 1.9m related to equity-settled share schemes and 2.1m 2010: 0.5m related to cash-settled share schemes.
Deferred Share Bonus plan Under the companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan, awards of shares are made to plan participants to the value of 50% of their cash bonus.
The award vests after two years, subject normally to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no other performance conditions.
A cash payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the shares will be made to the participants on vesting.
During the year a total of 308,774 shares 2010: nil and 34,938 share equivalent awards to be paid in cash 2010: nil were awarded to the scheme participants.
Deferred shares relating to bonus awards to senior managers for the year ended 31 March 2011 will be granted in June 2011.
Details of shares awarded and cash entitlements as at 31 March 2011 are set out below: Number of shares 2011 2010 Shares 308,774 Share equivalent awards to be paid in cash 34,938 343,712 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, conditional awards of shares are made to the plan participants.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
In June 2007 a conditional award of shares was made such that the vesting conditions were based on Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250.
In June 2008 the terms and conditions of the LTIP were modified such that the vesting conditions are based on both TSR performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth in Earnings per Share over the life of the scheme.
The fair value of the LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.

They provide an option price equal to the daily average market price at the date of the offer.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for the three or five year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings in an account.
Failure of either of these conditions is deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.

The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2011 amounted to 1.7m 2010: 3.9m.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 3.2m 2010: 3.1m.
During the year the statutory triennial funding valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme as at 31 March 2010 has been completed and disclosed a deficit of 1.6m.
A recovery plan has been agreed with the Pension Scheme Trustees and consequently the Group made 0.75m deficit recovery contributions to the pension scheme during the financial year ended 31 March 2011 and will make contributions of around 0.3m p. a. for the next four years.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit, on a statutory funding basis, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed, on 13 April 2011, that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
Having taken legal advice, it was determined that the majority of pensions under the scheme will continue to increase in line with the Retail Price Index RPI measure of inflation subject to the relevant caps.
Therefore there was no significant impact on the value of the scheme liabilities as a result of the United Kingdom Government changing the inflation measure to Consumer Prices Index CPI for statutory minimum increases on pensions.
The costs of the defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and Republic of Ireland were 0.4m 2010: 0.6m.
The costs of the defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and Republic of Ireland were 1.6m 2010: 1.1m, and those via government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia were 3.1m 2010: 3.2m.
The Group expects to pay 5.0m to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2012.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the liabilities of the Groups schemes were: 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Republic Republic United Kingdom Germany of Ireland United Kingdom Germany of Ireland Discount rate 5.50% 5.00% 5.00% 5.40% 4.60% 4.60% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.55% 3.00% 3.00% 2.55% 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.20% 2.00% 2.00% 3.30% 2.00% 2.00% Inflation assumption 3.30% 2.00% 2.00% 3.40% 2.00% 2.00% The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008.
The expected long term rates of return on the schemes assets as at 31 March were: 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Republic Republic United Kingdom Germany of Ireland United Kingdom Germany of Ireland Equities 7.40% n a 7.50% 7.50% n a 7.50% Corporate bonds 5.00% n a n a 4.75% n a n a Government bonds 3.90% n a 4.00% 4.00% n a 4.00% Diversified growth funds 6.90% n a n a 7.00% n a n a Enhanced matching funds 3.80% n a n a 3.70% n a n a Hedge funds n a n a n a 7.50% n a n a Credit funds 6.50% n a n a 6.50% n a n a Cash 0.00% n a n a 0.00% n a n a Other n a n a 3.50% n a n a 3.37% The expected return for each asset class is based on a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets as indicated by available yields and the views of investment organisations.

Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase to the assumed discount rate: Liabilities reduce by 6.0m Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase to the assumed inflation rate: Liabilities increase by 4.4m Effect on obligation of an assumed increase in one years life expectancy: Liabilities increase by 6.5m 8 Income tax expense 2011 2010 Taxation on the profit of the Group m m United Kingdom corporation tax at 28% 2010: 28% 9.9 12.1 United Kingdom deferred taxation 1.1 1.3 Double tax relief 5.4 8.8 5.4 Overseas taxation current 13.7 12.2 Overseas taxation deferred 13.3 5.8 Total income tax expense in Income Statement 35.8 23.4 Total tax expense is reconciled to a notional 28% 2010: 28% of profit before taxation as follows: Expected tax charge 31.9 21.3 Differences in overseas corporation tax rates 3.9 2.3 Utilisation of tax losses 3.0 0.4 Items not deductible for tax purposes 0.5 0.5 Other local taxes suffered overseas 0.8 0.5 Under over provision in prior years 1.7 0.8 35.8 23.4 Tax expense income recognised directly in other comprehensive income Recognised in retained earnings Relating to actuarial gains losses 1.9 1.7 Recognised in the hedging reserve Relating to gain on cash flow hedges 0.4 1.8 Recognised in the cumulative translation reserve Relating to gain loss on net investment hedges 0.1 0.3 2.4 0.2 Tax income recognised directly in equity Relating to equity-settled transactions 0.7 0.2 72 Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 8 Income tax expense continued The UK Budget on 23 March 2011 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 23% over a period of four years from 2011.
The first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted on 23 March 2011.
This will apply to the Groups future tax charge.
In line with this change the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 28% to 26% creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected by a benefit to the consolidated income statement 0.4m and partly in a benefit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 0.1m.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2011 have been calculated at a rate of 26%.
The reduction in rate from 26% to 23% has not yet been substantively enacted.
If these reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 0.4m.
Of this reduction it is estimated that 0.6m would have been credited to the consolidated income statement and 0.2m charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Deferred taxation balances are analysed in note 21.

Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for five years.
These cash flows are based on extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts.
These are subject to assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond five years, are extrapolated using a long term annual growth rate of 2% 2010: 2% which is consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rate for the distribution industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9% 2010: 9% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rates for the distribution industry and do not exceed expected long-term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC at 31 March 2011 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied Electronics Inc. cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.

A Derivative financial assets and liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices.
Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
B Interest-bearing loans held at fair value These comprise foreign currency denominated interest bearing loans which are subject to hedge accounting.
The foreign currency amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
C Cash and cash equivalents, Bank overdrafts, Interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise local bank account balances, which typically bear interest at rates set by reference to local applicable rates or cash float balances which have not yet cleared for interest purposes.
Fair values are estimated to equate to carrying amounts as their re-pricing maturity is less than one year.
Interest bearing loans held at amortised cost comprise fixed rate foreign currency denominated loans.
For carrying values the foreign currency principal amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
D Finance lease liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.

For amounts with a re-pricing maturity of less than one Foreign currency transactional risk year, fair value is assumed to approximate to the carrying amount.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk because most operating companies have some level of payables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.

In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Liquidity risk Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.

Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 83 Notes to the Group accounts continued 20 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore for this reason the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair market value: Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments: Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings and that these limits are not exceeded.
Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trading receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2011 2010 m m United Kingdom 63.3 55.5 Continental Europe 84.3 69.4 North America 29.7 24.9 Asia Pacific 23.9 19.9 201.2 169.7 86 Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 20 Financial instruments continued The ageing of net trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2011 2010 m m Not past due 151.5 126.6 Past due 0-60 days 45.5 40.0 Past due 60-120 days 3.1 2.5 Past due 120 days 1.1 0.6 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of loans and receivables during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Balance at 1 April 2010 5.2 5.5 Impairment loss gain recognised 0.3 0.3 Balance at 31 March 2011 5.5 5.2 Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as headline operating profit as a percentage of net assets plus net debt.
The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to shareholders.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
21 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 0.3 9.3 10.6 9.3 10.3 Goodwill 43.5 39.6 43.5 39.6 Retirement benefit obligations 0.5 3.5 0.5 3.5 Inventories 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Employee benefits 2.9 1.8 2.9 1.8 Provisions 1.6 1.4 1.6 1.4 Other items 1.0 1.0 0.2 1.0 0.8 Tax losses 10.7 18.3 10.7 18.3 Tax assets liabilities 16.8 26.4 52.9 50.4 36.1 24.0 Set off of tax 7.5 16.5 7.5 16.5 Net tax assets liabilities 9.3 9.9 45.4 33.9 36.1 24.0 The increase in the deferred tax liability is largely due to the continuing tax amortisation of overseas goodwill.
This deferred tax liability is not expected to crystallise in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses where current projections show that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the near future against which these losses may be offset.
2011 2010 m m Unrecognised deferred tax assets Tax losses 11.3 16.2 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of tax losses which can be carried forward against future taxable income as recoverability is uncertain.
At the balance sheet date, the estimated aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2010: 5.9m.
In the prior year, no liability was recognised in respect of these differences because the Group was in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the Group has sufficient relevant losses to offset fully the 5.9m liability.
During the year the Group undertook a transaction which crystallised the liability, which will be offset fully by losses on which no deferred tax asset has previously been recognised.
Deferred tax is provided at the standard rate of corporation tax applicable at the balance sheet date unless there is legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date changing the rate.
