SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 51 12 Directors Remuneration Report AUDITED INFORMATION Base salary and benefits Executive Directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account the responsibilities, skills and experience of each individual, pay and employment conditions within the Company and the Group, and salary levels within listed companies of a similar size.
Current base salary levels are as follows: Name of Director 2012 2011 Julian Dunkerton, Chief Executive Officer 400,000 400,000 James Holder, Brand and Design Director 300,000 300,000 Theo Karpathios, Chief Executive Officer Wholesale and International 300,000 300,000 Chas Howes, Group Finance Director 225,000 225,000 It was agreed there would be no increase to salaries for the Executive Directors at the annual pay review date of 1 May 2011.
As from 1 May 2011, the benefit packages for all Executive Directors have been enhanced with the introduction of the benefit of life insurance cover.
Long term incentives Following shareholder approval at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the SuperGroup Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced to enable the Group to incentivise and reward participants appropriately for contributing to the delivery of the Groups strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level of long-term performance pay.
Under the PSP, each year individuals may receive awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded, subject to the satisfaction of sliding scale performance conditions measured over a three year period and continued service.
Leaver and change of control provisions are consistent with best practice.
Awards are normally made following the announcement of the annual results.
Although Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the PSP, the Committee believes at the current time that their significant shareholdings in the Company are sufficient to incentivise them and align interests with longer term Group performance.
No awards have as yet been granted to Executive Directors under the SuperGroup PSP.
Therefore awards under the PSP are currently restricted to Senior Executives.
However, Executive Directors future participation will be reviewed by the Remuneration Committee on an ongoing basis.
The PSP individual annual limit is a maximum of 200% of an individuals base salary, although there is scope to grant up to 300% of base salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. on recruitment.
Actual award levels to Senior Executives are generally significantly below this maximum level.
For the awards granted in September 2010 and March 2011, performance relates to the three year period ending on the 2012 2013 financial year end.
Performance measures for the initial awards are 70% based on sliding scale earnings per share EPS and 30% based on total shareholder return TSR relative to a selected group of retailers.
The Remuneration Committee has confirmed that the same performance measures will be used for awards granted in July 2011.
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied that there has been an improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
Similar performance targets will be operated for awards granted to Senior Executives in 2011 2012.
Greater details will be provided in future Remuneration Reports with respect to performance targets to the extent that Executive Directors participate in future years.
The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that the blend of EPS and TSR targets will provide a balance between incentivising and rewarding strong financial performance while creating a strong alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by rewarding stock market outperformance.
