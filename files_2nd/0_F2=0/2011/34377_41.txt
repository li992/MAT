DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS Sustainable buildings are more efficient and NEXT YEARS CHALLENGE: Transforming building design and engineering across flexible to operate, and age better they also our supply chain, against a rapidly changing regulatory have lower carbon emissions.
We push the agenda by sharing best practice and actively engaging NEXT YEAR, WE WILL: with the Government, the construction industry and occupiers.
Explore opportunities to achieve our zero-carbon target In February 2011, we updated our Sustainability Brief for on development projects: Developments, following consultation with industry experts, Work with our contractors and architects to improve a review of changing regulation and feedback from our project procurement standards for sustainable materials: teams.
Our new brief provides clarity to our supply chain on what we expect from them, at the same time as encouraging innovation Reduce our embodied carbon footprint through changes and stretching project-specific targets.

We continued to apply our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System across our expanding development For our 2011 12 targets visit www.
