80 easyJet plc Notes to the accounts Annual report and accounts 2011 Continued 6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee share trusts.
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.

The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use calculations of the route network.
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the strategic plan for the period up to 2015 approved by the Board, using the following key assumptions: Pre-tax discount rate derived from weighted average cost of capital 910% Fuel price US dollars per metric tonne 1,060 Exchange rates US dollar 1.60 Euro 1.15 Swiss franc 1.30 Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent managements view of reasonable average rates and are derived from recent market information.
Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates.
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates.
No impairment resulted from any of these scenarios.
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.
