The differences are explained below: 2011 2010 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Profit loss on ordinary activities before taxation 27,556 407,458 379,902 12,798 533,418 546,216 Profit loss on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax 26.5% 2010: 28% 7,302 107,976 100,674 3,583 149,357 152,940 Effects of: Non taxable UK dividends 2,241 2,241 1,614 1,614 Non taxable overseas dividends 5,798 5,798 4,204 4,204 Withholding tax suffered 1,457 1,457 1,059 1,059 Overseas tax taken as an allowable deduction 152 152 Losses gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss not subject to tax 107,976 107,976 149,357 149,357 Prior year tax adjustment 72 72 Increase in excess management expenses and finance charges 889 889 2,235 2,235 1,457 1,457 1,131 1,131 Deferred tax 2,731 2,731 4,063 4,063 Current taxation charge for the year note 7 a 1,457 2,731 1,274 1,131 4,063 5,194 At 31 December 2011 the Company had net excess management expenses of 12.1 million 2010: 8.8 million.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these as the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in the future in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing excess expenses.
There was an unrecognised deferred tax asset therefore of 3.1 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 2.4 million.
The write back of the deferred tax liability of 2.7 million is further explained in note 15.
Investment trusts are exempt from corporation tax on capital gains provided the Company obtains agreement from HM Revenue & Customs that section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 tests have been met.
