Unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the enlarged International Power 1 Introduction The pro forma financial information of the International Power Group following the Combination the enlarged International Power which follows is unaudited and does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.
The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and because of its nature, addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent enlarged International Powers actual results or financial position: does not purport to represent what the combined results actually would have been if the Combination had occurred on 1 January 2010: what those results will be for any future periods: or what the statement of net assets would have been if the Combination occurred on 31 December 2010.
The pro forma financial information for the enlarged International Power has been derived principally from the consolidated financial statements of International Power for the year ended 31 December 2011: the restated 2010 consolidated financial information relating to International Power for the year ended 31 December 2010: and the audited combined financial statements of GDF SUEZ Energy International for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Pro forma combined income statements are presented including exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements and excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements as defined in note 5 of the preceding consolidated financial statements.
All pro forma financial adjustments are directly attributable to the Combination.
No pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect synergies or cost savings that may be expected to occur after the Combination.
Other than the number of ordinary shares, monetary amounts, unless otherwise stated, are presented in euro.
2 Assumptions related to the pro forma Combined Financial Information The unaudited pro forma combined income statements for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 assume that the Combination occurred on 1 January 2010.
The IFRS 3 acquisition method of accounting has been applied.
The unaudited pro forma combined income statements have been prepared on the following basis: The depreciation, amortisation and other impacts on earnings, arising from the fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities recognised at the date of the Combination, reported in the preceding consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 reflect the depreciation, amortisation and other impacts on earnings for the period from 3 February 2011 to 31 December 2011.
The pro forma combined income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011, reflects twelve months depreciation, amortisation and other impacts on earnings by extrapolating the reported depreciation, amortisation and other impacts in the consolidated financial statements on a pro rata basis.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the impact of depreciation, amortisation and other impacts on earnings, arising from the fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities recognised at the date of the Combination are recognised as the same amounts as those included in the pro forma combined income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The results of Hidd Power Company in Bahrain are consolidated for all periods, because following the Combination Hidd Power Company is a subsidiary of International Power plc.
In the periods prior to the Combination International Power and GDF SUEZ Energy International owned 40 per cent.
of Hidd Power Company respectively, and both groups accounted for their interests in Hidd Power Company under the equity method, as an associate.
For the purpose of the pro forma combined income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010, intra-group loans of 5.7 billion have been assumed repaid as at 1 January 2010, funded by the cash injection which are payments that Electrabel, a wholly owned subsidiary of GDF SUEZ, was obliged to make in accordance with the Merger Deed and existing cash balances of 0.4 billion.
Therefore, the pro forma combined income statement adjustment reflects the decrease in financial expenses which would have accrued on the intra-group loans, and the decrease in financial income which would have accrued on cash balances.
In addition to the elements of the cash injection noted above, 1.413 billion was contributed by the wider GDF SUEZ group for the purposes of funding the special dividend of 92 pence per ordinary share which was paid on 25 February 2011.
This element of the cash injection is deemed to have decreased the net debt of the enlarged International Power Group, with effect from 1 January 2010.
This has the impact of decreasing the pro forma financial expenses for the year ended 31 December 2010.
This impact is offset by a symmetrical increase of the financial expenses as the payment of the special dividend is also deemed to have taken place on 1 January 2010.
The Combination has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of International Power by GDF SUEZ Energy International in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised.
Transaction costs incurred by both International Power and GDF SUEZ Energy International before the Combination are assumed to have been expensed in the period before 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2011 and are therefore not reflected in the pro forma combined income statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 or the year ended 31 December 2011 respectively.
The pro forma combined statement of net assets as at 31 December 2010 gives effect to the same fair value adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from the purchase price allocation as those attributed to the carrying amounts of International Powers consolidated assets and liabilities as at 3 February 2011, the date of the Combination.
For the purpose of the calculation of the basic pro forma underlying earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2010, the historical weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding has been adjusted to take into account the new ordinary shares that were issued on the date of the Combination.
EPS for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been calculated using the average number of shares in issue during the period.
For the period from 3 February 2011, the date of the Combination, to 31 December 2011 this equates to approximately 5.09 billion shares, being the number of ordinary shares of the Company following the issue of 3.55 billion shares to GDF SUEZ on the date of the Combination: and in respect of results of periods prior to 3 February 2011 presented within the pro forma combined income statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the year ended 31 December 2011, the average number of shares is derived from the theoretical number of ordinary shares that would have been issued by the Company in exchange of the contribution by GDF SUEZ of the GDF SUEZ Energy International assets and liabilities, excluding additional cash contributions under the terms of the Merger Deed which had not been made as of each reporting date.
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the theoretical average number of ordinary shares equated to approximately 2.0 billion shares.
