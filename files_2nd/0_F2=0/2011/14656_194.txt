Due to a number of differences between the indices, including both constituents and construction, CPI is expected to be less than RPI over the long term, which means that the defined benefit obligation has reduced.
Following discussions with the Groups pension advisers, this reduction has been recognised as an assumption change that is, a change to the estimate of future inflation which will be used to increase deferred benefits.
Scheme funding Spirit Group Pension Scheme The SGPS is a defined benefit scheme operated in the UK.
The values of the schemes liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of an actuarial valuation as at 31 October 2009, updated to the balance sheet date.
