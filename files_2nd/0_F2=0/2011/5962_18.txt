8 Share-based payments A full description of each type of share incentive to employees is in the Directors Remuneration Report.
All share incentives are over ordinary shares of the Company.
The fair value of incentives is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The employee expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting of the incentive.
For share incentives under the Share Bonus Plan the fair value has been measured using a binomial model.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The material inputs into the model have been: Share Bonus Plan Awards in 2008 Awards in 2009 Awards in 2010 Fair value 456p to 1029p to1314p to 672p 1245p 1413p Share price at purchase 482p to1100p to1438p to 710p 1330p 1546p Expected volatility 30% 30% 30% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends 1.8% 2.2% 3.0% Fidessa group plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Company financial statements continued The fair value of the awards under the Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan EGRIP has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

Fidessa group plc 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 9 Related party transactions The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and with its directors and members of key management.
There are no transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group.
The remuneration of individual directors is disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The amounts owed by and owed to its wholly owned subsidiaries are disclosed in notes 5 and 6 to these financial statements.
The Company leases office premises and provides treasury management on behalf of Group companies.
Rent and service charges are charged at cost, 1,182,000 2010: 1,097,000.
10 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Company, which primarily relate to credit, interest and liquidity, which arise in the normal course of the Companys business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in the Groups treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty.
Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Trade payables Accrued expenses 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 3 months or less 115 58 1,149 898 312 months Greater than 1 year Carrying amount 115 58 1,149 898 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will arise materially earlier or at significantly different values.
Interest receivable and payable The Company holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The Companys overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
Due to the strong cash generation of the business, the Group has no borrowings.
Fidessa group plc 78 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Company financial statements continued Capital management The Board monitors the total equity and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital and when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
The Company maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the Company and its subsidiaries business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
The annual dividends have increased at a similar rate to the growth in earnings per share.
The level of annual dividend provides a regular return to shareholders whilst also providing growth in the cash resources available to fund acquisitions or other investment activity.
Special dividends have been used to return surplus capital to shareholders.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the Companys financial instruments.
For receivables and payables the directors consider that the carrying amount approximates their fair value.
