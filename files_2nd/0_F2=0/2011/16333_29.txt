Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to accounts Group 31 December 2011 1 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and market characteristics.

Revenue by destination The following table provides an analysis of the Groups sales by geographical market.
2011 2010 000 000 United Kingdom 215,227 192,140 Continental Europe 67,882 67,093 Canada 22,123 19,429 USA 333,266 354,920 Rest of World 93,235 76,461 731,733 710,043 During the year there was one direct customer 2010: one, that individually accounted for greater than 10% of the Groups total turnover.
Sales to this customer in 2011 were 178m 2010: 203m across all segments.
These are calculated as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Operating profit 99,215 90,015 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 23,133 20,331 Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 232 - Underlying operating profit 122,116 110,346 Profit before tax 91,179 91,309 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 23,133 20,331 Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 232 - Loss profit on fair value movements on derivatives 821 8,952 Underlying profit before tax 114,901 102,688 Cash generated by operations see note 29 149,318 122,847 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 12,099 15,526 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment - 3,813 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 3,055 3,214 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares 422 1,569 Operating cash flow 133,742 106,351 Underlying operating profit has been shown before acquisition related costs and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, this charge has been excluded from underlying operating profit.
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 were also presented before these adjustments.
78 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 2 Additional performance measures continued IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are stated before changes in the valuation of foreign currency derivative instruments.
The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

Under UK tax law, no withholding tax is required to be deducted from dividends paid by Ultra Electronics Holdings plc.
Subject to certain exceptions for traders in securities and insurance companies, a corporate shareholder resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes will generally not be subject to corporation tax on dividends received from Ultra.
Individual shareholders resident in the UK for tax purposes are generally liable to income tax on the aggregate amount of any dividend received from Ultra and a tax credit equal to 10% of the gross dividend or one ninth of the cash dividend received.
The tax credit can be set against the individual shareholders total liability to income tax on the cash dividend.
Non-UK resident shareholders may be subject to tax on dividends received from Ultra under any law to which they are subject outside the UK.

As the AMI acquisition occurred on 31 December 2010 it was impractical to accurately determine the split of goodwill and intangible assets.
The 2010 balance sheet has been restated to reclassify 9,729,000 of goodwill to intangible assets following the completion of the valuation exercise.
Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash-Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as set out below: 2011 2010 000 000 As restated Blue Sky Group 7,839 7,731 Electrics 9,117 9,117 Adaptive Materials Inc 6,666 7,324 Other 14,274 14,274 Aircraft & Vehicle Systems 37,896 38,446 Airport Systems 28,077 28,028 Command & Control Systems 16,542 16,542 NSPI 11,996 11,900 ProLogic 49,258 28,682 SOTECH 8,372 - Other 8,931 7,823 Information & Power Systems 123,176 92,975 3eTI 11,887 - AEP 17,135 - Maritime Systems 10,067 11,886 Tactical Communication Systems including DNE 37,214 36,995 UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc 18,533 18,479 Other 22,217 22,980 Tactical & Sonar Systems 117,053 90,340 Total Ultra Electronics 278,125 221,761 Increase is due to the Zu Industries acquisition during 2011.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows beyond this period are then extrapolated using a growth rate of 3.5%.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2011 varied between 12.3% and 13.3% 2010: 8.7%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plan and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets that each CGU operates in.
Longer-term growth rates, applied after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 3.5%.
Ultra operates in the sweet spot of defence electronics and considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, but also factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on these calculations and shows that the discount rate would have to increase to 16%, with all other factors held constant, for an impairment loss to be recognised.
Management therefore believes that no reasonable change in the key assumptions used would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
On 31 October 2011, the Groups DNE Technologies business DNE based in Connecticut, USA was integrated into the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business TCS based in Montreal, Canada, creating a single cash generating unit CGU.
Historically, both businesses operated within the C4ISR market with complementary products and core competencies in engineering.
The integration of the two businesses provided the opportunity to derive strategic benefits based on common or complementary markets, customers, products, technologies and engineering competencies.
The integration also provided the opportunity to eliminate duplicated activities.
The combined CGU represents the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash in flows.
As a result, from the date of integration, goodwill has been combined and assessed for impairment as a single CGU.
84 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued During July 2011 and prior to the integration, the goodwill of both DNE and TCS was tested for impairment as standalone CGUs.
The impairment tests were based upon the recently approved five year strategic plan forecasts that had been approved for both businesses.
There was sufficient headroom within each review.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.

Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 19 Trade and other receivables continued The ageing profile of unprovided overdue debtors was as follows: Related Related 2011 provision Total 2010 provision Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 to 3 months 15,090 850 14,240 13,723 550 13,173 4 to 6 months 3,388 585 2,803 4,912 170 4,742 7 to 9 months 294 174 120 324 116 208 Over 9 months 134 134 - 819 125 694 Total overdue 18,906 1,743 17,163 19,778 961 18,817 The Group provides against its trade receivables where there are serious doubts as to future recoverability based on prior experience, on assessment of the current economic climate and on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue.
All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 961 1,112 Foreign exchange differences 1 8 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 1,278 586 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 497 745 Balance at end of year 1,743 961 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 23 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place: one, which was replaced in January 2011, provides 90 million of revolving credit and expires in January 2016 and a second which was put in place in 2010, providing a further 120 million of revolving credit which expires in September 2013.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.50% 2010: 0.85% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had available 129,798,000 2010: 148,819,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allows the Group to issue loan notes up to a value of $150 million.
Loan notes can be issued up until 3 January 2014 and with a maturity date of up to 10 years.
$10 million of loan notes were issued in July 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018: consequently as at 31 December 2011 $140 million remained available under the shelf agreement.
In January 2012 a further $60 million of loan notes were issued with a maturity date of January 2019.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2011, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 3,627,000 2010: 4,448,000, comprising 4,694,000 assets 2010: 6,683,000 and 1,067,000 liabilities 2010: 2,235,000.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 821,000 2010: gain of 8,952,000.
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, had been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps matured in December 2011 and had fixed swap rates, including the bank margin, ranging from 4.40% to 4.78%.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US dollar nil 2010: US dollar 60 million and Canadian dollar nil 2010: Canadian dollar 20 million.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value was charged to equity.
At 31 December 2011, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was nil 2010: liability of 1,618,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 1,702,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2010: 2,224,000.
The fair value was realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis during 2011 2010: one year.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 0.10% 41,051 41,051 - - - Loan notes 4.09% 6,468 - - - 6,468 Unsecured bank loans: US dollar loan 1.79% 78,912 78,912 - - - Government loans 4.43% 1,680 - - - 1,680 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 139 63 42 34 - 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 0.18% 68,129 68,129 - - - Unsecured bank loans: US dollar loan 4.78% 37,434 37,434 - - - Canadian dollar loan 4.40% 12,558 12,558 - - - Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 312 129 82 101 - Market risk sensitivity analysis Currency risks The Group has estimated the change to the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
Introduction Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Interest rate risk During 2011 the Groups borrowings were predominantly at fixed interest rates, consequently the income statement is not particularly sensitive to a small change in interest rates.
The Group has estimated the change to the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2011.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.
1% change Profit before tax 000 2011 Interest rate sensitivity 117 2010 Interest rate sensitivity 280 24 Government grants and loans The Group through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 - 2030.
The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loan has been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreement was signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 - 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward - - Contributions 1,593 - Interest charged to finance costs 87 - Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 1,680 - Government grants credited to profit in the year 2011 2010 000 000 SADI 3,432 - IQ 1,440 1,812 4,872 1,812 94 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 25 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 2.99 million 2010: 2.62 million relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012.
The lower rate of 25% has been used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2011 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.
The UK government has also announced its intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further proposed rate reductions had not been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in the financial statements.
The proposed reductions in the rate are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The main estimated impact on the balance sheet of the 1% annual reduction will be to reduce the deferred tax asset in respect of retirement benefit obligations by approximately 0.8m at each year end until 31 December 2013.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 15.81.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,814,728 2010: 1,856,793.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2011 Weighted average share price 14.10 14.06 14.02 n a Weighted average exercise price 12.22 14.19 14.14 n a Expected volatility % 24.4 24.3 25.5 n a Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 n a Risk-free interest rate % 2.3 2.7 2.5 n a Expected dividends % 2.0 2.1 2.1 n a Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2010 Weighted average share price 13.39 12.58 12.76 n a Weighted average exercise price 11.76 12.67 12.84 n a Expected volatility % 26.3 23.5 24.4 n a Expected option life years 3.7 6.0 5.0 n a Risk-free interest rate % 2.5 3.1 3.0 n a Expected dividends % 1.7 2.1 2.1 n a Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2009, 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2011 2010 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 13.16 13.34 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 28.0 28.3 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 0.0 Risk-free interest rate % 2.1 2.7 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 4.53 2010: 5.00.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options was 3.4 years 2010: 3.3 years.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
The latest full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2010.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 5,076,000 2010: 4,337,000.
Defined benefit schemes The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2011 using the projected unit method.
The Canadian defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2011 using the projected unit method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada UK Canada 2011 2011 2010 2010 Discount rate 5.0% 5.0% 5.5% 5.5% Inflation rate RPI 3.0% 3.0% 3.3% 3.3% Inflation rate CPI 2.2% 2.2% n a n a Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 3.5% 4.3% 4.3% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 3.0% 2.7% 3.2% 3.2% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 2.2% n a 2.4% n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 2.9% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to 5.1% would decrease the schemes liabilities by 1.9% and 1.8% respectively.
If the members were to experience the mortality of an individual one year older, the scheme liabilities would drop by 2.4%.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables namely: Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2011 2010 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 24 years 23 years Future pensioners at 65 males 24 years 23 years Future pensioners at 65 females 25 years 25 years Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Total UK Canada Total 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 m m m m m m Past service cost - 0.4 0.4 2.7 - 2.7 Current service cost 5.5 0.3 5.8 5.4 0.2 5.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 11.7 0.5 12.2 11.4 0.5 11.9 Expected return on pension scheme assets 9.7 0.5 10.2 8.5 0.5 9.0 7.5 0.7 8.2 11.0 0.2 11.2 The prior year past service cost related to the enhancement of cash commutation factors.
Of the current service cost for the year, 4.4 million 2010: 4.2 million has been included in cost of sales, and 1.4 million 2010: 1.4 million has been included in administrative expenses.
The past service cost charged to profit in 2010 was included in administrative expenses.
The impact of the change by the government to base inflation on CPI instead of RPI has resulted in a reduction of liabilities of 3.3m and has been accounted for as an acturial adjustment and charged to other comprehensive income.
