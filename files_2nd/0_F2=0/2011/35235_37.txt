Notes to the financial statements Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 41 Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the tax computations, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In respect of the deferred tax on the revaluation surplus, this is calculated on the basis of the chargeable gains that would crystallise on the sale of the investment portfolio as at the reporting date.
The calculation takes account of available indexation on the historic cost of the properties and any available capital losses.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period, based on Acts substantially enacted at the year end, when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is included in profit or loss for the period, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends payable on the ordinary share capital are recognised in the year in which they are declared.
Foreign currency translation On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statement and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in foreign entities are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction dates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Group income statement.
