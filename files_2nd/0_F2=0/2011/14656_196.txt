The asset was restricted to the amount that could be recovered through reduced contributions to the related defined contribution scheme.
An additional liability of 10.9m has been recognised, being the minimum funding agreed following the triennial valuation of the scheme, completed in 2010.
The pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 20 August 21 August 22 August 2011 2010 2009 m m m Defined contribution schemes 1.3 1.1 1.4 Pension risk The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which are both closed to new members.
The schemes are subject to risk regarding the relative amount of the schemes assets, which are affected by the value of investments and the returns generated by such investments, compared to the schemes liabilities, which are affected by changes in life expectancy, actual and expected price inflation, changes in bond yields and future salary increases.
The difference in value between scheme assets and scheme liabilities may vary significantly in the short term, potentially resulting in an increased deficit or reduced surplus being recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
