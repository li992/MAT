The shares cliff vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment and the achievement of certain pre-defined non-market and market-based performance conditions.
The non-market-based condition governing the vesting of 50% of the total award, is subject to achieving between 10% and 20% earning per share EPS growth targets over a three-year period.
The fair values of the equity-settled award relating to the EPS part of the scheme are estimated based on the quoted closing market price per Company share at the date of grant with an assumed vesting rate per annum built into the calculation subsequently trued up at year end based on the actual leaver rate during the period from award date to year end over the three-year vesting period of the plan.
The fair value and assumed vesting rates of the EPS part of the scheme are shown below: Fair value per Assumed share vesting rate 2011 awards 1,426p 94.3% 2010 awards 1,103p 93.8% 2009 awards 545p 93.1% 2008 awards 522p 92.3% The remaining 50% market performance based part of these awards is dependent on the total shareholder return TSR of the Group compared to an index composed of selected relevant companies.
The fair value of the shares vesting under this portion of the award is determined by an independent valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the terms and conditions of the plan rules and using the following assumptions at the date of grant: 2011 awards 2010 awards 2009 awards 2008 awards Expected share price volatility based on median of comparator Groups three-year volatilities 51.0% 50.0% 49.0% 32.0% Share price correlation with comparator Group 43.0% 39.0% 36.0% 22.0% Risk-free interest rate 1.7% 1.50% 2.10% 3.79% Expected life of share award 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Fair value of TSR portion 788p 743p 456p 287p The following shows the movement in the number of shares held under the PSP scheme outstanding but not exercisable: 2011 2010 Number Number Outstanding at 1 January 1,350,189 1,432,680 Granted during the year 482,379 390,278 Vested during the year 421,309 407,316 Forfeited during the year 53,213 65,453 Outstanding at 31 December 1,358,046 1,350,189 The number of outstanding shares excludes the 8% uplift adjustment made in respect of the EnQuest demerger of 47,335 shares 2010: 82,594 shares and any rolled up declared dividends of 68,073 shares 2010: 64,264 shares.
The 8% uplift adjustment compensated the existing share plan holders for the loss in market value of Petrofac shares on flotation of EnQuest and employees have no legal right to receive dividend shares until the shares ultimately vest.
The number of awards still outstanding but not exercisable at 31 December 2011 is made up of 454,969 in respect of 2011 awards 2010: nil, 368,005 in respect of 2010 awards 2010: 390,278, 535,072 in respect of 2009 awards 2010: 538,602, and nil in respect of 2008 awards 2010: 421,309.
The charge recognised in the current year amounted to US$5,999,000 2010: US$3,208,000.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP Executive Directors and selected employees were originally eligible to participate in this scheme although the Remuneration Committee decided in 2007 that Executive Directors should no longer continue to participate.
Participants are required, or in some cases invited, to receive a proportion of any bonus in ordinary shares of the Company Invested Awards.
Following such an award, the Company will generally grant the participant an additional award of a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares Matching Shares.
A change in the rules of the DBSP scheme was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Company on 11 May 2007 such that the 2007 share awards and for any awards made thereafter, the Invested and Matching Shares would, unless the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors determined otherwise, vest 33.33% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33.33% on the second anniversary of the date of grant and the final 33.34% of the award on the third anniversary of the date of grant.

Once the voluntary and mandatory portions of the bonus to be settled in shares are determined, the final bonus liability to be settled in shares is transferred to the reserve for share-based payments.
The costs relating to the Matching Shares are recognised over the corresponding vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled Matching Shares granted to employees are based on the quoted closing market price at the date of grant adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.

Share Incentive Plan SIP All UK employees, including UK Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in the scheme.
Employees may invest up to sterling 1,500 per tax year of gross salary or, if lower, 10% of salary to purchase ordinary shares in the Company.
There is no holding period for these shares.
Restricted Share Plan RSP Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, selected employees are granted shares in the Company over a discretionary vesting period which may or may not be, at the direction of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
At present there are no performance conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future.
The fair values of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on the quoted market price at the date of grant adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.
For details of the fair values and assumed vesting rate of the RSP scheme, see below: Weighted average fair value per Assumed share vesting rate 2011 awards 1,463p 99.3% 2010 awards 990p 92.3% 2009 awards 430p 70.0% 2008 awards 478p 97.6% The following shows the movement in the number of shares held under the RSP scheme outstanding but not exercisable: 2011 2010 Number Number Outstanding at 1 January 1,003,712 1,082,461 Granted during the year 204,402 203,384 Vested during the year 664,512 176,360 Forfeited during the year 8,822 105,773 Outstanding at 31 December 534,780 1,003,712 The number of outstanding shares exclude the 8% uplift adjustment made in respect of the EnQuest demerger of 27,982 shares 2010: 78,156 shares and rolled up declared dividends of 27,090 shares 2010: 48,474 shares.
