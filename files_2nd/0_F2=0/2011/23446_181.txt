A convertible bond is a tradable debt that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the companys equity during its life.
In the case of Electra, 100 million of Convertible Bonds were raised in December 2010.
Each bond was priced at 1,000 per bond and generates 5% interest per annum payable semi-annually in equal instalments in arrears on 29 June and 29 December in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus.
Bondholders can convert their bonds into Electra shares at any time within the life of the bond expires 2017 in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus.
The conversion price in effect immediately upon issue of the bonds is 2,050p.
The Convertible Bond is listed on the London Stock Exchange and can be traded like other listed securities.
86 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2011 In the unlikely event of Electra winding up, the Bondholders would rank above the ordinary shareholders in terms of being entitled to the capital of Electra.
Why did you raise this money through Convertible Bonds?
The Convertible Bond was raised for two reasons.
Firstly, to diversify the sources and maturity of our borrowing.
Secondly, the Board of Electra believed that there would be a need for flexible capital to help mid-market businesses grow and profit from opportunities in their respective markets.
The Bond expanded Electras capital base and has provided Electra with the necessary firepower to take advantage of these investment opportunities.

Warning to Shareholders Boiler Room Scams Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way.
Many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved by visiting www.
uk register Report the matter to the FSA by calling 0845 606 1234 If the calls persist, hang up.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
