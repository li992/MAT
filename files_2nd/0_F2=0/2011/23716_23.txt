Operating segments From a management perspective, the Group has three operating units and therefore presents three operating segments for segment reporting purposes: F&C: F&C REIT: and Thames River Capital TRC.
While there are different sources of revenue and distinct distribution channels within operating segments, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8: Operating Segments.
Management monitors the results of its three operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Transfer prices between the operating segments reflect arms-length agreements entered into at the time of acquiring REIT and TRC and creating the F&C REIT and TRC operating segments.
Segment revenue, operating expenses, finance revenue and profit loss for the year include transactions between operating segments, which are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Group.
Revenues from the largest client amount to 31.0m 2010: 32.1m and are earned in the F&C and F&C REIT segments.
Revenues from the second largest client amount to 29.8m 2010: 30.6m and are earned in the F&C segment.

Expenses continued c Auditors remuneration Fees paid to the Groups auditor are summarised as follows: KPMG 2011 2010 m m Annual audit fees 2011 0.5 Annual audit fees 2010 0.5 Fees payable to the Groups auditor for the audit of the Group and Companys annual Financial Statements 0.5 0.5 Audit of financial statements of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 0.3 0.3 Total audit fees of the Group 0.8 0.8 Audit-related assurance services 0.1 0.1 Other assurance services 0.2 0.2 Other non-audit services 0.2 0.1 Total auditors remuneration 1.3 1.2 The Groups policy on the award of non-audit services to accountancy firms is outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance.
During the year the fees paid by F&C to other accountancy firms for non-audit services were as follows: 2011 2010 m m  0.5 0.7 Ernst & Young 0.3 0.4 Deloitte 0.2 1.8 BDO 0.1 Moore Stephens 0.1 1.2 2.9 In addition to the above, the following fees were paid by OEICs and unit trusts, for services provided directly to them, for which Group companies are the Authorised Corporate Director or Manager: 2011 2010 m m  0.3 0.4 5.
Employee and member benefit expenses Total employee benefit expenses, including remuneration of the Directors and expenses relating to LLP members, were: 2011 2010 Notes m m Short-term employee and member benefits: Salaries and related benefits 62.1 58.7 Bonus 19.5 16.0 Wages and salaries 81.6 74.7 Distributions to members of LLPs 18.3 6.0 Social Security costs 10.2 10.4 TRC Commutation payment to LLP members 1.4 110.1 92.5 Post-employment benefits: Defined contribution pension expenses 25 h 3.5 3.9 Defined benefit pension expense income 25 d 3.0 1.3 6.5 2.6 Total of wages and salaries, Social Security costs and post-employment benefits 116.6 95.1 Other long-term employee benefits 0.1 Termination benefits 7.6 1.6 Share-based payment expense 26 17.8 22.6 Total employee and member benefits expenses 142.0 119.4 The monthly average number of employees and members including Executive Directors of the Group during 2011 was 952 2010: 1,018.

Exceptional income and expenditure a Other exceptional net operating expenses The Group has classified the following operating expenses income as exceptional: 2011 2010 Notes m m Exceptional employment expense income i 8.7 2.5 TRC Commutation expenses ii 5.7 6.2 TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans iii 4.6 1.8 Operations outsourcing expenses iv 2.7 F&C Partners litigation expense v 1.9 6.0 TRC integration expenses vi 0.2 1.1 F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP income vii 4.8 0.3 Corporate advisory fees viii 9.9 Foreign exchange transfer from reserves on liquidation of subsidiary ix 1.3 19.0 20.9 i Exceptional employment expense income During 2011, the Board initiated actions to achieve rightsizing staff cost savings as a result of the operations outsourcing and the subsequent strategic review process.
As a result, some 8.7m of non-recurring redundancy and related staff costs were incurred during the year in order to achieve the targeted level of recurring staff cost savings.
During 2010 the Group recognised a net 2.5m of non-recurring income associated with employee remuneration arrangements.
This comprised a 4.0m pension curtailment credit arising from benefit changes made to defined benefit pension arrangements, as outlined in note 25 d, offset by a 0.6m past service pension cost and 0.9m of redundancy and related staff costs, which were incurred as a result of cost saving actions initiated during that year.
The Directors consider these non-recurring employment expenses income to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded them from the measurement of underlying earnings in the respective financial year.
ii TRC Commutation expenses The Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams entered into put and call options at the time of the TRC acquisition, which, if exercised, will typically transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
Under IFRS, the share element of the consideration payable under these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
Given the capital nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the total Commutation expense as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
iii TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans As a condition of the acquisition of TRC, the Group established a Management Retention Plan MRP and Management Incentive Plan MIP to retain and incentivise certain TRC personnel.
At 31 December 2011 it has been assessed that none of the MIP performance criteria will be met and, as a result, the cumulative charge previously recognised has been reversed and a credit has been recognised in the 2011 Income Statement.
The MRP expense including NIC recognised in the income statement is 4.7m 2010: 1.7m.
The 2011 credit in respect of the MIP is 0.1m 2010: charge of 0.1m.
Details of these share-based payment arrangements are given in notes 26 e and f. Given the quantum and nature of these awards, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the associated expense credit as exceptional and exclude them from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
iv Operations outsourcing expenses During 2011, 2.7m of legal, advisory and consultancy costs were incurred in respect of the planning and execution of the outsourcing of certain of the Groups back and middle office investment operations to State Street.
The Directors consider these project costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this expense from the measurement of underlying earnings for 2011.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 60 60 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 6.
Exceptional income and expenditure continued v F&C Partners litigation expense Note 24 outlines the background and status of this litigation and details the amounts paid and potentially payable to the founder members of F&C Partners LLP.
During 2011, 2.1m of further legal costs were incurred by the Group in continuing to defend its position in respect of all disputed matters and 2.2m of related interest costs payable to the founder members have been recognised.
These costs have been offset by the utilisation of the 2.4m provision previously recognised in respect of the totality of this dispute, resulting in a net cost of 1.9m being recognised in the Income Statement during the year.
During 2010, some 6.0m of legal and professional costs were incurred with respect to this matter.
Given the quantum and nature of this expense, the Directors continue to consider it appropriate to treat it as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings in both financial years.
vi TRC integration expenses In 2010 the Group incurred some 1.1m of integration expenses associated with the alignment of certain activities within the enlarged Group.
A further 0.2m of such costs were incurred in 2011.
Given the nature of this expense, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat it as exceptional and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for each year.
vii F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP income 30% of F&C REIT, the Groups property asset management business, is held by the former owners of REIT, two of whom occupy key management roles within F&C REIT.
The former owners have the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT by a further 10% through the achievement of stretching performance targets over the six-year period to 31 December 2014.
This earn-out mechanism meets the criteria of, and is accounted for as, a share-based payment.
At 31 December 2011 it has been assessed that the performance target is unlikely to be achieved in any of the remaining performance periods.
As a result, the cumulative charge previously recognised has been reversed and a credit of 4.8m has been recognised in the 2011 Income Statement 2010: a credit of 0.3m.
These credits have been excluded from underlying earnings, as this arrangement is considered to be of a capital nature.
Further details of this arrangement are given in note 26 c. viii Corporate advisory fees During 2010, 7.5m of corporate advisory and related transaction expenses were incurred in connection with the acquisition of TRC, together with 2.0m of abortive acquisition costs in respect of C-Quadrat and other corporate costs of some 0.4m.
The Directors considered these corporate costs to be exceptional in nature and therefore excluded this 9.9m aggregate expense from the measurement of underlying earnings.
ix Foreign exchange transfer from reserves on liquidation of subsidiary Following the transfer of its assets under management to another F&C Group company, F&C Luxembourg was put into voluntary liquidation during 2010.
The cumulative foreign exchange gain of 1.3m previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve was recycled to the Income Statement in accordance with accounting requirements.
Due to the nature of this gain, the Directors excluded this credit from the calculation of underlying earnings for 2010. b F&C REIT put option fair value gain 2011 2010 m m F&C REIT put option fair value gain 8.7 6.4 The fair value of the F&C REIT put option liability, as disclosed in note 28, reflects the value of the portion of the F&C REIT business which is currently owned by the non-controlling interest partners and which is the subject of options.
The 8.7m reduction in the fair value of the options during 2011 has been recognised as a gain in the Income Statement 2010: gain of 6.4m.
The Directors consider the value of these options and movements therein to be of a capital nature, and have therefore excluded these gains from the measurement of underlying earnings.

Exceptional income and expenditure continued c TRC acquisition consideration adjustments 2011 2010 m m Net asset consideration adjustment 0.1 Deferred consideration adjustment 7.5 7.6 The total consideration of 48.6m recognised in 2010 for the acquisition of TRC included a 7.5m estimate of further cash consideration and 7.5m of estimated conditional consideration payable if certain performance criteria were achieved.
During 2011, a payment of 7.4m was made to the vendors of TRC, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, representing an adjustment to the initial cash consideration to reflect the excess of net assets acquired over and above the agreed target.
As the payment was less than the estimate of 7.5m, the excess of 0.1m has been credited to the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS.
The 31 December 2011 conditional consideration performance target was not achieved and it is anticipated that the comparable position measured at 30 June 2012 will not be achieved.
As a result, the associated liability of 7.5m has been released to the 2011 Income Statement in accordance with IFRS.
Due to the capital nature of these items, the Directors have excluded the total credit of 7.6m from the calculation of underlying earnings for 2011.

Income tax a Analysis of tax income in the year The major components of tax income expense recognised in the Income Statement and Statement of Changes in Equity are: 2011 2010 m m Current income tax: UK 3.7 0.8 Overseas 5.7 8.5 Adjustments in respect of previous years 0.1 0.2 Deferred income tax: Relating to origination and reversal of temporary differences 12.7 12.8 Adjustments in respect of previous years 0.1 1.3 Adjustments in respect of Corporation Tax rate change 0.8 0.8 Tax income reported in the Income Statement 4.1 5.8 2011 2010 m m Deferred and current income tax related to items charged or credited directly to equity: Fair value movements on financial investments 0.5 0.3 Net actuarial gains on defined benefit pension schemes 1.0 3.0 Loss on overseas pension schemes 0.3 Adjustments in respect of Corporation Tax rate change 0.3 0.2 Tax expense recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 0.5 3.5 Tax credit associated with purchase of NCI in F&C Partners LLP 2.9 Tax income expense recognised directly in Statement of Changes in Equity 2.4 3.5 Non-controlling interests NCI.
b Factors affecting the tax income for the year A reconciliation between the actual tax income and the accounting loss multiplied by the Groups domestic tax rate for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010 is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Loss before tax 1.5 19.2 At the Groups statutory income tax rate of 26.5% 2010: 28.0% 0.4 5.4 Adjustments in respect of previous years 1.5 Disallowed expenses 0.2 3.4 Non-taxable income 3.0 1.6 Overseas tax 0.2 0.1 Unrecognised losses 0.1 0.1 Share-based payments 0.4 0.1 Disallowed distributions to LLP members 4.9 1.7 Non-taxable income attributable to LLP members 4.9 1.7 Corporation Tax rate change 0.8 0.8 Tax income reported in the Income Statement 4.1 5.8 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 17. c Effective rate of tax and factors affecting future tax charges The Chancellor of the Exchequers Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK Corporation Tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
A further 1% reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate was announced in the Chancellors Budget of 23 March 2011.
The combination of these announcements when substantively enacted will take the Groups UK effective tax rate to 23% by 2015.
The first tranche of these reductions became effective during 2011 when the Corporation Tax rate moved from 28% to 26% on 1 April 2011, leading to a statutory tax rate in the UK for the Group of 26.5% for 2011.
A further rate change to 25% was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, effective from 1 April 2012.
As a result, the statutory rate for the UK Group will move to 25.25% for 2012.
The effect of the rate changes substantively enacted during the year has been to reduce the net deferred tax liability by a net 0.5m as at 31 December 2011.
This comprises a 2.8m tax credit attributable to intangible assets, a 2.0m tax charge associated with the reduction in value of deferred tax assets and a 0.3m tax charge to equity reflecting the deferred tax that is expected to reverse through equity.
The Directors are of the view that due to the significant level of estimation required it is not yet possible to quantify the effect of the proposed subsequent 2% rate reduction in future years, although this will further reduce the Groups current tax charge in future and reduce the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.

Earnings per share Basic loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares at the reporting date.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings as quantified in the Reconciliation of loss earnings table below, more accurately reflects the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

As a result, the reported basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are the same in 2011 and 2010.
All amounts disclosed in the table above are stated net of any attributable tax, as presented in the Reconciliation of loss earnings table below.

Earnings per share continued Potential future dilution The following share-based payment arrangements could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the above calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were either anti-dilutive for the years presented or had not met the relevant performance criteria at the reporting date: Long-Term Remuneration Plan restricted awards F&C REIT variable NCI SBP This earn-out arrangement gives the F&C REIT NCI partners the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2011, the Directors do not expect any of the ownership percentage to transfer.
Any transfer would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
However, the principle of this incentive arrangement is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to NCI as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that, subsequent to vesting, the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would be sustainable.
TRC Management Incentive Plan TRC Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams have put and call options to transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits of their respective Investment Teams to F&C.
The exercise of these options is expected to enhance the profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
However, there can be no guarantee that, subsequent to the exercise of the options, a higher level of absolute profits would be sustainable.
Share Save Scheme 1995 and 2002 Executive Share Option Schemes At 31 December 2011, the 909,900 31 December 2010: 1,318,528 options outstanding have all vested.
These have exercise prices between 139.00p and 240.83p and are anti-dilutive as the option prices are above the average share price for the year.
Details of all awards potentially dilutable, together with the total number of awards outstanding at each reporting date, are disclosed in note 26.
In addition, the TRC conditional consideration payment as detailed in note 15 a could potentially dilute earnings per share.
Under the acquisition agreement, one further potential instalment of up to 10.0m is payable to the vendors where the Run-rate EBITDA performance target is achieved.
While the achievement of the performance criteria would enhance the level of profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent, there can be no guarantee that the higher level of profits which met the performance criteria would be sustainable.

The cost of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment which is still in use at 31 December 2011 is 9.1m 31 December 2010: 8.2m.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill has arisen from various business combinations and, reflecting the Groups reportable operating segments disclosed in note 1, is represented by three cash generating units CGUs, as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m F&C 467.2 467.2 F&C REIT 127.9 127.9 Thames River Capital 16.8 16.8 611.9 611.9 Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually at individual CGU level, or when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each CGU was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2011, as described below: to date, none of the CGUs has suffered any impairment of goodwill.
Investment management contracts management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to contracts arising from business acquisitions.
Management contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives and are tested for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
No such indicators have been identified since the last impairment review undertaken as at 31 December 2008 and therefore no impairment review of management contracts has been undertaken this year.
Management contract impairment losses recognised in prior years relate entirely to the F&C operating segment: the accumulated impairment losses at 31 December 2011 were 218.3m 31 December 2010: 218.3m.
The foreign exchange losses recognised in the year arise from the relative weakening of the Euro over the course of 2011, decreasing the value of Euro-denominated contracts, primarily F&C insurance contracts, in Sterling terms.
The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Remaining Estimated Remaining Estimated Net book amortisation useful Net book amortisation useful values period life values period life m years years m years years RSAI insurance contracts 0.3 10 1.0 1 10 RSAI retail contracts F&C OEICs 4.7 3 10 9.1 1 4 10 F&C insurance contracts 41.6 3 10 58.1 4 10 F&C institutional contracts fixed term non-fixed term 4.8 3 10 4 6.7 4 10 4 F&C investment trust contracts 9.7 4 10 11.8 5 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 14.0 3 10 19.3 4 10 Private equity fund of funds 0.8 13 20 0.9 14 20 REIT property contracts 37.3 47 47.5 57 Thames River Capital contracts 15.4 34 21.1 44 128.6 175.5 Impairment testing of goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2010 and 2011.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget, and managements forecasts.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows reflecting the nature of the Groups business and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that the CGUs will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each operating segment are as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 10.15% 10.15% 12.15% 8.60% 8.60% 10.60% Long-term market growth rate 5.20% 4.30% 5.45% 5.30% 4.25% 5.80% Inflation rate 3.95% 3.95% 3.95% 4.15% 4.15% 4.15% The costs included in year one of the projections reflect those included in the budget for the respective year.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 68 68 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 13.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams included in the respective operating segments.
The discount rates disclosed above are the post-tax rates which have been applied in the projections: the pre-tax discount rates are 12.50% and 14.65% for F&C F&C REIT and TRC respectively 2010: 10.85% and 13.00% respectively.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues are based on the budget for each operating segment, and managements net business flow forecasts for the subsequent four years.
Thereafter, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each operating segment for each period.
Net new business revenues are included at the levels assumed in the 2012 budget and managements forecasts up to 2016 with no further net new business included thereafter.
Additional costs associated with the increased revenues have been included in the projections, primarily to reflect variable remuneration costs.
Where revenues earned from significant contracts with a fixed term are assumed to terminate at the end of the fixed term, the operating costs have been reduced by an amount which assumes associated profit margins of 50% 2010: 70%.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each operating segment for 2012.
Thereafter, both existing budgeted costs and, as noted above, further costs added associated with net new business revenue forecasts have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases.
Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill indicated surpluses in all segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 2010: nil.
The key assumptions noted in the above table are those to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive.
These assumptions, together with the inclusion in the projections of forecast net new business revenues and associated costs, result in the following surpluses of goodwill: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC m m m m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 557.8 16.8 94.4 787.8 44.6 234.9 In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill, and beyond which impairment would arise.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 16.97% 11.02% 30.80% 16.19% 10.36% 39.84% Long-term market growth rate 1.67% 3.49% 2.29 % 2.49% 2.85% 5.93 % Inflation rate 8.39% 5.10% 11.83% 7.38% 6.74% 14.21% Per cent.
Financial investments The following assets are designated as available for sale: 2011 2010 Unquoted investments m m At 1 January 3.5 2.2 Fair value movement in the year 1.5 1.3 Fair value gains transferred to the Income Statement 3.3 At 31 December 1.7 3.5 Unquoted investments include the Groups direct investment, co-investments and carried interest entitlement in private equity limited partnerships.
The investments have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the reporting date.
Included within the unquoted financial investments at 31 December 2011 are 0.1m 31 December 2010: 0.1m of equity instruments measured at the price of recent investments.
The fair value of these investments cannot be measured reliably as the Group does not have access to the underlying information to produce fair value valuations for these investments.
These investments consist of loans and carried interest in private equity limited partnerships.
These investments are managed by external fund managers and the Group obtains income when the investments are realised.
The Group intends to hold these investments until all the private equity investments are realised.
In 2011, the Group received 0.4m 2010: nil in respect of the investments held at cost.
Acquisition of subsidiaries The acquisition of Thames River Capital Group was made on 1 September 2010.
Section a discloses the 2010 acquisition note andsection b discloses the 2011 updates for changes in consideration.
a 2010 Acquisition of Thames River Capital Group F&C Asset Management plc FCAM acquired and gained control of the Thames River Capital Group TRC or the TRC Group on 1 September 2010 Completion date.
TRC is a London-based asset management business that provides specialist products and services to wholesale and wealth management clients.
TRC manages a range of specialist high alpha and absolute return products.
The acquisition of TRC represented an attractive opportunity to broaden F&Cs specialist investment management capabilities in multiple product areas, augment its sales and marketing skills and expand its distribution footprint, thereby accelerating the achievement of F&Cs strategic objectives.
The TRC Group operates its business through two limited liability partnerships LLPs, Thames River Capital LLP and Thames River MultiCapital LLP.
Between them they had seven Investment Teams at 1 September 2010.
FCAM acquired 100% ownership of Thames River Capital Group Limited which, in turn, owned, directly or indirectly, 100% of the following entities at the date of acquisition: Thames River Capital Holdings Limited Thames River Capital UK Limited TRC UK TRC UKs interest in Thames River Capital LLP TRC UKs interest in Thames River Multi-Capital LLP Thames River Capital GmbH As a result of the acquisition, F&C indirectly acquired TRC UKs economic and membership interests in the LLPs.
The consideration payable by FCAM for the acquisition will be up to 53.6m excluding the adjustment in respect of the consolidated net assets target comprised as follows: i The initial consideration: 33.6m was paid in cash at Completion: and The consideration paid at Completion will be subject to an adjustment if the consolidated net asset value of the TRC Group at the Completion date exceeds or falls short of an agreed target amount of 9.0m.
ii The conditional consideration payment: Up to a further 20.0m of conditional consideration is payable, in two instalments, shortly after 31 December 2011 and 30 June 2012, and is contingent on the TRC Group achieving certain financial targets at each of these dates: The first instalment is a variable amount dependent on the Run-rate Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation Run-rate EBITDA on an annualised basis as at 31 December 2011.
This instalment becomes payable if the December 2011 Run-rate EBITDA exceeds 12.5m and the amount payable increases on a straight-line basis from zero to a maximum of 10.0m, which is payable if the December 2011 Run-rate EBITDA equals or exceeds 15.0m: 16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 70 70 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 15.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The second instalment varies according to the Run-rate EBITDA on an annualised basis as at 30 June 2012.
This instalment becomes payable if the June 2012 Run-rate EBITDA exceeds 15.0m and the amount payable increases on a straight-line basis from zero to a maximum of 10.0m, which is payable if the June 2012 Run-rate EBITDA equals or exceeds 17.0m: and The conditional consideration payment, if payable, will be satisfied by the issue of a variable number of Ordinary Shares or, in certain limited circumstances, the issue of bank guaranteed loan notes by F&C.
F&C funded the cash consideration for the acquisition through a combination of the 14.2m net proceeds of a non-pre-emptive cash placing of F&C Ordinary Shares carried out on 28 April 2010, a 15m acquisition loan facility and existing cash resources.
In addition, as a condition of the acquisition, two new share-based payment agreements were established to retain and incentivise TRC Group employees: TRC Management Retention Plan and the TRC Management Incentive Plan.
Details of these schemes are disclosed in notes 26 e and f. The fair value of consideration paid by the Group for its 100% holding in Thames River Capital Group Limited was as follows: m Initial consideration cash 33.6 Estimated additional cash consideration payable as a result of TRC net assets exceeding target net assets 7.5 Estimated fair value of first instalment of conditional consideration 5.0 Estimated fair value of second instalment of conditional consideration 2.5 Fair value of consideration paid for 100% of TRC Group 48.6 FCAM also incurred 7.5m of acquisition expenses relating to the legal, accounting and other professional advisor fees associated with the transaction 7.2m of these have been capitalised in the Company Financial Statements, as shown in note 4 on page 131.
These expenses are treated as exceptional costs, as explained in note 6 a viii.
The provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired at Completion were as follows: Provisional fair value to the Group at acquisition, Accounting as at Book policy Acquired Fair value 31 December value alignment intangibles adjustments 2010 m m m m m Non-current assets: Property, plant and equipment 1.7 1.7 Intangible assets: management contracts 23.0 23.0 software and licences 0.5 0.5 Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 0.1 Deferred tax assets 0.6 0.1 0.1 0.8 Current assets: Financial investments 1.1 0.8 1.9 Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 0.1 Trade and other receivables 13.3 13.3 Cash and cash equivalents 27.2 27.2 Non-current liabilities: Provisions 0.1 0.1 0.2 Employee benefits 1.1 1.1 Deferred income 0.4 0.4 Deferred tax liabilities 6.4 6.4 Current liabilities: Trade and other payables 17.6 0.1 17.7 Employee benefits 6.3 0.3 6.0 Deferred income 0.3 0.3 Members liabilities 3.4 3.4 Current tax payable 1.0 0.3 1.3 Estimated net assets acquired 14.9 0.5 16.6 0.8 31.8 Goodwill 16.8 Total consideration 48.6 The gross contractual amounts receivable at Completion are 13.3m, which is also the estimate of contractual cash flows expected to be collected.

Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The following adjustments were made to the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired: The key accounting policy alignment adjustments relate to the recognition of deferred income and deferred acquisition costs, together with associated tax adjustments, in accordance with IFRS requirements adopted by the F&C Group: An intangible asset of 23.0m, together with an associated deferred tax liability of 6.4m, has been recognised on acquisition, being the fair value of the management contracts acquired with TRC.
Further details of intangible assets are given in note 13: and Fair value adjustments include: the recognition of an investment of 0.8m, being the fair value of F&C Ordinary Shares acquired with TRC, which relate to employee benefit arrangements.
On consolidation, this investment has been transferred to equity as the shares are required to be accounted for as own shares: a reduction of 0.3m to the initial estimate of employee benefits included in the Completion Accounts: and the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments.
The adjustments noted above reflect the Directors best estimate of the necessary fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired entities as at 31 December 2010.
As at 31 December 2010, the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered by the Directors to be provisional.
Any subsequent amendments to the fair values will be made after the TRC Completion Accounts review process has been completed.
No provisions for reorganisation or restructuring costs were included in the liabilities of the acquired entities.
The net revenues and loss before tax attributable to the TRC Group for the four-month period between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2010 were 14.6m and 3.7m respectively.
On an underlying basis excluding the Commutation expense and the costs associated with the TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans, the pre-tax result was a profit of 2.8m.
As a pre-condition of the acquisition agreements, a group restructuring involving the entities being acquired by the F&C Group was completed in advance of the acquisition.
This restructuring was required as the Group was not acquiring Nevsky Holdings Limited or TRC UKs interest in Nevsky Capital LLP, as outlined in the Circular issued to shareholders in respect of this transaction.
As a result, the pre-acquisition results of the acquired entities would have differed materially from the post-acquisition results of TRC entities included within the F&C Group results.
Therefore, it is not considered possible to determine what the F&C Group results would have been had the acquisition completed on 1 January 2010.
The value of goodwill arising on acquisition includes the value of the investment management teams acquired and the value of future business flows that the distribution capability of TRC is expected to generate.
No tax deduction is expected to be available in respect of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of Investment Teams have entered into put and call options which, if exercised, will transfer value to F&C by way of variation of the entitlements to the allocation of management fee profits as defined in the underlying legal agreements and capital profits in the respective LLP.
The exercise of these options will increase TRC UKs share of the management fee profits of the respective Investment Teams by up to 20%.
These options are exercisable: 18 months after Completion: At the option of the Investment Teams, TRC UK will purchase an additional 10% of the management fee profits of each Investment Team.
The option for Investment Teams to exercise this put option is conditional on that teams respective net fund flows being positive for the twelve months preceding the option exercise period.
36 months after Completion: FCAM has a call option to purchase, through TRC UK, an additional 20% of the management fee profits of each of the Investment Teams.
The level of 20% is reduced by the percentage of any profits which have already been commuted at an earlier date.
The 18 36 months options to acquire such management fee profits may be deferred for a period of twelve months if the F&C EBITDA Multiple, which is one of the components used to quantify the Commutation consideration, is less than five.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 72 72 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 15.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued The Commutation consideration may be satisfied in two tranches, at F&Cs sole discretion, by: The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to each Divisional Member of such number of F&C Shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration, or the payment to the Divisional Members of 50% of the consideration in cash at the relevant Commutation completion date: and The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to a Nominee of such number of F&C Shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration Deferred Commutation Shares, or in certain circumstances the payment of 50% of the consideration in cash on the date falling 24 months after the relevant Commutation completion date.
Deferred Commutation Shares shall be released by the Nominee 24 months after the Commutation completion date, provided the Member continues to provide services to the respective LLP or has ceased to do so in certain good leaver circumstances.
At Completion, two Divisions entered into an initial 10% Commutation, resulting in TRC UK obtaining a further 10% of the related management fee profits in those Investment Teams.
The aggregate consideration payable in respect of this initial Commutation of profits was satisfied by: a cash payment of 1.4m: the issue of 3,042,999 Ordinary Shares and the issue of 3,042,997 Deferred Commutation Shares.
The aggregate fair value of the Ordinary Share capital and share premium arising on the issue of these Shares was 3.8m.
The corresponding charge in respect of these has been recognised in the own share reserve, a separate component of retained earnings, in accordance with the treatment of new shares issued to satisfy share-based payment arrangements.
Under IFRS the share element of these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
Further details are given in note 26 g. The cash payment has been expensed and is included within the Commutation expenses outlined in note 6 a ii.
b 2011 Acquisition of Thames River Capital Group update The fair value of consideration paid by the Group as disclosed in 2010 has been revised as follows: i The additional cash consideration paid as a result of TRC net assets exceeding target net assets was 7.4m, compared to 7.5m as estimated in the 2010 Financial Statements.
Accordingly, 0.1m has been released to the Income Statement.
ii The fair values of both the first and second instalments of conditional consideration have been assessed as zero, as the Run-rate EBITDA target at 31 December 2011 was not achieved and the 30 June 2012 target is not expected to be achieved.
Therefore, the total conditional consideration of 7.5m has been released to the Income Statement.
In accordance with IFRS, the release of both elements of consideration have been shown as exceptional income as disclosed in note 6 c in the Income Statement.
The fair values of assets and liabilities acquired at Completion have remained unchanged from those disclosed in 2010. c Acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited Following the review of the Completion Accounts and subsequent fair value adjustments to the purchase consideration for the acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004, there is an estimated further consideration of 0.7m payable to Achmea B. V. formerly Eureko B. V. at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010: 0.7m.

Based on Board-approved budgets and forecasts, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets at the reporting date because it is considered probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.

Financial instruments a Analysis of assets and liabilities at the reporting date Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or at amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other loans and receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact on the level of management fees which are earned from this entity and which are directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.
While F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited has some insurance risks, these risks are fully reinsured, thereby negating any net insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The amounts included in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit-linked funds are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m Fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 447.8 538.8 Loans and receivables: Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 0.1 Trade and other receivables 0.1 0.1 Payables: Trade and other payables 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 25.1 20.2 Total unit-linked assets less liabilities 472.8 559.2 This does not include 3.0m of non-linked policyholders cash 31 December 2010: 3.2m.

Financial instruments continued b Fair values i Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by category of valuation technique: Level 1: Quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table: Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted bid market prices at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments has been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the Subordinated Notes and Guaranteed Loan Notes is based on a quoted market price at the reporting date.
Unquoted investments Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market-related data at the reporting date.
Put options The fair value is based on an external valuation of the business, as detailed in note 28.

The 15.0m facility was utilised to partially fund the initial cash consideration for the purchase of TRC and was repaid shortly thereafter following the issue of a further 20.0m of the existing 9% Guaranteed Fixed Rate Notes in September 2010.
The revolving credit facility expired on 29 February 2012 and had not been utilised.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to nine years, although a significant element of this provision relates to lease incentive arrangements and is expected to be utilised within two years.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases, and the majority of sub-leases, are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
One sub-lease involves the possible receipt of contingent rent.
Any contingent rent received in excess of the anticipated amount is recognised as income during the period.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time, including market rent reviews and break options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.

Provisions continued NIC on share schemes The provision for national insurance contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential employers NIC liabilities in respect of a number of share-based payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards are forfeited and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2011, 2.4m 31 December 2010: 2.6m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 18 a i 2.
Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who went on long-term absence prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the expected present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represents the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
This provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of movements in market levels and the mortality rates of investors.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004.
Long-term service award This provision represents the obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
F&C Partners litigation On 14 July 2011 a judgment was handed down by the High Court in respect of litigation between the Group and the two individual founder members of F&C Partners LLP Partners, the Groups fund of hedge funds business which is now in run-off.
As disclosed in the Groups last two Annual Reports and Financial Statements, the Group had sought a declaration as to the validity of the exercise of put options by the individual founder members to sell their non-controlling interest in Partners to the Group for a sum of approximately 7.8m.
The individual founder members had sought an order that the Group buy out their interest, either at the put option price or at a price determined by the Court under section 996 of the Companies Act 2006 on the grounds that the affairs of Partners had been conducted in a manner which was unfairly prejudicial to the individual founder members interests.
The Court held that the put options were validly exercised by the individual founder members and that their interests were unfairly prejudiced with the result that the Group was required to buy out the relevant interests which it did, on 7 October 2011, for just over 7.8m.
On 28 October 2011, the Court handed down a judgment in respect of the costs and interest of the litigation and ordered that F&C pay to the founder members sums by way of interest and 70% of the founder members legal costs.
The amount of costs and consequently interest payable under the terms of the judgment is to be determined by the Court in due course, but the Board has been advised that it is likely to be in the region of 5m.
F&C has, however, applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal the terms of the costs awarded and the Board has been advised by leading counsel that it is likely to be successful on that appeal.
In that case, it is estimated that the total costs and interest payable to the founder members would be in the region of 3m.
In order to protect its position pending the appeal, F&C has made payments totalling some 2.7m to the founder members in respect of costs and interest, and has also recognised a withholding tax cost of 0.3m attributable to the interest paid.
As a result of the judgments outlined above, the payments already made and the tax cost recognised, the Directors have re-assessed their estimate of the provision held in respect of this matter, resulting in a total provision of 2.0m as at 31 December 2011 in respect of further amounts of interest and costs which could be payable.

Pension benefits The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
A former Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement of 119,000 per annum, which commenced in January 2011.
This pension will be indexed in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January in each subsequent year.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the actual asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
b Major assumptions used by schemes actuaries in respect of benefit obligations i Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used for the main UK defined benefit scheme and the unfunded UK obligation are: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Mortality table for males retiring in the future S1NMA L MC min1% 1 S1NMA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for females retiring in the future S1NFA L MC min1% 1 S1NFA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for current male pensioners S1NMA L MC min1% 1 S1NMA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for current female pensioners S1NFA L MC min1% 1 S1NFA L MC min1% 1 The mortality assumptions for the overseas schemes are: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 F&C Netherlands Prognosetafel 2010 2060 generational table Prognosetafel 2010 2060 generational table F&C Ireland Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates F&C Portugal Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years ii Impact of mortality assumptions To demonstrate what these mortality assumptions mean in respect of the FCAM Plan, the expected ages at death of members retiring at age 60 are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Years Years Expected age at death for a male retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 91 90 Expected age at death for a female retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 92 92 Expected age at death for a current male pensioner aged 60 89 89 Expected age at death for a current female pensioner aged 60 90 90 16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 85 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 | 85 25.
Pension benefits continued iii Cost of annuities The table below summarises the cost of providing annuities of 1 per annum with associated death benefits and pension increases for UK members currently aged 40, retiring at age 60, based on the assumptions used for the pension disclosures: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Male annuity 27.50 25.60 Female annuity 26.70 25.00 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 4.70% 2010: 5.30%.
The rates also assume two-thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse: a five-year guarantee is provided: and pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension will increase by 3.20% 2010: 3.35% per annum.

The Board and Trustees implemented changes to the UK FCAM Pension Plan during 2010.
The changes capped future increases in pensionable salary for past and future service.
These changes resulted in a one-off credit to the Income Statement.
The curtailment income has been recognised as an exceptional item within exceptional employment income expenses see note 6 a i.
For future service the changes increased the normal pension age unless additional employee contributions were paid and reduced the level of pension increases applied.

Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employerappointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and two independent Trustees, one of whom is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the FCAM Plan are required to act in the best interests of the FCAM Plans beneficiaries.
ii Other pension schemes F&C Portugal Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme, Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and F&C Portugal controls the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
From 1 January 2011, this scheme has been integrated into the Social Security system and part of the employees occupational pension benefits is funded through the Social Security system from that date.
However, the scheme benefit structure and employees total pensions have not changed.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 88 88 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 25.
Pension benefits continued F&C Netherlands The Plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council participates in negotiations in respect of potential changes to the Plan.
F&C Ireland The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland.
There are currently four Trustees of this plan, all of whom are employees of F&C.
f Future funding requirements FCAM Plan A revised schedule of contributions was agreed in January 2011, under which the Group agreed to pay a minimum of 17.0% of Pensionable Salaries plus 3.0m per annum in respect of deficit recovery contributions, 0.5m per annum in respect of administrative expenses and any additional amounts required as a result of the asset underperformance guarantee.
Further, to the extent that the Group repays any amount of its fixed or floating rate notes after 1 January 2011 then the Group shall pay, within one month of that repayment, a special contribution to reduce the deficit determined in the valuation at 31 March 2010 in the same proportion as the aggregate reduction in fixed or floating rate notes.
If there is more than one such reduction then the special contributions necessary shall be computed taking into account the aggregate percentage reduction in fixed or floating rate notes since 1 January 2011 and the amount of any previous such special contribution paid.
For the avoidance of doubt, a repayment does not include a repayment of the notes from the issue of a capital instrument specified for that purpose.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during 2012 is 5.5m 2011: 5.2m.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
Non-UK schemes The figures in the table below assume that contributions will continue to be paid to the overseas schemes at the level paid in 2011, with appropriate increases for future changes in salary assumptions.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2010 9.0 2011 6.6 Expected future contributions m 2012 6.6 2013 5.9 2014 5.9 2015 5.9 2016 5.9 g Risk management i FCAM Plan The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the FCAM Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment advisor and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment manager.
The performance objectives are long-term, and the Trustees monitor the investment manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
The results of an asset-liability review undertaken alongside the 31 March 2010 actuarial valuation of the Plan have been used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the FCAM Plans deficit by providing information used to determine the FCAM Plans investment strategy.

Pension benefits continued Asset allocation During the year, the Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided to further diversify the FCAM Plans investment strategy by introducing an allocation to funds investing in secured property leases.
In addition, the geographical allocation of the Plans equity holdings was reviewed during the year, with a larger proportion being allocated to emerging markets.
In previous periods, diversifying allocations to both UK and overseas equity-linked bond funds and an overseas private equity fund have been made.
Previously the Trustees have implemented a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to the investment strategy.
Other allocations to alternative asset classes may be made in the future.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the FCAM Plan.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
The equity-linked bond funds also provide a degree of matching to the liabilities but in addition retain an exposure to equity market movements.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the FCAM Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the FCAM Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas assets.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the FCAM Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ring-fenced from F&Cs creditors and are therefore transferable.
ii Non-UK schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Ireland invests in pooled unitised funds, with returns reflecting the performance of the underlying assets.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
At 31 December 2011, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2011.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the previous years Financial Statements.
The fair value of services received in return for awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the equity-settled awards as these are settled in cash.
The cumulative grant expense for each award is trued-up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and, where applicable, the extent to which the performance criteria have been met.
The weighted average share price during 2011 was 0.74 2010: 0.64.
The weighted average share price at exercise date during 2011 was 0.77 2010: 0.65.

ii Restricted Share Awards Ordinary Shares that are the subject of a Restricted Share Award under the LTRP will vest dependent upon achieving four specified performance conditions and conditions of continued service being met.
The performance conditions applied to the LTRP are determined by the Board, are measured over a three-year performance period and comprise the following: 25% of the award comprises an underlying Earnings Per Share EPS condition: 25% of the award comprises a Total Shareholder Return TSR condition: 25% of the award comprises an Investment Performance condition: and 25% of the award comprises a Net New Business condition.
To the extent that any element of the award has not vested in accordance with the performance criteria detailed below it lapses immediately.
1 The EPS element The EPS condition is based on the amount by which the average annual percentage growth in underlying EPS exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index condition over the three-year performance period EPS Outperformance Percentage.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: EPS Outperformance Percentage Percentage of award vesting Less than 3% 0% 3% 25% Equal to or greater than 11% 100% Between 3% and 11% Straight-line vesting between 25% and 100% 2 The TSR element The TSR condition compares the TSR of the Group over a three-year performance period commencing on the award date with a list of companies in a predetermined financial services comparator group.
At the end of the performance period, the Group and each of the comparator companies are listed and ranked in accordance with their TSR over the performance period TSR Position.
The TSR measure reflects the movement in the value of shares plus any dividends declared during the relevant period.
The awards vest according to the following criteria: TSR Position Percentage of award vesting Below median 0% Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Straight-line vesting between 25% and 100% 16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 93 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 | 93 26.

b The Executive Director Remuneration Plan EDRP Any Executive Director of the Company is eligible to participate in the EDRP.
The EDRP provides for the grant of two different forms of award, Deferred Share Awards and Restricted Share Awards.
There were no outstanding Restricted Share Awards at either 31 December 2011 or 2010.
Deferred Share Awards Awards vest at the end of a three-year period from grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no performance criteria attached to the deferred shares and the vested shares transfer to the participant as soon as possible after vesting.

c F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP In accordance with the F&C REIT Partnership Agreement, the F&C REIT minority partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable NCI was granted as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable NCI is therefore accounted for under IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflected the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
The fair value of the award is reassessed at each reporting date and this fair value is spread over the relevant vesting period.
The minority partners have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%.
The variable NCI performance criteria could be achieved in any year of the six calendar years ending 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2011 the Directors have assessed that the performance target is unlikey to be achieved in any of the remaining performance measurement periods.
The cumulative charge previously recognised has been reversed at 31 December 2011, but would be reinstated to the extent that any performance criteria were met.
d F&C REIT Long-Term Remuneration Plan F&C REIT LTRP During 2010, a new scheme was introduced to incentivise F&C REIT employees.
There are two elements to the Plan: i Deferred Award with no performance conditions: and ii Restricted Awards with performance conditions.
Participants are awarded notional units in the F&C REIT Asset Management LLP Group F&C REIT, each equal to 0.00005% of the market value of F&C REIT.
The market value of F&C REIT is determined annually by an independent valuation.
The Deferred Awards vest at the end of a pre-determined period from grant date normally three years, subject to the continued employment of the participant.
On vesting, the awards are settled by a cash payment based on the market value of each unit at the end of the vesting period.
No Restricted Awards have been granted under the performance element of this Plan to date.
The number of F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards is as follows: 2011 2010 Units Units Outstanding at 1 January 28,859.60 Granted during the year 15,833.33 28,859.60 Forfeited during the year 219.53 Expired during the year 865.16 Outstanding at 31 December 43,608.24 28,859.60 At 31 December 2011 the following F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards were outstanding: No.

Share-based payments continued e Thames River Capital Management Retention Plan TRC MRP The TRC MRP was one of the two new share plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to retain and incentivise key professionals within the TRC Group.
Awards of deferred shares vest three years after completion of the acquisition, subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of one of the two TRC LLPs.
The TRC MRP awards are not subject to any performance criteria.
The TRC MRP includes good and bad leaver provisions.
The number of TRC MRP awards is as follows: 2011 2010 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 21,312,209 Granted during the year 21,312,209 Outstanding at 31 December 21,312,209 21,312,209 No awards were exercisable at either 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.

f Thames River Capital Management Incentive Plan TRC MIP The TRC MIP is the second of two plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to further incentivise TRC employees and members of the two TRC LLPs in the six-year period from the date of acquisition Completion on 1 September 2010.
Awards under the TRC MIP will vest upon achievements of specified financial targets as follows: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards will vest on the date falling 30 months following Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 31 December 2011 is 15.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 12.5m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards will vest on the third anniversary of Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 30 June 2012 is 17.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 15.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: and the remaining 75.0% of the shares subject to awards will vest in two equal instalments on each of the fifth and sixth anniversaries of Completion provided that the cumulative EBITDA of the TRC Group for the four-year period to 31 March 2014 is equal to 100.0m or more.
If the cumulative EBITDA is equal to 60.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between these two thresholds.
Vesting is subject in each case to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of the relevant LLP as the case may be.
The terms of the TRC MIP includes good and bad leaver provisions, change of control provisions and a cash-settled element.
In addition, participants in the TRC MIP will receive an additional cash payment up to a maximum aggregate amount of 3.0m, payable at the time that shares are delivered and in proportion to the number of shares which vest.
The 31 December 2011 Run-rate EBITDA target was not met.
The Directors also believe that none of the other financial targets are expected to be achieved and the cumulative charge has been reversed at 31 December 2011, but will be reinstated should the performance criteria be met.
The number of TRC MIP awards is as follows: 2011 2010 No.

Share-based payments continued g Thames River Capital Commutation arrangements TRC Commutation arrangements Note 15 a outlines the key aspects of the Commutation arrangements which were established at the date of the acquisition of TRC by the F&C Group.
Under these arrangements, the Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams entered into put and call options, which if exercised will typically transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
The members of the LLPs are considered to be providing services to the Group and as a result, the share element of the Commutation consideration is required to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
It is the intention of the Directors to settle these awards in equity and therefore they have been treated as equity-settled awards.
The maximum payable under Commutation arrangements is 81.4m and F&C has authority to issue a maximum of 122,511,485 shares to settle the consideration payable on exercise of the options.
The options are re-measured at intrinsic value at each reporting date and the total expense is spread over the respective vesting period.
The options are considered to have non-market performance conditions if the options are not exercised, then there is no charge to the Income Statement.

Potential number of FCAM plc shares which would be settled as at the reporting date based on Commutation Consideration Share Issue share price at 31 December 23,527,481 25,449,030 No Commutation options were exercisable at either 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
However, at 31 December 2011 some 10.9 million of the shares which would be issued to settle Commutation arrangements relate to options potentially exercisable by the Divisional Members, and 12.6 million shares relate to the options potentially exercisable by the Group.
The Commutation arrangements are exercisable at dates between 1 March 2012 and 1 September 2016. h Purchased Equity Plan PEP i F&C Asset Management plc shares The PEP operated in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and was intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for the compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level.
At the Boards discretion, eligible employees who were awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level, typically 100,000, were required to defer one-third of the element exceeding the threshold into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares Compulsory PEP for three years.
The Compulsory PEP is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three-year retention period.
The number of Compulsory PEP share awards is as follows: 2011 2010 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 783,727 1,396,860 Granted during the year 493,810 Exercised during the year 66,716 1,105,055 Forfeited during the year 25,813 1,888 Outstanding at 31 December 691,198 783,727 Exercisable at 31 December 2,728 13,145 The awards exercisable at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 relate to good leavers.

Share-based payments continued ii F&C Investment Funds At the discretion of the Board, the cash bonus may be deferred on a mandatory basis into certain F&C Funds Compulsory Purchased Equity subject to continued service over either three or four years.
This option is available as an alternative to the Compulsory PEP into FCAM plc shares.
The main benefit of this arrangement is to incentivise fund managers to invest in the funds they manage, thereby further aligning employee interests with those of clients.
The settlement of awards from the Compulsory PEP F&C Investment Funds is made by realisation of the holding in the fund at the vesting date and purchase of FCAM plc shares at that date.
The value of the investment in F&C Funds, the FCAM plc share price and hence the ultimate number of FCAM plc shares to be settled is only known with certainty at the vesting date.
Any dividends paid by F&C Funds during the vesting period are re-invested in F&C Investment Funds.
The awards meet the criteria of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
However, as the awards are ultimately settled in FCAM plc shares, it is not considered possible to reliably estimate the fair value of these awards at the grant date.
This is due to the number of market-based criteria which ultimately combine to determine the number and value of FCAM plc shares settled.
Settlement of these awards to employees is satisfied by the purchase of FCAM plc shares in the market.
The fair value of these awards at the year end has been determined by measurement of the equity instruments at intrinsic value, being the quoted price of the relevant F&C Funds, both at the grant date and at each subsequent reporting date.
The intrinsic value is then spread over the vesting period.
The value of the services provided is measured using the ultimate value of awards which vest.
The underlying investments are held within an Employee Benefit Trust.

Share-based payments continued j Share Save Scheme The Share Save Scheme is an all-employee share scheme.
Participants are required to enter into a savings contract with a savings provider.
At the end of the savings period employees can elect to receive cash or exercise options.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire Ordinary Shares at a price per Ordinary Share determined by the Directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options are offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an Ordinary Share at the date of grant.
The number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options are as follows: 2011 2010 WAEP WAEP No.

k 1995 and 2002 Executive Share Option Schemes IFRS 2: Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS and the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 ESOS both granted options before 7 November 2002 and are not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of these schemes.
All options under both schemes have now vested.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.

These fees are initially recognised as deferred income and released to income over the estimated period 2011: four to seven years: 2010: four to seven years for which the investment is expected to be held.

The REIT parties have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0 million.
Ivor Smiths option is exercisable after the third anniversary of Completion and Leo Nos option is exercisable after the seventh anniversary of Completion.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo Nos and Ivor Smiths interests or the holder of their beneficial interests and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The reduction in the fair value of the F&C REIT put option liabilities of 8.7m during 2011 2010: 6.4m reduction has been released to the Income Statement as detailed in note 6 b.
An external valuation of the F&C REIT business is performed at each reporting date to enable a fair value to be placed on the F&C REIT put option liabilities.
The average of three valuation methodologies equally weighted was used to place a fair value on the F&C REIT business, namely: 1.
Market earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA multiple 3.
Fixed EBITDA multiple The main assumptions used in the valuation methodologies are: a Projections of the profit and loss for F&C REIT: Net new business: Based on the F&C REIT approved budget for year one, with management forecast projections for the subsequent few years Revenue growth: 1.5% 7.0% per annum Cost inflation: 3.5% per annum b Discount rates: 12.5% on recurring cash flows 25.0% on non-recurring cash flows c Perpetuity growth rates: 3.0% for recurring cash flows 3.0% for non-recurring cash flows d Earnings multipliers: 9.0 x recurring EBITDA 3.0 x non-recurring EBITDA 16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 100 100 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of policyholder investments at the start and end of the year and an analysis of movements during the year are as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Liability as at 1 January 559.2 649.9 Contributions received 41.6 66.4 Investment return applied 3 13.7 74.3 Charges levied 1.9 3.1 Repayments 139.8 229.2 Movement in contingency reserve 0.2 Movement in reinsurance ceded 1.1 Liability as at 31 December 472.8 559.2 All investment contract liabilities have been disclosed as current liabilities as this is considered to be appropriate to the rights of policyholders who may withdraw their investments at short notice.
The Directors expect that the majority of the investment contract liabilities will be repayable outwith one year.
Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities include life assurance liabilities in respect of lifetime guarantees provided with certain investment products, and annuity liabilities in respect of pension investment contracts where the investor has retired.
These liabilities and related reinsurance balances at the start and end of the year, together with an analysis of movements in the year, are as follows: 2011 2010 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net m m m m m m At 1 January 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.9 Claims paid 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 Change in economic assumptions 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Unwinding of discount rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 The reinsurance liabilities relate to annuity business reinsured with Friends Life Limited.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision for either 2011 or 2010.
No significant gain or loss arose on reinsurance contracts incepted in 2011 or 2010.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used in determining the insurance contract liabilities and the reinsurers share of these liabilities, and the process adopted to arrive at these assumptions are as follows: Mortality rates 2011 2010 Annuities in payment Males: 97% FCMA00: Females: 92% FCFA00 8293% PCXA00 Due to the small number of annuity policies, the mortality assumptions reflect recent experience of the reinsurer together with an allowance for future mortality improvement.
Experience analysis for mortality is performed annually by the reinsurer.
Discount rate The discount rate used at 31 December 2011 is 4.02% 31 December 2010: 4.81% based on current fixed interest gross redemption yields, with a prudent adjustment for risk.

Reserves The analysis of movements in reserves is disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 45.
Nature and purpose of reserves: Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Capital redemption reserve The Capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the capital of the Company when shares are bought back and subsequently cancelled without Court Approval.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the Income Statement is considered to be realised.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation and any impairment charge.

Contingent liabilities Ongoing business operations In the normal course of its business, the Group is subject to matters of litigation or dispute.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to management.
The Groups risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance on page 32.
The Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Groups assets under management and revenues.
The Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information on the Groups direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
Note 37 provides numerical analysis of the Groups financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the reporting date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager, the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are subject to varying financial risks market, credit and liquidity.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Groups revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly, monthly or daily basis, the Groups income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Groups interests are aligned to those of our clients.
A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the heads of F&Cs investment functions is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is considered necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients based on absolute performance or where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Groups interests with those of our clients.
The key components of financial risk to which our clients are exposed are: Market risk the risk of financial loss arising from changes in the market prices of assets.
Market risks include exposure to all asset classes, including equities, fixed income products and property as well as currency risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of assets held within client portfolios.
Credit risk can vary by asset class and individual instrument.
Liquidity risk the risk of financial loss to client portfolios because a counterparty does not have sufficient financial resources available and is unable to realise assets in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can only realise assets by suffering financial loss.
Direct earnings and capital exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position: Market risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Credit risk the risk of financial loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations in respect of financial instruments held by the Group.
Credit risk includes investment credit risk, counterparty risk, deposit and loan risks and country risk.
Liquidity risk the risk of the Group failing to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Group could be required to pay its liabilities earlier than expected or because of any inability to realise assets in order to meet obligations as they fall due or is only able to realise assets by suffering financial loss.
A fuller analysis follows of the financial risks associated with the Groups financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Groups exposure to those risks.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 105 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 | 105 36.
Financial risk management continued Unit-linked assets and liabilities A significant element of the value of the Groups financial assets relates to the Groups unit-linked pooled pension entity, F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited F&C MPF.
As outlined in note 18 a i 1, Financial Instruments, the risks and rewards associated with these assets, which are held by F&C MPF, fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the underlying policyholders.
As a result, the investment contract liabilities included in the Statement of Financial Position are equal and opposite in value to the assets which are held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default, although the revenue stream earned from managing these assets varies in line with the movement in assets held on behalf of clients.
The financial risk management disclosures specifically exclude policyholders unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C MPF as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
Financial investments Recognising that the Groups revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Groups assets to low risk deposits or money market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Groups capital.
Advance Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
The Board recognises that the Group has significant exposure to Euro-denominated cash flows, but at this point in time has not chosen not to enter into any medium-term forward exchange contracts.
During 2010 the Group recognised 0.9m of a realised gain in respect of a historic medium-term forward currency contract.
This gain represented the partial reversal of a 1.3m unrealised loss recognised in prior periods.
As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Group held short-term contracts, to a gross value of less than 1.0m, which were specifically matched to foreign currency assets at year end.
Financial investments classified as available for sale, as detailed in note 14, primarily reflect the value of the Groups private equity investments.
These represent carried interest entitlement which arises from the Groups historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments.
Other financial investments, classified as fair value through profit or loss, as detailed in note 18 a i 2, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historic employee remuneration arrangements.
The Group has no net financial exposure to Purchased Equity Plan, Bonus investments and TRC Employee Benefits assets as the risks and rewards of all movements in the value of these financial assets fall to the beneficiary and are offset by equal and opposite movements in the Groups associated employee benefit liabilities, which accrue over the vesting period.
The NIC hedge economically hedges the Groups exposure to movements in future national insurance contributions obligations in respect of legacy employee share plans.
Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management policy limits the aggregate value of the units held by the Group to 1.25m, thereby capping the maximum financial risk exposure associated with these assets.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&Cs business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values which, once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
In addition, as a significant portion of the performance fees which can be earned by the Group accrue in respect of the calendar year and can only be billed subsequently, the quantum of accrued income recognised in the Statement of Financial Position at the reporting date is generally higher than at other points during the year and is sensitive to the magnitude of performance fees earned.
Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required Know Your Client procedures.
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&Cs larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have an external credit rating.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
As noted earlier, the Group no longer hedges any significant element of its exposure to monetary assets denominated in foreign currency.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 106 106 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 36.
Financial risk management continued OEIC and unit trust debtors OEIC and unit trust debtors include trustee debtors and debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units.
Typically, the Group recognises OEIC and unit trust creditors of a similar magnitude at any point in time.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any shortfall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury position of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Groups cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short-term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the F&C Credit Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The F&C Credit Committees primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any client assets with them and to monitor credit risk thereafter.
Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Groups transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to any restrictions in respect of their respective legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Groups working capital requirements.
Any exception to the treasury policy requires the prior approval of the Board.
Recognising the potential consequences of the recent global and European financial crises, management sought to operate throughout 2010 and 2011 with a maximum corporate exposure to any one financial institution of 15.0m.
Prior approval was given for a limited number of exceptions.
Reinsurance assets The Groups unit-linked pooled pension subsidiary is an insurance company and has some exposure to insurance contract liabilities, as outlined in note 30.
These liabilities are fully reinsured as the Group seeks to have no net insurance exposure.
The reinsurance assets represent the expected amounts recoverable to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has exposure to both credit and liquidity risk on these assets.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Groups defined benefit pension deficit represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 25.
The Group has exposure to movements in the market value of the plan assets, which include equities and LDI fixed interest pools.
Approximately 25% of the assets held in respect of the UK scheme are held in LDI pools, with maturity profiles which match the expected maturity profile of pension obligations.
The market values of the LDI pools are impacted by movements in interest rates.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Groups pension deficit.
Management of capital While F&C considers its capital to be its total equity, this is effectively managed via the net assets to which it relates.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in share capital are shown in the Report of the Directors on page 25.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of new or own shares to satisfy obligations under sharebased payment arrangements or through the purchase of own shares to satisfy future share scheme obligations.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 107 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2011 | 107 36.
Financial risk management continued The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt funded transactions.
During 2010 some 24.8 million new shares were placed in the market to partially fund the TRC acquisition and some 6.1 million of new shares were issued in respect of the Commutation arrangements.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
The dividend policy seeks to achieve a targeted dividend cover of 1.5 times underlying earnings per share.
The Board declared a total dividend of 3.0 pence per share for 2011.
The overall objective of shareholder liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over short and medium time horizons to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Groups day-to-day operational requirements.
The Board indicated that it will seek to reduce net debt over the medium-term, with a target of zero net debt to be achieved by the end of 2014.
While the Board consider this target to be achievable, the Directors recognise that a number of risks exist which could prevent this target from being achieved.
Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Groups Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the cash flow requirements of the Group while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had a 20m revolving credit facility and bank overdraft facilities available to it which provided some protection against any short-term cash-flow deficiencies.
The revolving credit facility expired on 29 February 2012.
The undrawn committed facilities available at the reporting date are shown in note 22 as are details of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
The Group has some 150m of Guaranteed Fixed-Rate Loan Notes which mature in December 2016 together with some 125m of Fixed Floating Rate Subordinated Notes in issue.
The earliest repayment date for these Subordinated Notes is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group to 2026.
In addition, the Group has the option to defer interest payments on this subordinated debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the subordinated debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Groups net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
In 2006, the Group obtained from the FSA a waiver from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
This waiver took effect from 1 January 2007 and was due to expire at the end of 2011.
However, in April 2011 the FSA approved F&Cs application to renew the waiver, which now expires in April 2016.
At 31 December 2011, there were 15 regulated companies in the Group, of which 11 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FSA.
This includes F&C MPF which, being a regulated insurance firm, as opposed to an investment firm, is not part of the consolidation Group for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their respective local regulatory authority, as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
Regulations set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under the CRD.
For the UK-regulated investment firms, the CRR is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm and is calculated using risk weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates and is calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firms relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous years audited Financial Statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit financial returns monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
16272 F&C Annual Report Part 2:Layout 1 28 03 2012 18:13 Page 108 108 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 36.
Financial risk management continued The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that companies have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward-looking exercise which includes stress-testing key risks, considering how the company would cope with a significant market down turn for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All of the Groups regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2010 and 2011.
The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 36 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analyses of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each reporting date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of F&C MPF, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.
a Credit risk i Maximum exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The maximum exposure of each class of financial asset is: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 6.6 9.9 Stock of units and shares 0.9 0.1 Available for sale financial assets: Financial investments 1.7 3.5 Loans and receivables: Trade debtors 13.3 21.5 Accrued income 29.0 38.9 OEIC and unit trust debtors 29.5 81.2 Other debtors 4.8 10.8 Amounts owed by Achmea Group 1.4 Amounts owed by TRC related party entities 0.6 0.7 Amounts owned by F&C REIT related party entities 0.1 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents shareholders 196.9 178.8 283.4 346.9 As the Achmea Group ceased to be a related party during 2011, the balances are now included within other debtors at 31 December 2011.
The accrued income balance is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.
This is primarily due to the level of performance fees recognised at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
The quantum of OEIC and unit trust debtors fluctuates significantly during the year: the balance is dependent upon the timing and values of creations and liquidations of units or shares.

This analysis measures the change in fair value of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments at the reporting dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact that a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% in foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.

In addition, the F&C REIT put options are disclosed in note 28 at fair value.
A 10% movement in the fair value of the options at 31 December 2011 would result in a 4.5m 31 December 2010: 5.4m charge or credit to the Income Statement and to equity.
Impairment of financial assets can also be affected by changes in the relevant underlying risk.
d Capital A summary of the Groups capital and the net assets which it represents is shown below: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m Share capital 0.5 0.5 Share premium account 51.8 51.8 Capital redemption reserve 0.8 0.8 Merger reserve 359.7 383.3 Other reserves 22.8 19.5 Retained earnings 154.3 138.2 Non-controlling interests 12.5 16.5 Total equity 556.8 571.6 Net assets 556.8 571.6 Note 36 describes the Groups management of capital, working capital and regulatory capital requirements.
Insurance risk management The Groups insurance contracts are all annuity contracts which guarantee payment during the lifetime of the annuitant at a specified level or with a specified escalation factor.
They are all 100% reinsured with Friends Life Limited.
The only risk that the Group is subject to in respect of these contracts is the credit risk of the reinsurer.
Given the small amount at risk 2.0m at 31 December 2011: 2.0m at 31 December 2010, this is not considered to be significant.
