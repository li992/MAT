Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 33.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash ows that could be of a signicantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows cash outows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reect the maturity prole of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency interest rate swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $9,099 million at 31 December 2011 2010 $6,725 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outows.
These amounts represent the maximum exposure of the group, substantially all of which could be called within one year.
Other investments $ million 2011 2010 Current Non-current Current Non-current Equity investments listed 876 953 unlisted 252 238 Repurchased gas pre-paid bonds 288 989 1,532 288 2,117 1,532 1,191 Equity investments have no xed maturity date or coupon rate, and are classied as available-for-sale financial assets.
As such they are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss arising as a result of changes in fair value recorded directly in other comprehensive income.
Accumulated fair value changes are recycled to the income statement on disposal, or when the investment is impaired.
The fair value of listed investments has been determined by reference to quoted market bid prices and as such are in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Unlisted investments are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The most significant listed investment is the groups stake in Rosneft which had a fair value of $873 million at 31 December 2011 2010 $948 million.
The fair value loss arising on revaluation of this investment during 2011 has been recorded within other comprehensive income.
In 2011, impairment losses of $12 million were incurred relating to unlisted investments: there were no impairment losses relating to listed investments.
In 2010, no impairment losses were incurred relating to either unlisted investments or listed investments.
BP has entered into long-term gas supply contracts which are backed by gas pre-paid bonds.
In 2010, BP was unsuccessful in the remarketing of these bonds and repurchased them.
The outstanding bonds associated with these long-term gas supply contracts held by BP are recorded within other investments, with the related liability recorded within other payables on the balance sheet.
The fair value of the gas pre-paid bonds is the same as the carrying amount, as the bonds are based on oating rate interest with weekly market re-set, and as such are in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
BP has no investments pledged as security for liabilities as at 31 December 2011.
As at 31 December 2010, BP had pledged listed equity investments with a carrying value of $948 million as part of a nancing arrangement.
As BP had retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the shares, they continued to be reected as an asset on the balance sheet, with a liability being reected within finance debt.
The terms of the arrangement meant that BP could request to have the shares returned at any time with 20 days notice, up to the date of maturity in three tranches, up to December 2013, subject to repayment of the outstanding loan.
The nancing arrangement was terminated during 2011.
