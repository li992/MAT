Man Group plc 61 Annual Report 2011 The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is covered in Note 19.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end was $177 million 2010: $65 million which had a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2 years.
The increase in the balance primarily results from the acquisition of GLG.
Base salaries and the amortisation of deferred compensation are fixed expenses.
The discretionary bonus element of compensation, which comprises 33% of total compensation, is variable with the performance of the business economics.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, following the communication of the formal plan, and include payments in lieu of notice and enhanced termination costs.
Included in restructuring costs of $55 million are termination costs of $43 million 2010: $13 million of which $17 million relates to payment on severance arrangements established before the acquisition of GLG to certain key individuals in GLG and $12 million in accelerated share-based payment charges 2010: $6 million.

The other cost annual expense base of GLG was $98 million at the date of the acquisition.

Outside that range the size of the employee base is actively managed to preserve operating leverage and the sustainability of margins.
