106 notes to tHe financial statements notes to the finanCial statements 1 Segment reporting ifRs 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
the groups chief operating decision maker is deemed to be the executive committee comprising peter crook chief executive, andrew fisher finance director and chris gillespie managing director, ccd whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
the groups segments comprise ccd, Vanquis Bank and central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the executive committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
the executive committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the group financial statements.

in order to align the weekly Home credit business with the groups financial year, Home credits 2010 financial year included 53 weeks whilst its 2011 financial year includes 52 weeks.
Revenue in ccd fell by 1.0% in 2011 due to 2010 including an extra trading week approximately 13m impact and as a result of the fall in Home credits revenue yield from 93.0% of average receivables in 2010 to 89.0% in 2011. this reflects the focus on serving good-quality existing customers who tend to be served with slightly longer-term products which carry a lower yield.
the 31.9% growth in revenue in Vanquis Bank in 2011 reflects the 27.0% increase in customer numbers in the year together with the continued success of the credit line increase programme to existing customers.
central costs reflect the cost of the groups corporate office including legal, finance, treasury, tax, pensions, internal audit, community programme and media and corporate affairs costs.
the costs have increased in 2011 due to higher share-based incentives, following awards made under the performance share plan psp in 2011 whereas there were no awards made in 2010, higher levels of investment in the community programme and an increase in legal and regulatory costs.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.
The exceptional cost in 2010 of 2.5m represented the write down of residual property, plant and equipment following CCDs move into a new head office building in October 2010 see note 12.
The groups operations operate solely in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 23.0m 2010: 7.2m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
the intra-group elimination rebases ccds borrowings to 80% of receivables to bring their borrowings in line with the groups target gearing ratio of 3.5times.
this adjustment essentially eliminates goodwill and intercompany borrowings arising following the capital restructuring of the group in the late 1990s.
Vanquis Banks borrowings broadly equate to 80% of receivables in line with their regulatory capital requirement.

interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
it is calculated as profit before tax and interest divided by interest costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
interest cover in 2011 was 3.3 times in 2011 compared with 3.1 times in 2010.

As a result of the change in UK corporation tax rate which is effective from 1 April 2012, deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
The temporary differences on which deferred tax balances have been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2012 2010: 1 April 2011.
Accordingly, the balances have been calculated using a rate of 25% 2010: 27%.
A tax charge of 0.3m in 2011 2010: 0.2m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of this change.
An additional deferred tax charge of 0.1m in 2011 2010: credit of 0.2m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income, reflecting the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rates on items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

Basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
diluted eps calculates the effect on eps assuming all of the groups share options outstanding crystallise.
the group also presents an adjusted eps, excluding the impact of any exceptional costs.
for diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
for share options and awards, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards.
the number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options and awards.

If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 2 May 2012, this dividend will be paid on 21June 2012 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 18 May 2012.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31December 2011 as it is subject to shareholder approval.
at the time of the demerger of the international business in 2007, the board stated its intention to maintain the full-year dividend at 63.5p per share until a dividend cover of 1.25 times was reached and thereafter adopt a progressive dividend profile whilst maintaining a minimum dividend cover of at least 1.25 times.
during 2011, the 12.2% growth in profit before tax has allowed the group to increase its interim dividend by 5.1% and the final proposed dividend by 11.0% together an 8.7% increase in the full-year dividend.
as a result, dividend cover in 2011 was 1.30 times up from 1.24 times in 2010.

following this review, property, plant and equipment with a cost of 28.4m, accumulated depreciation of 28.4m and a net book value of nil, were written off the register.
the remaining property, plant and equipment disposals primarily reflect the disposal of motor vehicles in ccd.

Vanquis Banks receivables grew by 31.4% in 2011 as a result of growth in customer numbers of 27.0% together with the success of the credit line increase programme to good-quality existing customers through the low and grow approach to lending.
The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 102% for CCD 2010: 105% and 34% for Vanquis Bank 2010: 35%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is 5.8 months 2010: 6.0 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 1.5% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
Company number 668987 Provident Financial Plc annual rePort & Financial StatementS 2011 116 notes to tHe financial statements continued 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 1.8 billion 2010: 1.5 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cashflows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
there are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank which are past due but not impaired.
in Home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cashflows from loans deteriorate materially.
the marginal shift in the arrears profile within ccd in 2011 reflects lower new customer recruitment during the seasonal peak in trading in the run-up to the year end compared with the same weeks in 2010. the majority of such recruits will remain in order through the end of the calendar year and those that do fall into arrears will do so during the first quarter of the following year.
the favourable change in profile in Vanquis Bank reflects a strong impairment performance and record low delinquency.
The following table sets out the ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances within the Home Credit business of CCD based on contractual arrears since the inception of the loan: Group 2011 2010 Ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances m m One week overdue 89.8 82.5 Two weeks overdue 22.5 27.8 Three weeks or more overdue 26.2 29.3 Past due but not impaired 138.5 139.6 Impairment in Vanquis Bank is deducted from the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers by the use of an allowance account.
The movement in the allowance account during the year is as follows: Group 2011 2010 Vanquis Bank allowance account m m At 1 January 45.9 40.0 Charge for the year 76.9 63.9 Amounts written off during the year 71.0 64.1 Amounts recovered during the year 10.6 6.1 At 31 December 62.4 45.9 the core customer it platform within the Home credit business of ccd is cash based.
this reflects the fact that the business provides a product whereby all charges are fixed at the outset through the service charge and the focus of the field force is on collecting cash.
as a result, the system records the total contractual outstanding amount due from a customer comprising the amount lent to the customer plus the service charge on the loan less cash repayments to date.
the system does not accrue interest revenue as is the case with Vanquis Bank and more mainstream lenders.
in order to translate the cash transactions from the core Home credit customer it platform into an ifRs receivables balance, a separate database is used.
ifRs permits revenue and impairment to be performed on a portfolio basis.
accordingly, Home credits loans are allocated into portfolios based on their product length.
initial recognition within each portfolio is the cash amount advanced to customers.
Revenue is applied to each portfolio as a whole based on the effective interest rate of that product.
Weekly cash repayments are deducted from each portfolio as cash is collected to arrive at a carrying value.
on a weekly basis, an impairment review is conducted.
accounts within individual portfolios are placed into arrears stages based on the number of weekly payments missed in the last 12 weeks.
the current carrying value of each arrears stage is then compared with the expected cashflows based on historic performance of each arrears stage discounted at the original effective interest rate the net carrying value.
the net carrying value is the carrying value to which revenue, cash repayments and impairment are applied in the future and the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the net carrying value is recorded as an impairment charge in the income statement.
as revenue and impairment is calculated on the net receivable, a separate gross receivable and allowance or provision account similar to Vanquis Bank and more mainstream banks is not maintained.
Vanquis Banks systems are interest bearing and allow revenue and impairment to be calculated on an account by account basis and, therefore, it discloses a gross receivable and an allowance account.
Whilst Home credit and Vanquis Bank adopt different accounting approaches to recording receivables, the carrying value of receivables in the balance sheet and the income statement impact of revenue and impairment is not affected.
Provident Financial Plc annual rePort & Financial StatementS 2011 Company number 668987 Financial statements 117 14 Amounts receivable from customers continued The impairment charge in respect of amounts receivable from customers reflected within operating costs can be analysed as follows: Group 2011 2010 Impairment charge on amounts receivable from customers m m CCD 223.8 232.7 Vanquis Bank 76.9 63.9 Total group 300.7 296.6 the reduction in impairment in ccd reflects an additional trading week in 2010 approximately 4m impact together with an improvement in the quality of the receivables book from the tighter underwriting stance and the enhancements made to the agents commission scheme in april 2011 which provide greater focus on early stage arrears.
accordingly, impairment as a percentage of revenue fell from 32.9% in 2010 to 32.1% in 2011. impairment in Vanquis Bank increased by 20.3% in 2011 compared with a 35.3% increase in average receivables.
this reflects the continued improvement in the underlying quality of the receivables book, resulting from the progressive tightening of underwriting between 2007 and 2009 and the success of the credit line increase programme.
Interest income recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired can be analysed as follows: Group 2011 2010 Interest income recognised on impaired amounts receivable from customers m m CCD 346.7 358.4 Vanquis Bank 19.4 16.7 Total group 366.1 375.1 ifRs requires interest revenue to be recognised on the net carrying value of a receivable after deductions for impairment and not on the outstanding amount of the loan prior to impairment.
Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 515.8m subject to the normal suspension of interest where applicable and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for ifRs purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 453.4m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 62.4m.
the non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more mainstream customers.
as the group recognises impairment events early after missing 2 weeks payments in the last 12weeks in Home credit and after missing 1 months payment in Vanquis Bank the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2011 2010 Currency profile of amounts receivable from customers m m Sterling 1,274.7 1,165.0 Euro 58.0 54.3 Total group 1,332.7 1,219.3 euro receivables represent loans issued by Home credit in the Republic of ireland, and amount to approximately 6.5% of ccds receivables.

a Hedging reserve movements the fair value of derivatives is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
generally, providing the derivatives meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivatives caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
the groups current derivatives all meet these criteria.
if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
the groups Us private placement borrowings denominated in Us dollars are recognised in the balance sheet at the year-end exchange rate.
as these borrowings are subject to cross currency swaps which fix the translation rate of the borrowings the difference between the borrowing based on the contracted rate of exchange and the borrowing based on the year end rate of exchange is recorded in the hedging reserve.
the value of this adjustment at 31 december 2011 is 11.2m 2010: 13.2m.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised asfollows: Group Company 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Interest rate swaps 1.6 7.6 1.6 7.6 2003 cross-currency swaps 0.3 0.1 2004 cross-currency swaps 0.3 0.1 Foreign exchange contracts 0.4 Net credit to the hedging reserve 1.4 7.6 1.6 7.6 Under IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cashflows, using appropriate observable rates.

c Interest rate swaps The group and company use interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the groups borrowings.
The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cashflow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2011 2010 m m Liability at 1 January 14.8 24.6 Credited to the hedging reserve 1.6 7.6 Movement in fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps credited to the income statement 1.6 2.2 Cash settlement of interest rate swaps 2.1 Liability at 31 December 9.5 14.8 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted Weighted Weighted Range of average Weighted Range of average average interest period to average interest period to interest rate rates maturity interest rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 2.0 1.0 - 3.4 1.4 3.3 3.13.5 0.9 Euro 1.9 1.82.0 0.7 d Cross-currency swaps The group and company use cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2001, 2003 and 2004.
2001 and 2003 private placement loan notes The group and company have put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the 2001 and 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes.
These swaps were designated as cashflow hedges and were effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31 December 2011.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange movements on the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes matured in 2011 in line with the underlying borrowings and, therefore, have a weighted average interest rate of nil at 31 December 2011 2010: 7.6%, an interest rate of nil 2010: 7.6% and a weighted average period to maturity of nil years 2010: 0.4 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group and company 2011 2010 m m Liability at 1 January 1.4 1.9 Exchange rate movement 1.4 0.5 Liability at 31 December 1.4 The difference between the translation of the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes at the yearend exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to nil 2010: credit of 1.4m.
The exchange rate movement of 1.4m debit 2010: 0.5m debit reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
Corresponding entries are made within borrowings.

The exchange rate movement of 0.2m debit 2010: 2.8m debit reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
The amount charged credited to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps and the exchange rate movements described above.
2004 private placement loan notes The group has put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the US dollar private placement loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate sterling-denominated interest liabilities.
The swaps comprise both cashflow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cashflow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cashflow hedges and continue to be effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31 December 2011.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates from LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% 2010: LIBOR 1.58% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 2.6 years 2010: 2.7 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2011 2010 m m Asset at 1 January 15.5 12.5 Exchange rate movement 3.6 3.1 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.3 0.1 Asset at 31 December 11.6 15.5 The difference between the translation of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to 10.9m debit 2010: debit of 14.5m.
The exchange rate movement of 3.6m credit 2010: 3.1m debit reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cashflow hedge portion of the cross-currency swaps and the cashflow hedge portion of the exchange rate movements described above.
e Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland.
An asset of 0.3m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31 December 2011 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2010: liability of 0.1m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 6.7m 2010: 9.8m.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 14 February 2012 to 13 November 2012 2010: 11 January 2011 to 11 August 2011.
These contracts were designated as cashflow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.4m has been credited to the hedging reserve within equity 2010: nil.

18 Retirement benefit asset a Pension schemes defined benefit the retirement benefit asset reflects the difference between the present value of the groups obligation to current and past employees to provide a defined benefit pension and the fair value of assets held to meet that obligation.
as at 31 december 2011, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
the groups defined benefit pension scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1 January 2003.
The Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme covers 61% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements, from 1 April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
The most recent actuarial valuation of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out as at 1June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on this valuation updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect anticipated long-term real rates of return.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds and that the term of the instruments chosen should be consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligations.
In the UK, this is usually interpreted to mean the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds of an appropriate term.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would increase decrease the retirement benefit asset by approximately 10m 2010: 9m.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of self-administered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and The projections are combined with the medium cohort improvement factors in order to predict future improvements in life expectancy, subject to an annual minimum rate of improvement of 1%.
In more simple terms, it is now assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 23 years if they are male 2010: 23 years and for a further 25 years if they are female 2010: 25 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the scheme, the retirement benefit asset would have been reduced by approximately 20m 2010: 16m.

Company number 668987 Provident Financial Plc annual rePort & Financial StatementS 2011 128 notes to tHe financial statements continued 19 Deferred tax deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset, resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivatives, the groups pension asset and property, plant and equipment which are depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
The temporary differences, on which deferred tax balances have been calculated are expected to reverse after 1 April 2012 2010: 1 April 2011.
Accordingly, the balances have been calculated using a tax rate of 25% 2010: 27%.
The movement in the deferred tax asset during the year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2011 2010 2011 2010 Asset m m m m At 1 January 2.8 7.7 1.9 5.2 Charge credit to the income statement note 5 4.3 1.4 0.1 0.7 Credit charge on other comprehensive income prior to change in UK tax rate note 5 9.4 6.3 1.9 3.7 Impact of change in UK tax rate: charge to the income statement 0.3 0.2 0.3 charge credit to other comprehensive income 0.1 0.2 0.3 At 31 December 7.5 2.8 3.6 1.9 The change in the UK tax rate relates to the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rate from 26% 2010: 28% to 25% 2010: 27% which will be effective from 1 April 2012 2010: 1 April 2011 see note 5.

the fsa requires certain regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer to ensure that firms have a liquid source of funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer amounts to 17.5m in 2011 2010: 10.0m and represents cash deposited in a designated money market fund which invests in UK government bonds.
Vanquis Bank is a simplified firm under the liquidity regime and therefore the liquid assets buffer is calculated as 10% to 20% of retail deposits taken, principally depending on maturity, plus 25% of the undrawn credit lines on credit cards.
currently, under the fsas transitional arrangements, firms are only required to hold 30% of the amount calculated under the simplified regime.
this increases to 50% in march 2012, 70% in July 2013 and to 100% in January 2016.

When a share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the current share price, probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
the fair value of all options is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
the increase in the share-based payment charge from 6.4m in 2010 to 8.0m in 2011, principally reflects the fact that an award has been made under the psp in 2011. a similar award was not made in 2010.
The charge to the income statement in 2011 was 8.0m for the group 2010: 6.4m and 4.0m for the company 2010: 2.9m.
