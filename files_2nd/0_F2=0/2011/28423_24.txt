372 Financial statements | Notes on the parent company financial statements Notes on the parent company financial statements 1 Nature of operations Prudential plc the Company is a parent holding company.
The Company together with its subsidiaries collectively, the Group is an international financial services group with its principal operations in Asia, the US and the UK.
In Asia, the Group has operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and other Asian countries.
In the US, the Groups principal subsidiary is Jackson National Life Insurance Company Jackson.
In the UK, the Group operates through its subsidiaries, primarily The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC, Prudential Annuities Limited PAL, Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL and M&G Investment Management Limited.
The Company is responsible for the financing of each of its subsidiaries.
2 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company, which comprise the balance sheet and related notes, are prepared in accordance with Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006, which applies to companies generally.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, including Financial Reporting Standards FRS and Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement on the basis that its cash flow is included within the cash flow statement in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption within FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from the requirements of this standard on the basis that the Companys results are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of the Group that include disclosures that comply with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which is equivalent to FRS 29.
The Company adopted the Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2010 in 2011 which included minor changes to FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures.
These changes closely reflect the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and form part of the continuing convergence of UK GAAP to IFRS requirements in the UK.
Their adoption did not have an impact on the financial statements of the Company.
3 Significant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are held to manage interest rate and currency profiles.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Under FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity, or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Financial statements Parent company 373 Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses reflected in the profit and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset against profits arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19, Deferred Tax.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each file separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading profits and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or deficit of the Groups main pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or deficit.
Further details are disclosed in note 9.
A pension surplus or deficit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the profit and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the profit and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under FRS 20, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in the subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

The tables below provide a reconciliation between UK GAAP and IFRS.
2011 m 2010 m Profit after tax Profit for the financial year of the Company in accordance with UK GAAP 3,720 881 IFRS adjustment 5 8 Profit for the financial year of the Company including dividends from subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 3,715 873 Share in the IFRS result of the Group, net of distributions to the Company 2,225 558 Profit after tax of the Group attributable to shareholders in accordance with IFRS 1,490 1,431 2011 m 2010 m Net equity Shareholders equity of the company in accordance with UK GAAP 7,357 4,267 IFRS adjustment 44 51 Shareholders equity of the Company in accordance with IFRS 7,313 4,216 Share in the IFRS net equity of the Group 1,804 3,815 Shareholders equity of the Group in accordance with IFRS 9,117 8,031 The profit for the financial year of the Company in accordance with UK GAAP and IFRS includes dividends declared in the year from subsidiary undertakings of 4,002 million, and 1,318 million for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The IFRS adjustment lines in the above tables represent the difference in the accounting treatment for pension schemes between UK GAAP and IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, the parent companys interest in the surplus of the Groups main pension scheme recognised on the balance sheet represents the element which is recoverable through reduced future contributions.
Under IFRS, as the terms of the relevant trust deed restrict shareholders access to any underlying surplus, not only is the underlying IAS 19 basis surplus not recognised, but the Companys share of the obligation for deficit funding has also to be recognised on the balance sheet.
The shares in the IFRS result and net equity of the Group represent the Companys equity in the earnings and net assets of its subsidiaries and associates.
As stated in note 1, under UK GAAP, the Company accounts for its investments in subsidiary undertakings at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
For the purpose of this reconciliation, no adjustment is made to the Company in respect of any valuation adjustments to shares in subsidiary undertakings which would be eliminated on consolidation.

The UK governments tax rate change to 25 per cent has had the effect of reducing the Companys net deferred tax balance at 31 December 2011 by 29 million.
The change to 25 per cent is effective from 1 April 2012 but is substantively enacted as at 31 December 2011.
The subsequent proposed rate change to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014 is not expected to have a material effect on the deferred tax balance recognised at 31 December 2011.

9 Pension scheme financial position The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme which is primarily a closed defined benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2011, on the FRS 17, Retirement Benefits basis of valuation, the underlying pension liabilities of the Scheme accounted for 86 per cent 2010: 86 per cent of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
However, the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP including FRS 17.
The FRS 17 disclosures are aligned with IAS 19.
Under IFRS, the Group applies IFRIC 14, interpretation guidance to IAS 19 with the effect of derecognising the Groups interest in the Schemes surplus and recognising an additional liability for the deficit funding obligation for the Scheme in the Group financial statements.
Further details are described in note I3 Staff and pension plans of the Group financial statements.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and deficits attaching to the Scheme between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits funds was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 between the Company and the PAC with-profits fund following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2011.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Defined benefit schemes are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuation every three years to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes having regard to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The last completed actuarial valuation of the Scheme was as at 5 April 2008.
This valuation demonstrated the Scheme to be 106 per cent funded by reference to the Scheme Solvency Target that forms the basis of the Schemes statutory funding objective.
Accordingly, no formal deficit plan was required.
However, in recognition of the fall in value of the Schemes investments between 5 April 2008 and the completion of the actuarial valuation in 2009, an additional funding akin to deficit funding was agreed by the Trustees.
The total contributions currently being made by the Group into the Scheme, representing the annual accrual cost and deficit funding, are 50 million per annum.
The current contributions will continue to be made until the next valuation as at 5 April 2011 is finalised later in 2012.
In 2011, total employer contributions for the year, including expenses and augmentations, were 54 million 2010: 55 million.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally qualified actuaries, Towers Watson, for the valuation of the Scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2011 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.

In July 2010, the UK government announced plans to use the CPI in place of the RPI in its determination of the statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
In December 2010, the government published the statutory revaluation order for 2011 which confirms the change to use CPI.
Further, in December 2010, the government consulted on the impact of the switch from RPI to CPI on the private sector occupational pension schemes.
In its response following the consultation published in June 2011, the government confirmed that it would not introduce legislation to override scheme rules which provide for pension increases revaluation on a basis that is higher than the statutory minimum.
Only those tranches of the Scheme which are subject to statutory increases in accordance with the Scheme rules were affected by the governments decision to change the indexation from RPI to CPI.
Other tranches of the Scheme were unaffected.
During 2011, the Scheme communicated to its members the changes in basis from RPI to CPI in light of the government announcement.
The change has the impact of reducing the Scheme liabilities by 216 million, of which 65 million is attributable to the Company.
However, as the Company is only able to recognise a restricted FRS 17 surplus for the Scheme, this reduction in the Scheme liabilities has no effect on the profit or shareholders funds of the Company.
Further details of the Scheme, including mortality assumptions, are shown in note I3 Staff and pension plans of the Group financial statements.

The experience gains on Scheme liabilities in 2011 of 295 million related mainly to the true-up reflecting improvements in data consequent upon the ongoing 2011 triennial valuation of the Scheme.
Similarly, the experience gains of 127 million in 2008 were related mainly to the improvements in the data consequent to the 2008 triennial valuation.
The actuarial gains losses attributable to the Company are net of the apportionment to the PAC with-profits fund and are related to the surplus recognised in the balance sheet of the Company.
In 2011, the actuarial losses attributable to the Company included an amount charged of 268 million 2010: amount credited of 14 million for the adjustment to the unrecognised portion of surplus which has not been deducted from the pension charge.
The actuarial losses before tax of 16 million 2010: 14 million attributable to the Company are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Cumulative actuarial gains as at 31 December 2011 amount to 58 million 2010: 74 million.
Total employer contributions expected to be paid into the Scheme for the year ending 31 December 2012 amount to 54 million, reflecting the annual accrual cost and deficit funding, and expenses.
However, this is subject to a reassessment when the valuation as at 5 April 2011 is completed later in 2012.

11 Profit of the Company and reconciliation of the movement in shareholders funds The profit after tax of the Company for the year was 3,720 million 2010: 881 million.
After dividends of 642 million 2010: 511 million, actuarial losses net of tax in respect of the pension scheme of 12 million 2010: 10 million, share-based payment credits of 7 million 2010: 6 million and scrip dividends of nil 2010: 62 million, retained profit at 31 December 2011 amounted to 5,357 million 2010: 2,284 million.
During the year, the Company received dividends from its subsidiary undertakings of 4,002 million.
Included within this amount was 2,734 million relating to gains made by an intermediate holding company following the transfer at fair value of certain of its subsidiaries to other parts of the Group as part of an internal restructuring exercise.
Because the gains relate to intragroup transactions, the amount of 2,734 million is not able to be regarded as part of the distributable reserves of the parent company.
