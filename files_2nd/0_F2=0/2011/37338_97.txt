In addition, an award of Matching Shares can be made, linked to co-investment in shares by participants.
The participants investment can be made through deferral of an annual bonus award and or through optional pledging of shares purchased in the market.
The maximum level of matching is shares with a face value of 50% of salary for Executive Directors and 25% of salary for senior executives.
On a two for one basis the maximum Matching Shares award is over shares with a value of 100% of salary for Executive Directors and 50% for senior executives.
Awards of LTIP Performance Shares and Matching Shares are subject to the same performance measures over three years.
For grants up to and including those made on 31 March 2009 half of any award will vest based on achieving increases in Normalised Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share NADEPS.
The other half will vest dependent on the Groups Total Property Return TPR equalling, or exceeding, IPD weighted indices which reect the sector mix of Land Securities investment portfolio.
For awards commencing with the grant of LTIP Performance Shares on 29 June 2009, NADEPS has been replaced by a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measure.
Specically, Land Securities three year TSR performance share price increase plus reinvested dividends will be compared against the TSR performance of an index of a comparator group of FTSE 350 Real Estate Companies.
Vesting is on a sliding scale between 0% for performance below the index and 100% for performance which beats the index by 4% per annum or more.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares and or transfer of treasury shares and or transfer of shares other than treasury shares.
For awards made with the TPR performance condition, fair value calculations assume that LTIP and matching shares will be awarded at 50% of the maximum possible under the scheme and have been adjusted for participants who have left the scheme, but no adjustment has been made for future anticipated lapses.
For the market based TSR awards the effect of the performance conditions is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
No subsequent adjustment to the charge can be made to reect the outcome of the performance test.
Adjustments can, however, be made for participants who leave the scheme before vesting.
The shares outstanding under the scheme are to be issued at nil consideration provided performance conditions are met.
