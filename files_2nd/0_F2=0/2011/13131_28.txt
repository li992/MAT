Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management consider the key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements relate to: Carrying value of inventories The Group carries inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value less cash on account.
Due to the nature of development timescales, it is routinely necessary to estimate costs to complete and future revenues and to allocate non-unit specific development costs between units legally completing in the current financial year and in future periods.
A full review of the net realisable value of inventories was undertaken by the Group as at 30 June 2011.
In respect of land where the construction of homes had commenced or undeveloped land that the Group believes it is more likely to develop than sell undeveloped Type 1 land, the Group estimated selling prices and costs of its homes under construction.
These estimates were based on a combination of experience to date, local market research and management experience.
In respect of land where housebuild had not commenced, land could be identified as a distinct parcel and the Group believes it is more likely to be sold undeveloped Type 2 land, the Group judged it appropriate to assess the net realisable value of the undeveloped land.
It prepared estimates using a land appraisal methodology reflecting land as a residual value and used an appropriate financial return to take into account the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.
The estimates reflected managements estimate at the balance sheet date of home selling prices and costs and current estimate of the market required rate of return.
The categorisation of undeveloped land between land the Group believes it is more likely to develop Type 1 land and land the Group believes it is more likely to sell undeveloped Type 2 land is based on the Groups current judgement of its medium term land requirements and prevailing market conditions.
The Directors regularly consider which element of the Groups land bank they intend to develop and that which they do not.
Land which is not intended for development is generally considered as available to swap or sell.
Pensions The Group has utilised assumptions including a rate of return on assets, mortality assumptions and a discount rate having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the retirement benefit obligations of the Group would change.

About Redrow Business review Directors & Board reports Financial information Notice of AGM Miscellaneous information Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial information 79 e. Retirement benefit schemes The Redrow Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme comprises two sections: a funded, self-administered, defined benefit section and a funded defined contribution section, the former of which is contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme.
The defined benefit section was closed to all new entrants from July 2006, having been closed to all but a limited number of agreed new entrants from October 2001.
The total pension credit for the year was 6.9m 2010: charge of 9.5m.
A credit of 8.7m related to the defined benefit section of the scheme 2010: charge of 8.0m, with 1.0m being charged to the income statement 2010: charge of 0.7m and a credit of 9.7m to the statement of comprehensive income 2010: charge of 7.3m.
The charge arising from the defined contribution section was 1.8m 2010: 1.5m.
Triennial Valuation A full independent triennial actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was undertaken at 1 July 2008.
The method used was the Projected Unit Method.
The main assumptions were an investment return of 6.42% per annum compound, salary increase of 2.4% per annum compound, and mortality in accordance with the PA92 series of tables with allowance for the cohort effect medium cohort protection with a 1% pa minimum improvement.
In the opinion of the Actuary, there was a surplus of 9.9m in the defined benefit section of the Scheme, with the value of the Schemes assets representing 116% of the Schemes liabilities.
As at 1 July 2008 the value of the defined benefit section of the Schemes assets was 70.6m.
The previous triennial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2005 and reported a deficit of 11.5m.
Defined Benefit Scheme IAS 19 Valuation Redrow has a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in which they occur, outside the income statement, in the statement of comprehensive income.
This disclosure relates to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
The Schemes assets are held separately from the assets of Redrow and are administered by the trustees and managed professionally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was carried out at 1 July 2008.
This valuation has been updated to 30 June 2011 by a qualified actuary for the purposes of these accounts.
The Company and the Trustees have agreed the following contribution rates for the year ending 30 June 2012: Company Employee Executive members 12.3% 8.3% Other members 9.0% 6.2% Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial information 80 Notes to the financial statements The major financial assumptions used in arriving at the IAS 19 valuation were: 2011 2010 1 Long term rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.4% 2.4% 2 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 5% per annum and RPI 3.8% 3.3% 3 Rate of increase of benefits in payment lesser of 2.5% per annum and RPI 2.4% 2.3% Discount rate 5.8% 5.4% Inflation assumption - RPI 3.9% 3.4% - CPI 2.9% - Expected return on assets 6.1% 6.0% 1 Allowing for the change in definition of pensionable salary where increases are limited to maximum of i each members actual salary increase, ii the annual change in RPI measured at the previous 1 April and iii 2.5% per annum.
2 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned prior to 30 June 2006.
3 In respect of pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension earned after 30 June 2006.
Other pension increases are valued in a consistent manner.
The expected return on assets assumption has been derived by considering the appropriate return for each of the main asset classes listed on page 81.
The yields assumed on bond type investments are based on published redemption yields at the balance sheet date.
The assumed return on equities and property reflects an assumed allowance for the out-performance of these asset classes over UK Government bonds in the long term.
The rates of return are shown net of investment manager expenses.
The mortality tables used in the actuarial valuation were as follows which make allowance for projected further improvements in mortality : For male members: PMA92 with a medium cohort projection and an allowance for 1% minimum improvements year on year mortality rates For female members: PFA92 with a medium cohort projection and an allowance for 1% minimum improvements year on year mortality rates The life expectancies implied by these tables for typical members are: Pensioner currently aged 65: Male 22.9 years Female 26.2 years Future pensioner when aged 65: Male 24.3 years Female 27.7 years It has been assumed that the majority of members will commute part of their pension in return for a tax free cash sum on retirement.

The deferred tax balances in the Company relate to a deferred tax asset arising on retirement benefit obligations of 2.1m 2010: 4.9m.
The Group has considered carefully the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profit will be available resulting in taxable amounts against which the carried forward tax losses could be utilised.
The basis for supporting the recognition of the deferred tax asset is as follows: i Historic profitability The Group floated in May 1994 and, prior to the financial year ended June 2008, had never made a loss before tax since flotation or during the five years prior to flotation provides evidence of historic profitability.
ii Identifiable causes of the losses and likelihood of reoccurrence The carried forward tax losses arise primarily from the exceptional net realisable value provisions created in 2008 and 2009 and to a lesser extent the trading losses in 2009 arising from the challenging housing market conditions.
The provisions principally arise from the reductions in house prices and the reduced rate of sales which have reduced land values.
Whilst the housing market remains uncertain, short of a collapse of market conditions from those experienced to date during 2012, material provisioning is not anticipated to reoccur regularly into the future.
iii Financial forecasts demonstrating a return to profitability The Groups medium term financial forecasting model has been reviewed.
This forecasts increased profitability building on the profitable performance in 2011 and the deferred tax asset being utilised in the medium term.
The Finance Bill 2011, which was substantially enacted on 5 July 2011 includes legislation reducing the rate of corporation tax from 26.0% to 25.0% from 1 April 2012.
The carrying value of the 63.8m deferred tax asset at June 2011 at 25.0% would be 61.3m.

This allowance is based on an estimate of default rates.
1.6m provision was made during the year 2010: 2.0m.
It is not considered that a material amount of current asset trade receivables are overdue for payment.
Trade and other receivables due in 1 to 2 years are 9.8m 2010: nil, due between 2 and 5 years are 11.1m 2010: 0.3m and due in more than 5 years are 10.2m 2010: 7.1m.
The Group holds a charge over the underlying assets.
Trade receivables include 38.8m re the Scotland disposal see note 22.
At the balance sheet date, there is no material difference between the fair value of trade and other receivables and their carrying values as shown in the balance sheet.

Work in progress includes 7.2m 2010: 4.3m in respect of part exchange properties.
Land held for development in the sum of 35.7m is subject to a legal charge as security in respect of deferred consideration 2010: 23.8m.
The carrying value of undeveloped land where net realisable value has been determined on the basis of a sale of land in its current state is 5.9m 2010: 8.8m.
Of the net realisable value provision of 158.3m 2010: 256.9m, 135.0m 2010: 233.6m is attributed to land and 23.3m 2010: 23.3m is attributed to work in progress.
The allocation of land between Type 1 and Type 2 is described in the Inventories accounting policy.
As discussed in note 1, the Group considers the carrying value of inventories to be a critical accounting judgement.
The net realisable value provision movement is analysed below: Type 1 Type 2 Total m m m As at 1 July 2010 192.9 64.0 256.9 Utilised during the year 56.3 39.2 95.5 Created during the year 32.9 16.3 49.2 Reclassified during the year 6.1 6.1 - Released during the year 43.5 8.8 52.3 As at 30 June 2011 132.1 26.2 158.3 The net realisable value provisions of 49.2m and 52.3m created and released in the year are the result of our review at the balance sheet date in the context of prevailing market conditions and the re-assessment of selling prices and costs.
They represent the creation of additional provisions against sites acquired pre June 2009 and the reduction of provisions already in place against such sites as required i. e. a reallocation of the quantum of provision amongst sites where provisions already exist.

The tables below provide a summary of financial assets and liabilities by category.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows at a risk adjusted rate.
All financial assets and liabilities are categorised at level 2 with the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
Financial risk management is conducted centrally using policies approved by the Board.
Market risk is negligible due to the Groups limited exposure to equity securities some limited exposure arises through the Pension Schemes investment portfolio and the associated price risk.
Its foreign exchange exposure is negligible given the nature of the Groups business and its exclusive UK activities.
Liquidity risk and interest rate risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risks are managed through the regular review of cash forecasts and by maintaining adequate committed banking facilities to ensure appropriate headroom.
At 30 June 2011, the Group had total unsecured bank borrowing facilities of 215.0m, representing 200.0m committed facilities and 15.0m uncommitted facilities.
The Groups cash surpluses arise from the short term timing differences.
As a consequence the Group does not consider it bears significant risk of changes to income and cashflows as a result of movements on interest rates on its interest bearing assets.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows money at floating rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from long term borrowings.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group enters into simple risk management products, almost exclusively interest rate swaps.
All interest rate swaps are sterling denominated.
The swaps are arranged so as to match with those of the underlying borrowings to which they relate.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded in respect of these cashflow hedges in 2011 or 2010.
As noted in the Financial review on page 27 during the year the Board decided, taking into account the current predicted LIBOR rates and the pricing of interest rate swaps, to retain all its debt at floating rates.
The decision is subject to regular review.
The following table shows the profile of interest bearing debt together with its effective interest rates, after taking account of interest rate swaps as at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they will reprice: 2011 2010 Effective Effective interest 0-1 1-2 2-5 interest 0-1 1-2 2-5 rate Total year years years rate Total year years years % m m m m % m m m m Bank overdraft 2.5 22.4 22.4 -- 2.8 19.0 19.0 -- Bank loans - fixed rate -- --- 6.6 50.0 - 50.0 - Bank loans - floating rate 5.4 85.0 -- 85.0 -- - - - 107.4 22.4 - 85.0 69.0 19.0 50.0 - The notional principal amounts in respect of the interest rate swaps together with their maturities are given in the table below.
Balance at 30 June 0-1 year m m 2011 -- 2010 50.0 50.0 At 30 June 2010, the fixed interest rates varied from 3.43% to 4.93% excluding borrowing margin and the floating rates were 3 month LIBOR.
For the year ended 30 June 2011, it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by 0.5m 2010: 0.4m.

Maturity of bank loans and borrowings The maturity of bank loans and borrowings is as below: The Group Bank Bank overdraft Bank loans overdraft Bank loans 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Due within one year 22.4 - 19.0 - Due between one and two years -- - 50.0 Due between two and five years - 85.0 -- 22.4 85.0 19.0 50.0 The Company Bank Bank overdraft Bank loans overdraft Bank loans 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Due within one year -- 28.4 - Due between one and two years -- - 50.0 Due between two and five years - 85.0 -- - 85.0 28.4 50.0 The Company was fully compliant with its banking covenants as at 30 June 2011.
At the year end, the Group and Company had 115.0m 2010: 200.0m of undrawn committed bank facilities available.
There is no material difference between the fair value of the bank overdrafts and bank loans and their carrying values as shown in the balance sheet.
c. Amounts due in respect of development land The Groups policy permits land purchases to be made on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39, the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value and nominal value is amortised over the deferment period via financing costs, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The interest rate used for each deferred payment is an equivalent loan rate available on the date of land purchase, as applicable to a loan lasting for a comparable period of time to that deferment.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due in respect of land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Total contracted Due less Due Due Balance at cash than between between 30 June payment one year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years m m m m m 2011 44.8 48.3 32.5 4.5 11.3 2010 37.6 40.0 20.5 13.5 6.0 d. Maturity of Trade and other payables These represent current liabilities due within one year.
e. Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, including call deposits with banks and financial institutions, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables.
It represents the risk of financial loss where counterparties are unable to meet their obligations.
Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial information 90 Notes to the financial statements Credit risk is managed centrally in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
In respect of placing deposits with banks and financial institutions and funds, individual risk limits are approved by the Board.
The table below shows the cash and cash equivalents as at the balance sheet date: The Group The Company 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m AA - 32.0 21.9 7.3 20.8 32.0 21.9 7.3 20.8 No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position of any more substantial debtors.
f. Capital management The Group defines total capital as equity plus net debt where net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the level of returns achieved on its capital base and, with respect to its financing structure, the gearing ratio.
This is defined as net debt divided by equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to deliver value to its shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Group operates within policies outlined by the Board in order to maintain an appropriate funding structure.
The Board keeps the Groups capital structure under review.
No dividends were paid in the year.
The Board has a policy of only paying a dividend once the Group has an appropriate level of earnings cover.
The total capital levels and gearing ratios as at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Total borrowings 107.4 69.0 Less cash and cash equivalents 32.0 21.9 Net debt 75.4 47.1 Equity 458.6 435.9 Total capital 534.0 483.0 Gearing ratio 16% 11% g. Fair values At 30 June 2011 there is no material difference between the fair value of financial instruments and their carrying values in the balance sheet.
