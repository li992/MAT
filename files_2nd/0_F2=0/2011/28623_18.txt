Statement of directors responsibilities in respect of the report and accounts The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the consolidated and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors report, remuneration report and corporate governance report that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Groups websites.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
