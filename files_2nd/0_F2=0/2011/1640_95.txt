25 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately 925,000 2010 670,000 and profit after tax by 666,000 2010 480,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar and Euro reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts for the sale of US Dollar, Euro and Yen as appropriate.
The Group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars, Euro and Yen to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $17.75 million 2010 $24.5 million, 9.5 million 2010 12.8 million and JPY nil 2010 JPY 120 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
