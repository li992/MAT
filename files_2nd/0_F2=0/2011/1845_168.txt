Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UKhouse prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks which include: a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections: the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision: and collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for their customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows: Not linked Linked to to UK UK housing housing market market Total Group m m m 2011 Non-derivative financial assets 169.4 109.5 278.9 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,644.0 1,644.0 Derivatives 12.0 12.0 169.4 1,546.5 1,377.1 2010 Non-derivative financial assets 136.3 582.4 718.7 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2,036.6 2,036.6 Derivatives 39.7 39.7 136.3 1,493.9 1,357.6 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2011 these assets were carried at a fair value of 169.4m 2010: 136.3m.
Further information is set out in note 15.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2011, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 8.1m 2010: 5.2m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued ii Interest rate risk continued The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy.
The proportion of the Groups median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan that should be at fixed rates of interest is determined by the average expected interest cover for that period.
The current target is for 30-60% to be at fixed rates of interest.
Due to the cyclicality of our borrowings throughout the year, at 30 June 2011, 99.3% 2010: 70.4% of the Groups gross borrowings were fixed.
Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Group m m m m 2011 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 175.5 230.3 1,238.2 1,644.0 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 16.5 422.3 1,238.2 1,644.0 2010 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 727.2 202.9 1,106.5 2,036.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 480.0 480.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 247.2 682.9 1,106.5 2,036.6 The exposure of the Companys financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Company m m m m 2011 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 281.8 230.3 34.0 546.1 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 89.8 422.3 34.0 546.1 2010 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 832.0 202.9 29.7 1,064.6 Impact of interest rate swaps 480.0 480.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 352.0 682.9 29.7 1,064.6 Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2011 was 2.4% 2010: 3.2%.
Sterling private placement notes of 65.8m 2010: 77.8m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2011 was 11.9% 2010: 11.8% with, at 30 June 2011 aweighted average period of 7.9 years 2010: 7.7 years for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 145.0m 2010: 125.1m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2011 was 11.0% 2010: 11.2% with, at 30 June 2011, a weighted average period of 5.9 years 2010: 6.8 years for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2011, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax loss would increase decrease by 0.4m 2010: 1.8m, the Groups post-tax loss would increase decrease by 0.3m 2010: 1.3m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.3m 2010: 1.3m.
