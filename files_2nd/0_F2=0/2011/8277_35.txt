The gain on disposal mainly relates to the sale of the Holiday Inn Burswood in Australia.
The other significant disposal was the Hotel Indigo San Diego which resulted in an impairment reversal see note 10 in March 2011 on classification as held for sale.

Impairment charges are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement and all cumulative impairment losses relate to the Americas managed cash-generating unit CGU see below.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs for impairment testing as follows: Cost Net book value 2011 2010 2011 2010 $m $m $m $m Asia Australasia franchised and managed operations 92 92 92 92 Americas managed operations 141 141 233 233 92 92 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period or, in the absence of up-to-date strategic plans, the financial budget for the next year with an extrapolation of the cash flows for the following four years, using growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
After the five-year planning period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on perpetual growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Pre-tax discount rates are used to discount the cash flows based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the business model and territory of the CGU being tested.
Asia Australasia goodwill At 31 December 2011, the recoverable amount of the CGU has been assessed based on the approved budget for 2012 and strategic plans covering a five-year period, a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% 2010 3.5% and a discount rate of 13.9% 2010 14.4%.
Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010 and management believe that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.
Americas goodwill Goodwill relating to the Americas managed operations was impaired in full in 2009.
As goodwill impairment cannot be reversed, there is no sensitivity around any assumptions that could lead to further impairment adjustments.

Of the total amount of equity investments at 31 December 2011, $15m 2010 $3m were listed securities and $97m 2010 $84m unlisted: $61m 2010 $41m were denominated in US dollars, $23m 2010 $17m in Hong Kong dollars and $28m 2010 $29m in other currencies.
Unlisted equity shares are mainly investments in entities that own hotels which the Group manages.
The fair value of unlisted equity shares has been estimated using valuation guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association and is based on assumptions regarding expected future earnings.
Listed equity share valuation is based on observable market prices.
Dividend income from available-forsale equity securities of $11m 2010 $8m is reported as other operating income and expenses in the Group income statement.
Other financial assets consist of trade deposits and restricted cash.
These amounts have been designated as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
A deposit of $37m was made during the year to a hotel owner in connection with the renegotiation of a management contract.
The deposit is non-interest-bearing and repayable at the end of the management contract, and is therefore held at its discounted value of $10m: the discount will unwind to the income statement within financial income over the period to repayment.
Restricted cash of $27m 2010 $42m relates to cash held in bank accounts which is pledged as collateral to insurance companies for risks retained by the Group.

The provision is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount is possible: at that point the amount considered irrecoverable is either written off directly to the income statement or, if previously provided, against the financial asset with no impact on the income statement.

The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and current provisions approximates to their carrying value, including the future redemption liability of the Groups loyalty programme.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Loans and other borrowings continued 250m 6% bonds The 6% fixed interest sterling bonds were issued on 9 December 2009 and are repayable in full on 9 December 2016.
Interest is payable annually on 9 December in each year commencing 9 December 2010 to the maturity date.
The bonds were initially priced at 99.465% of face value and are unsecured.
Currency swaps were transacted at the same time the bonds were issued in order to swap the proceeds and interest flows into US dollars see note 23 for further details.
Unsecured bank loans Unsecured bank loans are borrowings under the Groups Syndicated Facility and its short-term bilateral loan and overdraft facilities.
These facilities contain financial covenants and, as at the end of the reporting period, the Group was not in breach of these covenants, nor had any breaches or defaults occurred during the year.
Borrowings under the facilities are classified as non-current when the facilities have more than 12 months to expiry.
The Syndicated Facility comprises a $1.07bn five-year revolving credit facility that matures in November 2016.
This replaced a $1.6bn five-year revolving facility maturing in May 2013 in November 2011 following a successful refinancing of the facility.

Currency swaps At 31 December 2011, the Group held currency swaps with a principal of $415m 2010 $415m.
These swaps were transacted at the same time as the 250m 6% bonds were issued in December 2009 in order to swap the bonds proceeds and interest flows into US dollars.
Under the terms of the swaps, $415m was borrowed and 250m deposited for seven years at a fixed exchange rate of 1 $1.66.
The fair value of the currency swap comprises two components: $29m 2010 $27m relating to the repayment of the underlying principal and $10m 2010 $11m relating to interest payments.
The element relating to the underlying principal is disclosed as a component of net debt see note 24.
The currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges.

These swaps are held to fix the interest payable on borrowings under the Syndicated Facility: at 31 December 2011, $100m of US dollar borrowings were fixed at 1.99% until May 2012.
The interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges.
Forward foreign exchange contracts At 31 December 2011, the Group held short dated foreign exchange swaps with principals of EUR75m 2010 EUR75m and HKD70m.

Retirement benefits Retirement and death in service benefits are provided for eligible Group employees in the UK principally by the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan.
The plan, which is funded and HM Revenue & Customs registered, covers approximately 545 2010 500 employees, of which 125 2010 140 are in the defined benefit section and 420 2010 360 are in the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants in 2002 and will close to future accrual for current members with effect from 1 July 2013.
New members are provided with defined contribution arrangements as will be members of the defined benefit section in July 2013.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime or annual allowance.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benefits Total 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 6 6 1 1 7 7 Interest cost on benefit obligation 28 25 10 11 1 1 39 37 Expected return on plan assets 29 25 9 10 38 35 Operating profit before exceptional items 5 6 2 2 1 1 8 9 Exceptional items curtailment gain 28 28 23 6 2 2 1 1 20 9 The curtailment gain arises in respect of the UK pension plan and from the decision to close the defined benefit section to future accrual with effect from 1 July 2013.

Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligation are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benefits 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % % % % % Wages and salaries increases 4.6 5.0 4.0 4.0 Pensions increases 3.1 3.5 Discount rate 4.7 5.3 4.1 5.2 4.1 5.2 Inflation rate 3.1 3.5 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year: Pre 65 ultimate rate reached in 2021 9.5 10.0 Post 65 ultimate rate reached in 2023 12.8 14.0 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 5.0 5.0 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The current assumptions for the UK plan are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by 1.75 years for pensioners and 1.5 years for non-pensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP-2000 IRS PPA @ 2012 Non-Annuitant Annuitant healthy tables for males and females.
Accordingly, assumed life expectancy at retirement age is as follows: Pension plans UK US 2011 2010 2011 2010 Years Years Years Years a Current pensioners at 65 male 24 24 19 19 female 27 27 21 21 b Future pensioners at 65 male 26 26 21 21 female 29 29 22 22 a Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.
b Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years relating to an employee retiring in 2032.
The assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
108 IHG Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 notes to the Group financial statements continued 25.
Retirement benefits continued Sensitivities The value of plan assets is sensitive to market conditions, particularly equity values.
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the income statement and the statement of financial position.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

Funding commitments The most recent actuarial valuation of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2009 and showed a deficit of 129m on a funding basis.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the trustees, the Group aims to eliminate this deficit by March 2017 through additional Company contributions of up to 100m and projected investment returns.
The agreed additional contributions comprise three annual payments of 10m 10m was paid in August 2010, 10m in July 2011 and a further payment of 10m is due on or before 31 July 2012, together with further payments related to the disposal of hotels 7.5% of net sales proceeds and growth in the Groups EBITDA above specified targets.
As at 31 December 2011, total additional contributions of 36m have been paid, including 21m during 2011.
If required in 2017, a top-up payment will be made to bring the total additional contributions up to 100m.
The plan is formally valued every three years and future valuations could lead to changes in the amounts payable beyond March 2012.
Company contributions are expected to be $37m in 2012, including known UK additional contributions of 11m with further amounts payable if there are any hotel disposals.

Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.

Deferred tax assets of $44m 2010 $79m are recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss in the current or preceding period.
These assets are recognised based upon future taxable profit forecasts for the entities concerned.
Tax losses with a net tax value of $358m 2010 $411m, including capital losses with a value of $134m 2010 $148m, have not been recognised.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely with the exception of $11m which expires after five years and $1m which expires after six years 2010 $16m which expires after six years.
Deferred tax assets with a net tax value of $29m 2010 $15m in respect of employee benefits, up to $34m 2010 $nil in respect of foreign tax credits and $52m 2010 $5m in respect of other items have not been recognised.
These losses and other deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise as a result of resolving tax uncertainties, or as a consequence of case law and legislative developments which make the value of assets more certain.
At 31 December 2011, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Following introduction of a UK dividend exemption regime, the tax which would arise upon reversal of the temporary differences is not expected to exceed $20m 2010 $20m.
Other short-term temporary differences relate primarily to provisions and accruals and share-based payments.
