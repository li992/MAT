We have achieved this against a backdrop of continuing economic uncertainty, high food cost inflation and the tragic events earlier this year in Japan.
I am immensely proud of the hard work and commitment to achieving these goals shown by my colleagues around the Group.
Our core focus remains on delivering shareholder value from the significant structural opportunity in foodservice around the world and in building our capability in support services.
We are now well into the growth phase of our journey, a phase in which our core aim is sustainable and disciplined growth.
And we are making good progress, building on the strong foundations we have put in place, and retaining our emphasis on operational excellence in our pursuit of growth.
The economic backdrop is still very volatile and is likely to remain so for some time.
Our flexible cost base and the significant cost benefits of outsourcing give us confidence that amidst the challenges of this economic environment there are also opportunities for us.
Our Management and Performance programme, MAP, is fully embedded across the Group and continues to drive efficiencies and act as a framework around which to share best practices between our teams.

28 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Strategic Alliance Group Encouragingly, this year we have seen an improvement in the rate of retention in over 70% of comparable countries.
So, how have we achieved this?
Our best practice retention framework is based on a simple model created by our business in the USA, which we call the Strategic Alliance Group.
It is a semi-independent team that focuses solely on retention, firstly, by interviewing clients to determine how we can improve our quality and service and, secondly, by proactively renegotiating contracts.
This process is systematic and well defined.
Where we adopt this model, we consistently see improvement and were optimistic that the ongoing rollout of this approach will result in a better retention performance across the Group.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
The Group had a small number of outstanding put options which have now matured.
This enabled certain non-controlling shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest shareholding at an agreed multiple of earnings.
These options are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value which is re-evaluated at each period end.
Fair value is based on the present value of expected cash outflows.
The movement in fair value is included in the profit for the year.

S. SOFRA in Turkey from our joint venture partner during the year.
Under International Financial Reporting Standard 3, Business Combinations revised 2008 IFRS 3 2008, the interest previously held by the Group has been remeasured to its fair value at the acquisition date.
This has resulted in a gain of 16 million arising on the revaluation of our existing interest which has been recorded on a separate line in the income statement.
IFRS 3 2008 requires that the interest should be treated on the same basis as would be required if the acquirer had disposed directly of the previously held interest and then reacquired it at fair value.
Prior to the acquisition, the interest in SOFRA was proportionally consolidated as explained in section D of the Groups accounting policies.
The Group has shown the disposal of previously held interest and re-acquisition within note 26 to the financial statements.

The impact of the changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011 and 25% from 1 April 2012.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.

Of the total, tax losses of 16 million will expire at various dates between 2011 and 2021.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the timing of recovery is uncertain.
As a result of changes to tax legislation, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
The unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is 289 million 2010: 128 million.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that this will not take place in the foreseeable future.

Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 83 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2011 8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The adjusted earnings per share figures have been calculated based on earnings excluding the effect of discontinued operations, the UK re-organisation, the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, acquisition transaction costs, adjustment to contingent consideration on acquisition, share-based payments expense non-controlling interest call option, hedge accounting ineffectiveness, and the change in the fair value of investments and non-controlling interest put options, gain on remeasurement of joint venture interest on acquisition of control and the tax attributable to these amounts.
These items are excluded in order to show the underlying trading performance of theGroup.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates and use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates based on local expected economic conditions and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the country in which the CGU operates.
2011 2010 Residual Pre-tax Residual Pre-tax growth discount growth discount Growth and discount rates rates rates rates rates USA 2.5% 9.3% 2.5% 10.2% Rest of North America 2.5% 8.5% 2.5% 9.4% Continental Europe 2.5-5.3% 6.6-13.4% 2.5-6.0% 7.7-15.9% UK & Ireland 3.4% 9.4% 3.0% 10.3% Rest of the World 0.8-5.9% 8.0-14.5% 2.5-6.5% 8.1-16.4% Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
For the UK, to which goodwill of 1,778 million is allocated, an increase in the discount rate of 0.7% or a decrease in the long-term growth rate of 0.8% would eliminate the headroom of approximately 280 million under each scenario.
There are no other CGUs that are sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.

90 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Consolidated financial statements 16 Trade and other receivables continued Trade receivables The book value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the majority of the receivables.
Credit sales are only made after credit approval procedures have been completed satisfactorily.
The policy for making provisions for bad and doubtful debts varies from country to country as different countries and markets have different payment practices, but various factors are considered, including how overdue the debt is, the type of receivable and its past history, and current market and trading conditions.
Full provision is made for debts that are not considered to be recoverable.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the diverse and unrelated nature of the Groups client base.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for the impairment of receivables.
The book value of trade and other receivables represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 18: debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19: and equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial management The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise of cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank, the public and the private placement markets.
The Group has developed long-term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
94 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Consolidated financial statements 20 Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to match as far as possible its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are taken out which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into Sterling.
Where the borrowings are either less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
Non-Sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade-related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups reported Sterling financial position is exposed are the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of Sterling against these currencies on the Groups financial statements is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
This table shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Groups projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis shown on page 96 has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of 1 million 2010: loss of 1 million over the course of a year.
A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits, derivative and forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short-term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short-term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognisedagency.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 16.
Hedging activities The following section describes the derivative financial instruments the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
These interest rate swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur between one and three years of the balance sheet date.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 because the Group creates synthetic floating rate foreign currency borrowings see net investment hedges below through the use of forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps which IAS 39 prohibits from being designated as a hedged item.
These interest rate swaps are an effective economic hedge against the exposure of the Groups floating rate borrowings to interest rate risk.
Net investment hedges The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the change in the Sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 911 million 2010: 885 million.
96 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Consolidated financial statements 20 Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives not in a hedging relationship The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward currency contracts.
Fair value measurement The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair values have been determined by reference to Level 2 techniques in the hierarchy described above.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.

Provisions in respect of discontinued and disposed of businesses relate to estimated amounts payable in connection with onerous contracts and claims arising from disposals.
The final amount payable remains uncertain as, at the date of approval of these financial statements, there remains a further period during which claims may be received.
The timing of any settlement will depend upon the nature and extent of claims received.
Surplus provisions of 5 million 2010: 16 million were credited to the discontinued operations section of the income statement in the year.
Provisions for onerous contracts represent the liabilities in respect of short-term and long-term leases on unoccupied properties and other contracts lasting under five years.
Provisions for legal and other claims relate principally to provisions for the estimated cost of litigation and other sundry claims.
The timing of the settlement of these claims is uncertain.
Environmental provisions are in respect of potential liabilities relating to the Groups responsibility for maintaining its operating sites in accordance with statutory requirements and the Groups aim to have a low impact on the environment.
These provisions are expected to be utilised as operating sites are disposed of or as environmental matters are resolved.
The other provisions include provisions for restructuring.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
23 Post-employment benefit obligations Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups assets.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group makes employer contributions to the various schemes in existence within the range of 3% to 35% of pensionable salaries.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 58 million 2010: 54 million have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
UK schemes Within the UK there are now two main arrangements following merger of the two defined benefits arrangements: the Compass Group Pension Plan the Plan and the Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme, which took effect from 5 April 2011.
The combined arrangement continues to be known as the Plan.
The other continuing main arrangement is the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP.
CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This has been the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK since that date but existing members of the Plan and the Scheme had continued to accrue benefits under those arrangements up until 5 April 2010.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
Within CRISP a new defined contribution section was established from April 2006 known as the Compass Higher Income Plan CHIP.
Senior employees who contribute to CRISP will receive an additional employer-only contribution into CHIP.
The amount of contribution and eligibility for CHIP are decided annually at the Companys discretion.
The payment towards CHIP may be taken in part, or in whole, as a cash supplement instead of a pension contribution.
The Plan is a defined benefit arrangement.
It has been closed to new entrants since 2003 other than for transfers under public sector contracts where the Group is obliged to provide final salary benefits to transferring employees.
Such transferees enter into the GAD sections of the Plan GAD members.
On 5 April 2010, the Plan and Scheme closed to future accrual for all existing members, other than those within the special sections of the Plan and Scheme for GAD members.
The affected members were offered membership of CRISP from 6 April 2010.
Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2011 101 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2011 23 Post-employment benefit obligations continued The Plan is operated on a pre-funded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Plan is carried out every three years.
The most recent valuations of the Plan and the Scheme were as at 5 April 2010.
The final results revealed a worsening in the funding positions since the previous valuations, although the effects of poor investment returns during the intervening period were lessened by the cautious investment strategy that has been set for these schemes.
Under the funding schedule agreed with the Plan and Scheme Trustees, the Group aimed to eliminate the 5 April 2010 deficit over the eight year period to 30 September 2018.
On merger of the Plan and the Scheme an exceptional advance funding payment of 50 million was made by the Group to the Plan.
A revised funding schedule was agreed with the Plan Trustees whereby the previously agreed combined annual deficit recovery payments will remain unchanged until 30 September 2013.
The target remains to fully eliminate the 5 April 2010 deficit by 30 September 2018.
The next triennial valuation is due to be completed as at 5 April 2013.
The Plan is re-appraised annually by independent actuaries in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requirements.
The other six Trustee Directors are UK-based employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by CRISP members.
The Plan has a Corporate Trustee.
There are a further six Trustee Directors who are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group, three of whom have been nominated by Plan members.
Overseas schemes In the USA, the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The Group has made an exceptional advance funding payment of 10 million to this plan during the year.
In Canada, Norway and Switzerland the Group also participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries, Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
Other than where required by local regulation or statute, the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
For these schemes the current service cost will increase under the projected unit credit method as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of multi-employer union sponsored pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the information provided by the plan administrators is insufficient for them to be accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The Group made total contributions of 8 million in the year 2010: 7 million to these arrangements.
Disclosures showing the assets and liabilities of the schemes are set out below.

The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period.
The actual return on assets was a gain of 61 million 2010: gain of 133 million.
The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was 387 million 2010: 404 million.
An actuarial gain of 17 million 2010: actuarial loss of 57 million was recognised during the year.
Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions, including the discount rate and life expectancy.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the UK discount rate would result in a 138 million decrease or 146 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations, respectively.
An increase or decrease of one year in the life expectancy of all UK members from age 65, would result in a 43 million increase or 42 million decrease in the UK defined benefit obligations, respectively.

When exercised, the holders received a number of shares calculated by reference to the increase in the market price at the time of exercise over the option price as shown in the table above.
Any remaining share appreciation rights are shown in the table above as lapsed.
Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 573.44 pence 2010: 487.67 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.9 years 2010: 5.5 years for executive and management options and 1.4 years 2010: 1.2 years for employee schemes.
In the year, options were granted on 25 November 2010 and 19 May 2011 under the terms of the CSOP 2010.
The estimated fair value of options granted on these dates was 134.75 pence and 151.88 pence respectively.
In 2010, options were granted on 13 May 2010.
The estimated fair value of these options was 159.60 pence.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savingsrelated schemes are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under CSOP 2010: Assumptions options 2011 2010 Expected volatility 35.0% 37.0% Risk free interest rate 2.5% 2.8% Dividend yield 3.3% 2.5% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 584.49p 559.00p Weighted average option exercise price 574.76p 557.50p Vesting of options awarded from October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target.

The comparator group used for the award for the year commencing 1 October 2006 comprised all companies within the FTSE 100 Index, whereas, for subsequent years, only non-financial companies have been included.
This performance condition is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability is built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of LTIP awards made from 1 October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the GFCF target.

Eurest Support Services On 21 October 2005, the Company announced that it had instructed Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to conduct an investigation into the relationships between Eurest Support Services ESS a member of the Group, IHC Services Inc. IHC and the United Nations UN.
Ernst & Young assisted Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this investigation.
On 1 February 2006, it was announced that the investigation had concluded.
The investigation established serious irregularities in connection with contracts awarded to ESS by the UN.
The work undertaken by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Ernst & Young gave no reason to believe that these issues extended beyond a few individuals within ESS to other parts of ESS or the wider Compass Group of companies.
The Group settled all outstanding civil litigation against it in relation to this matter in October 2006, but litigation continues between competitors of ESS, IHC and other parties involved in UN procurement.
IHCs relationship with the UN and ESS was part of a wider investigation into UN procurement activity being conducted by the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, and with which the Group co-operated fully.
The current status of that investigation is uncertain and a matter for the US authorities.
Those investigators could have had access to sources unavailable to the Group, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer or Ernst & Young, and further information may yet emerge which is inconsistent with, or additional to, the findings of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer investigation, which could have an adverse impact on the Group.
The Group has however not been contacted by, or received further requests for information from, the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with these matters since January 2006.
The Group has co-operated fully with the UN throughout.
Other litigation The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the nature of its business and maintains insurance cover to reduce financial risk associated with claims related to these proceedings.
Where appropriate, provisions are made to cover any potential uninsured losses.
Outcome Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, or any claim against the Group related thereto, in the opinion of the Directors, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group.

Key Committee membership Warning about unsolicited investment Membership of the principal Committees of the Board can be contacts found on pages 47 to 49 of this Report.
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
These brokers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
The Financial Services Authority FSA estimates the cost of boiler room fraud in the UK to be 200 million per year.
The FSA receives around 3,500 calls a year from people who have been contacted by boiler rooms.
Around 1,000 of these are victims of boiler rooms and they lose about 20,000 each.
This produces a loss of 20 million that the FSA hears about, but it is estimated that only 10% of victims report the crime.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA website at www.
uk and on the Companys website at www.
Unsolicited mail The Company is legally obliged to make its Register of Members available, subject to a proper purpose test, to the public.
