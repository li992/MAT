Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, which increased revenue by $130.7 million, revenue grew by 9%, of which 5% was organic excluding the impact of exchange rates, fuel prices, acquisitions and disposals.
Acquisitions and disposals contributed $56.5 million of additional net revenue.
Underlying operating profit increased by 16% to $198.9 million 2010: $171.4 million due principally to increased activity across both divisions, the contribution from acquisitions and despite the inclusion in the prior year of a one-off $4.8 million pension curtailment gain.
Reported operating margins were unchanged at 9.3% 2010: 9.3% but improved by 80 basis points on a like-for-like basis after adjusting for the impact of the higher fuel prices and the pension curtailment gain.
The underlying net interest charge amounted to $28.7 million 2010: $23.6 million with the increase due to the higher costs associated with the new bank facility and US private placement from the second quarter, partially offset by the impact of lower average net debt.
20 Directors Report Group Financial Summary Underlying profit before tax increased by 15% to $170.2 million 2010: $147.8 million.
The underlying effective tax rate reduced slightly to 20.3% 2010: 21.2%.
Adjusted earnings per share improved by 6% to 29.0 2010: 27.3 with the growth rate lower than underlying profit before tax as a result of the increased number of shares in issue compared to the prior year.
Profit before tax increased by 24% to $163.6 million 2010: $132.0 million resulting from the improvement in underlying profit before tax as outlined above together with a reduction in pre tax exceptional items to $6.6 million 2010: $15.8 million.
In addition there was an exceptional tax credit of $23.0 million 2010: $0.2 million largely relating to the settlement of an old outstanding tax claim in Germany.
Unadjusted earnings per share increased by 38% to 32.5 2010: 23.6.
Free cash flow of $185.8 million showed a 4% improvement over the prior year 2010: $178.6 million with the working capital outflow experienced in the first half reversing as expected and cash conversion returning to normal levels.
Cash interest payments decreased to $21.5 million 2010: $22.8 million, with the impact of fees associated with the new bank facility and US private placement notes offset by the interest element of the German tax refund.
As a result of the tax refund outlined above there was a net tax inflow of $8.5 million 2010: outflow $4.0 million.
The cash dividend payment in the year amounted to $63.7 million 2010: $25.9 million with the increase a result of the withdrawal of the scrip dividend alternative together with the increased number of shares following the equity share placing in March 2011.
The share placing raised $140.4 million in net proceeds and the new shares were largely allocated to existing shareholders.
In the first half of the year a new diversified and long-term financing structure was implemented, and as expected, the placing proceeds were deployed to fund acquisitions with the total spend on acquisitions in the year amounting to $129.1 million.
In addition, we have spent or committed a further $37 million in capital expenditure to extend key lease terms and deliver additional growth.
Net debt was reduced by $89.2 million to $403.6 million 2010: $492.8 million and net debt to EBITDA was reduced to 1.5x from 2.1x at the end of 2010.
There was a further improvement in Group return on invested capital which increased to 10.6% 2010: 9.5% due to the improved profitability together with continued capital discipline.
