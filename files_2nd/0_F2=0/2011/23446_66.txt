Bondholders may convert their bonds into ordinary shares of the Company from 7 February 2011 up to and including the date falling seven business days prior to 29 December 2017.
The conversion price of 2,050p will be adjusted to deal with certain events which would otherwise dilute the conversion of bondholders.
These events include dividends paid to ordinary shareholders, share rights and share related securities issued to shareholders, issue of other securities to shareholders, demergers and other events detailed in the Prospectus for the Bond.
The Bond, in accordance with IFRS, has been treated as a compound financial instrument that contains both a liability and an equity component.
The economic effect of issuing the instrument is substantially the same as issuing both a debt instrument with an obligation to payment of interest and principal assuming it is not converted and an equity instrument a written call option granting the holder the right for a specified period of time to convert into a fixed number of ordinary shares.
The proceeds from issuing Convertible Bonds are split on Electras balance sheet into its constituent parts of debt and equity in accordance with the requirement of IFRS.
The fair value of the debt element of the bond has been calculated by using a market rate of interest for a similar borrowing that does not include an equity component or a conversion option.
The rate used for these purposes was 9.9%, which, using discounted cash flow, gives a fair value for the debt component of 73.2 million after deducting the pro rata costs of issue of 2.8 million.
The fair value of the equity element is calculated by deducting the fair value of debt from the issue value of the Bond after deducting the pro rata costs of 0.9 million.
Finance costs are taken to the Income Statement and are calculated as the yield to maturity of the fair value of the debt component of the Bond.
On conversion the value of the Bonds converted will be debited to long-term liabilities.
The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued on conversion will be credited to share capital and the balance representing the excess of conversion proceeds over nominal value of the shares will be credited to the share premium account.
