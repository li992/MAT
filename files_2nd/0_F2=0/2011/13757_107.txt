Financial risk factors Financial risk management Overview In the normal course of business, the group is exposed to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note explains the groups exposure to each of the above risks, aided by quantitative disclosures included throughout these consolidated financial statements, and it summarises the policies and processes that are in place to measure and manage the risks arising, including those related to the management of capital.
The directors are ultimately responsible for the establishment and oversight of the groups risk management framework.
An essential part of this framework is the role undertaken by the audit committee of the board, supported by the internal audit function, and by the chief financial officer, who in this regard is supported by the treasury committee and the group treasury function.
Amongst other responsibilities, the audit committee reviews the internal control environment and risk management systems within the group and it reports its activities to the board.
Theboard also receives a quarterly report on treasury activities, including confirmation of compliance with treasury risk management policies.
The group treasury function is responsible for the management of cash, borrowings and the financial risks arising in relation to interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The responsibility for the management of commodities exposures lies with the procurement functions within the group, including Trinity Procurement GmbH Trinity, the groups centralised procurement function.
The transition of risk management of key brewing and packaging materials has now been substantially transferred to Trinity.
Some of the risk management strategies include the use of derivatives, principally in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures contracts, in order to manage the currency, interest rate and commodities exposures arising from the groups operations.
The group also purchases call options where these provide a cost-effective hedging alternative and, where they form part of an option collar strategy, the group also sells put options to reduce or eliminate the cost of purchased options.
It is the policy of the group that notrading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The groups treasury policies are established to identify and analyse the financial risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor exposures and adherence to limits.
Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group is subject to exposure on the translation of the foreign currency denominated net assets of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into the groups US dollar reporting currency.
The group seeks to mitigate this exposure, where cost effective, by borrowing in the same currencies as the functional currencies of its main operating units or by achieving the same effect through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
An approximate nominal value of US$1,836 million of US dollar borrowings and 254 million of euro borrowings have been swapped into currencies that match the currency of the underlying operations of the group, primarily South African rand, but also Peruvian nuevo sol, Czech koruna, Polish zloty, Russian rouble and euro.
Of these financial derivatives, US$1,180 million and 150million are accounted for as net investment hedges.
The group does not hedge currency exposures from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries, associates and jointventures.
The group is also exposed to transactional currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of group entities.
These exposures are presently managed locally by group entities which, subject to regulatory constraints or currency market limitations, hedge a proportion of their foreign currency exposure estimated to arise over a period of up to 18months.
Committed transactional exposures that are certain are hedged fully without limitation in time.
The group principally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge currency risk.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Currency risks arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of amonetary nature.
The group holds foreign currency cash flow hedges totalling US$927 million at 31 March 2011 2010: US$417 million.
The foreign exchange gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in the cash flow hedging reserve until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains and losses are transferred to inventory, property, plant and equipment or to the income statement as appropriate.
The group holds net investment hedges totalling US$1,944 million at 31 March 2011 2010: US$1,751 million.
The foreign exchange gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in the net investment hedging reserve and partially offset the foreign currency translation risk on the groups foreign currency net assets.
ii Interest rate risk As at 31 March 2011, 40% 2010: 34% of consolidated gross borrowings were in fixed rates taking into account interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The groups policy is to borrow directly or synthetically in floating rates, reflecting the fact that floating rates are generally lower than fixed rates in the medium term.
However, a minimum of 25% of consolidated net borrowings is required to be in fixed rates for a minimum duration of 12months and the extent to which group borrowings may be in floating rates is restricted to the lower of 75% of consolidated net borrowings and that amount of net borrowings in floating rates that with a 1% increase in interest rates would increase finance costs by an amount equal to but not more than 1.20% of adjusted EBITDA.
The policy also excludes borrowings arising from recent acquisitions and any inflation-linked debt, where there will be a natural hedge within business operations.
Exposure to movements in interest rates in group borrowings is managed through interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
As at 31 March 2011, on a policy adjusted basis, excluding borrowings from recent acquisitions and any inflation-linked debt, 44% 2010: 47% of consolidated net borrowings were in fixed rates.
The impact of a 1% rise in interest rates on borrowings in floating rates would be equivalent to0.67% 2010: 0.78% of adjusted EBITDA.

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed income instruments Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are measured at their fair value.
As such, all financial instruments with fixed rates of interest that are accounted for at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7.
The group holds derivative contracts with a nominal value of US$2,933 million as at 31 March 2011 2010: US$2,901 million which are designated as fair value hedges.
In the case of these instruments and the underlying fixed rate bonds, changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the hedging instrument attributable to interest rate movements net off almost completely in the income statement in the same period.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments A change of 100 bps in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased other comprehensive income and the income statement by the amounts shown above.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Theanalysis was performed on the same basis for 2010.
