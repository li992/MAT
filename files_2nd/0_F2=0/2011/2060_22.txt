Financial statements 136 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited On 20 December 2007, BG Group ceased to be a United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC registered company and the Groups SEC reporting obligations also ceased with effect from that date.
BG Group continues voluntarily to use the SEC definition of proved reserves toreport proved gas and oil reserves and disclose certain unaudited supplementary information detailed on pages 136 to 142.
BG Group also now uses SEC definitions introduced by the SEC in 2009 for probable reserves.
BG Groups strategy aims to connect competitively priced gas to high-value markets.
Hydrocarbon reserves, and gas in particular, are developed inrelation to the markets that they are intended to supply.
Information in this section is therefore grouped as shown below to reflect the nature ofthe markets supplied by BG Group.

The Head of the Corporate Reserves Group, Dr. Carolina Coll, has more than 24 years experience in the oil and gas industry.
She has a degree in Physics and a PhD in petroleum engineering.
She is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee and a member of the Expert Group on Resource Classification of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
Total additions and revisions to proved reserves during the year were 588 mmboe.
This includes revisions due to new data and field performance updates 400 mmboe increase, extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 236 mmboe increase, acquisitions and disposals 15 mmboe increase and the net effect of price movements 63 mmboe decrease.
Production in the period was 234 mmboe.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.
Changes in gas and oil prices in fields subject to Production Sharing Contracts PSCs may result in changes to entitlements and therefore proved reserves.
PROVED RESERVES BG Group utilises the SEC definition of proved reserves.
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves comprise total proved reserves less total proved developed reserves.
PROBABLE RESERVES BG Group utilises the SEC definition of probable reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, areas likely as not to be recovered.
Probable developed reserves are those reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and with existing equipment and operating methods.
Probable undeveloped reserves comprise total probable reserves less total probable developed reserves.
DISCOVERED RESOURCES Discovered resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate of recoverable hydrocarbons where commercial and or technical maturity issuch that project sanction is not expected within the next three years.
RISKED EXPLORATION Risked exploration resources are defined by BG Group as the best estimate mean value of recoverable hydrocarbons in a prospect multiplied bythechance of success.
TOTAL RESOURCES Total resources are defined by BG Group as the aggregate of proved and probable reserves plus discovered resources and risked exploration.
Totalresources may also be referred to as total reserves and resources.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference tothe Groups estimate of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year and estimates of third-party prices.
Prices foreach year are calculated using a 12-month average price in line with SEC methodology.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cashflowinformation presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
Thedisclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs, which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
