Issue costs amounted to $6,979,000 resulting in net proceeds of $158,021,000.
HOC issued 1,650 $100,000 unsecured convertible bonds at par, which have a maturity of five years and one day and an annual coupon of 8% payable semi-annually on 17 August and 17 February of each year.
Bondholders had the right to convert the Bonds into Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.70 per share at any time.
The number of Ordinary Shares receivable on conversion of the Bonds is fixed.
The Company had the right to redeem, in whole or part, the Bonds for cash at any time on or before 16 February 2008, at 150% of par value.
This right was not exercised.
The fair value of the host liability component of the Bonds net of issue costs was estimated at $140,154,000 on 16 February 2007.
The difference between the $165 million due on maturity and the initial liability component is accreted using the effective interest rate method and is recorded as finance costs.
As the Company call option meant that conversion feature could be settled in cash in accordance with IAS 32 the conversion was treated as a derivative liability.
The fair value of this derivative liability estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $17,867,000 at 16 February 2007 and subsequent gains and losses were recorded in finance income and costs up to the expiry of the Company call option on 17 February 2008.
As a result of the expiry of this option, and hence the cash settlement feature, the Company has reassessed the classification of the conversion option and determined that it qualifies to be treated as equity under IAS 32, being an option to convert a fixed amount of cash for a fixed number of shares.
Therefore, the fair value of the conversion option was reclassified to equity at that date.
Bondholders had a put option requiring the Company to redeem the Bonds at par, plus accrued interest, in the event of a change of control of the Company or revocation or surrender of the Zapadno Chumpasskoye licence in Russia the contingent put option.
In the event of a change of control and redemption of the Bonds or exercise of the conversion rights, a cash payment of up to $19,700 on each Bond will be made to a Bondholder, the amount of which depends upon the date of redemption and market value of shares at the date of any change of control event.
The contingent put option has been valued separately.
The fair value of the contingent put option was estimated fide minimis by the Company at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 fide minimis.
The fair value measurement of the contingent put option is categorised as Level 2.
On 18 December 2009, the Company announced it had entered into a SPA for the sale of the Ugandan Assets note 6.
The Company also announced that it would consider returning a portion of the disposal proceeds to shareholders through a special dividend on completion of the proposed transaction.
Under the terms and conditions of the Bonds, the Company was restricted from making or declaring a dividend or making any other distributions to its shareholders which constitutes on a consolidated basis more than 30% of its earnings for the immediately preceding financial year.
In December 2009, the Company approached Bondholders with the proposal to agree to remove this restriction and to make some other changes in the terms and conditions of the Bonds.
In consideration the Company proposed to pay to those Bondholders who vote on the proposal the sum of $2,000.00 per $100,000 of Bonds held by such Bondholders.
The majority of the Bondholders voted in favour of this proposal at a meeting on 31 December 2009 and the restriction of making or declaring a dividend or making any other distributions to shareholders has been removed.
On 15 January 2010, the Company paid $2,378,000 to the Bondholders who voted.
In accordance with IAS 39, this amendment to the terms and conditions of the Bonds does not constitute a redemption and therefore this amount was offset against the convertible bonds liability and will be recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Convertible bonds mature within a period less than one year from 31 December 2011 and therefore have been reclassified as current liabilities at 31 December 2011.
Convertible bonds were repaid in full in February 2012.
Long-term debt In January 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company received a sterling denominated loan of 4.5 million to refinance the acquisition of a corporate office.
