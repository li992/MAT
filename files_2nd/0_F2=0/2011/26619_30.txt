Man Group plc 69 Annual Report 2011 Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the timings of being able to redeem the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSP based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSP are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to NAVs where the timing of being able to redeem the fund product or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
Fair value heirarchy of financial assets is disclosed in AFI Note 11.
Fee and other receivables $m 2011 2010 Fee receivables 112 52 Prepayments and accrued income 164 119 Other receivables 246 149 522 320 Fee and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds NAV is determined.
All fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances were overdue or delinquent at year end.
Other receivables includes the BlueCrest new loan notes, issued in March 2011, with a par value of $100 million, as part of the consideration received upon disposal of our equity stake Note 18.
The new loan notes, which carry a 6.5% cash coupon, are repayable in 2016, although BlueCrest has the right to repay the new loan notes before this date.
In certain circumstances, the maturity of the new loan notes can be extended by BlueCrest, in which case the coupon may increase, but the final maturity will not be later than April 2019.
Man expects that the new loan notes will be held to maturity and fully repaid.
The balance at 31 March 2010 included the existing loan notes which were redeemed at their par value of $37 million.

70 Man Group plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Review continued 17.
Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the US dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange gain loss of $13 million 2010: $2 million gain loss, with a corresponding impact on equity.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 March 2011, a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $8 million increase $5 million decrease 2010: $14 million increase $9 million decrease in net interest income, with a corresponding impact on equity.
Liquidity and borrowings The business is cash generative at an operating level and it has the ability to generate significant equity and cash through performance fees, particularly from AHL.
Mans strategy is to have a diversified borrowing base combining both funded and unfunded facilities and sourced from financial institution and capital market sources.
Mans liquidity resources, aggregated to $4.8 billion at year end 2010: $5.6 billion comprising: net free cash balances cash and cash equivalents less funded debt of $0.6 billion 2010: $1.5 billion : total debt of $1.8 billion 2010: $1.7 billion, held as cash balances: and an undrawn committed syndicated loan facility of $2.4 billion 2010: $2.4 billion.
The maintenance of funded capacity and liquidity forms part of Mans strategy to manage the franchise risks of the business through different market conditions and business cycles.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
To maintain maximum flexibility none of our credit facilities have any covenants that are linked to maintaining minimum levels of funds under management, financial metrics or credit ratings.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements AFI 18 the funding requirements relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
Where funding is utilised, transactions are evaluated on the economic benefit to the overall franchise and return on the capital deployed.
The mix of funded debt and committed facilities is a matter determined by the Board based on funding needs, availability and funding capacity in the capital and bank markets and therefore can change over time.
The liquidity profile of Man is monitored on a daily basis and the stress scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover the current and stress liquidity requirements.
The following table summarises Mans available liquidity maturity as at 31 March 2011 based on contractual maturity.
