The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28% to 26% on 1 April 2011.
Factors that may affect future tax charges At 30 April 2011 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 2,042,000 2010 nil in respect of taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make suitable taxable revenue profits in excess of deductible expenses in future periods.
The potential deferred tax asset has been calculated using a corporation tax rate of 26%.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
