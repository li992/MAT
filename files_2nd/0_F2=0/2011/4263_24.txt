dollars, with the underlying security held by a US financial institution overseas.
ADRs help to reduce administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction ADS: a US dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock exchange.
American Depositary Shares ADSs are issued by depository banks in the US under agreement with the issuing foreign company: the entire issuance is called an American Depositary Receipt ADR and the individual shares are referred to as ADSs AGPS: assisted GPS: an augmentation to GPS where the mobile phone network can provide the almanac and ephemeris data.
By using the mobile phone network, the GPS receiver does not need to decode data from the satellites, thus both speeding up acquisition of a fix and allowing fixes to be made in areas where GPS signals are too weak to allow decoding of data but are nonetheless strong enough to be used to measure time of arrival see also GPS algorithm: a term describing a formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem android: android is a software platform for mobile devices based on a Linux kernel, initially developed by Google and later the Open Handset Alliance attach rate: represents the rate of adoption of additional products or technologies on to the primary or hosting product baseband: describing that part of a radio telecommunication system in which information is processed before modulating on to, or after demodulating off, a radio frequency RF carrier wave BiCMOS or Bi-polar CMOS: is a process which combines bipolar junction transistors on CMOS technology.
The combination utilises the high speed, high gain and low output characteristics of the bipolar technology with the high density logic gates of the CMOS technology.
It has advantages for RF performance, reduced power consumption and low noise circuits bipolar: bipolar refers to the enhancement of the conduction of current within a transistor that enables the control of a larger electrical current thereby providing an amplified signal billof materials: a list of the individual parts or material which comprise a finished product and the cost of each of those individual parts BlueCore: means the CSR family of single chip CMOS based see below Bluetooth solutions which integrate onto one chip the Radio Frequency RF, baseband and communications protocol stack Bluetooth: is an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices Bluetooth SMART formerly known as Bluetooth low energy or BTLE : is designed to work side-by-side with and complement Bluetooth.

Some popular codecs for computer video include MPEG and Indeo.
In telecommunications it is short for coder decoder, a device that encodes or decodes a signal.
For example, telephone companies use codecs to convert binary signals transmitted on their digital networks to analog signals converted on their analog networks CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 162 Full version AR 290898. pdf 166 14 03 2012 17:20:37 co-exist co-existence: means the ability of two systems to operate in parallel without interfering with the other connectivity: enabling two electronic devices to communicate with each other and transfer data voice audio music picture word files using radio waves Connectivity Centre: a term first promulgated by CSR in its application to wireless connectivity solutions: the Connectivity Centre brings together many aspects of short range wireless connectivity products with excellent co-existence capable of operating concurrently without degradation in optimum performance of each of the individual functions CSP: Chip-Scale Package: a semiconductor package which is as small as the semiconductor chip and is used for small form factor applications such as mobile phones, PDAs and wireless devices design win: CSR records a design win when a product using one of its ICs becomes qualified die: another word for chip: often used to refer to the chips whilst they are still an integral part of the silicon wafer or where they have been cut from the wafer but are, as yet, unpackaged digital: the representation of data by a series of bits or discrete values such as 0s and 1s EGPS: enhanced GPS: as the name suggests an enhancement to GPS whereby measurements are made by the GPS receiver on the signals received from the mobile phone network which allow both fine time and frequency assistance to the GPS receiver.
This further accelerates acquisition of a fix, as well as allowing, when GPS signals are unavailable, fall-back to a fix made solely from the measurements made on the cellular network see also GPS ERPSystem: Enterprise Resource Planning System is a company wide computer software system used to manage and co-ordinate internal and external resources.
