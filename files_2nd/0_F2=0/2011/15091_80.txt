SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 45 11 Audit Committee Report Internal audit The work of internal audit has focused on the areas of greatest risk to SuperGroup Plc, as determined by managements risk identification and assessment processes as validated by the Executive Directors.
The output from this process is summarised in an audit plan which is approved by the Board and Audit Committee, and updated on a regular basis.
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Group Finance Director and the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
In addition to attending two of the Audit Committee meetings, the acting Head of Internal Audit has attended the Executive Leadership team meetings and has reported regularly on internal audit reviews to Executive management during the year.
The key objectives are to provide independent and objective assurance on risks and controls to the Board and senior management and to assist the Board with meeting its corporate governance and regulatory responsibilities.
The role of internal audit and the scope of its work continue to evolve to take account of changes within the Group and emerging best practice.
Non-audit work The policy in respect of non-audit work by the external auditors is that they should not be requested to carry out non-audit services on any activity of the Group where they may, in the future, be required to give an audit opinion.
However, the committee has approved the following exceptions: l the preparation and filing of corporation tax returns, providing these follow the external auditors sign-off of the statutory accounts: l due diligence work associated with business acquisitions: l advice on tax matters in connection with the evolving corporate structure to support the growth of the Group, provided the engagement team is separate to the audit engagement team: and l specific advice on matters such as VAT, and employment taxes, where the engagement team is separate to the audit engagement team, and prior approval has been granted by the committee.
The committee has reviewed and agreed the non-audit services provided by the external auditors, together with the associated fees, and is satisfied that these did not prejudice the external auditors independence.
