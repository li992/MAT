Exillon Energy Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements in 2010, for management purposes depreciation calculated in accordance with russian Accounting Standards RAS was reported to the CODM.
IFRS depreciation is calculated based on the fair value of property, plant and equipment as it was measured in the business combination, while rAS calculations are based on historical costs.
Another principal difference of calculation relates to the usage of the straight-line method for property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas production activities in rAS instead of use of the unit-of-production method used in iFrS.
in 2011, depreciation calculated in accordance with iFrS is used for management purposes and reported to the coDM.
