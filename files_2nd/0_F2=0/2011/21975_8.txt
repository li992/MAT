Retirement benefit plans Background The group has both dened benefit and dened contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK.
The BTPS is a dened benefit plan which has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001.
Subsequent to that date new entrants have been able to join a dened contribution plan, initially the BT Retirement Plan BTRP and since 1 April 2009 the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract-based dened contribution arrangement, to which BTRP members were invited to transfer their accumulated assets.
A dened contribution plan is a pension arrangement under which both the company and participating members pay xed contributions to an independently administered fund.
Pension benets for members of the plan are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the annuity rates at retirement.
The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
A dened benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay.
Benets are determined by the scheme rules and are not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The plan is administered by an independent trustee who is responsible for ensuring that the plan is sufciently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and therefore must agree with the sponsoring company a funding plan for additional company contributions where it is estimated that the benets will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment returns.
The company is exposed to investment and other experience risks.
The membership of the BTPS is shown below: 2011 2010 At 31 March Number of members Number of members Active members 51,000 55,000 Deferred members 88,500 93,000 Pensioners 188,000 185,000 Total membership 327,500 333,000 Since 1 April 2009, active BTPS members accrue benets based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
Pensionable service prior to that date entitles scheme members to benets based upon their final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
On a CARE basis, rather than being based upon final salary, benets are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of ination or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Under the scheme rules pension benets are increased in line with ination see below for details.
BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed of the BTPS, there are nine Trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustee.
Four Trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the Trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the Trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Further details of the governance of the BTPS, its financial position and performance of investments, and a summary of member benets are available in the BTPS Annual Report published by the Trustee in June each year.

b At 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010, the schemes assets did not include any ordinary shares of the company.
However, the scheme held 10m 2010: 52m of bonds and 7m 2010: 6m of index-linked bonds issued by the group.
The group occupies two 2010: four properties owned by the BTPS on which an annual rental of 0.1m is payable 2010: 0.2m.
Expected long term return on assets IAS 19 The expected long-term rate of return on assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets reported in the income statement as a specic item.
The expected returns on xed-interest and index-linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year which assume that the security is held to maturity.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.
Asset allocation The target allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The Trustees main investment objective is to ensure that over the long-term, and after allowing for all future income, the BTPS will have sufficient liquid resources to meet the cost of benefit payments as they fall due.
The targets set reect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
The targets are a long-term aim to be achieved over a period as and when favourable opportunities arise.
Current market conditions and trends are continuously assessed and short-term tactical shifts in asset allocation may be made around the long-term target, for example, by using stock index future contracts.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.

Retirement benefit plans continued The Trustee reports on investment performance against a target benchmark which is based on the target asset mix and the market returns for each asset class.
BTPS performance against the benchmark for the periods to 31 December 2010 was as follows: Target Actual Over under benchmark BTPS Performance Period ending 31 December 2010 return % return % return % 1 year 10.7 11.8 1.1 3 years 0.2 1.1 1.3 10 years 4.1 5.1 1.0 Further commentary on investment performance is provided in the Report by the Trustee in the BTPS Annual Report.
Measurement of scheme liabilities IAS 19 The liabilities of the BTPS are measured as the present value of the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of scheme liabilities is calculated by estimating future benefit payments, including allowance for benets to increase with ination and projected salary levels, and discounting the resulting cash ows.
Principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The estimated average duration of BTPS liabilities is 15 years 2010: 15 years and the benets payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 60 years as shown in the following graph: Forecast benefits payable by the BTPS at 31 March 2011 m 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 2012 2035 2058 2081 2104 The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future ination, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Sensitivities are set out below.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take more or less cash lump sum at retirement.
The rate of ination inuences the assumptions for salary and pension increases.
In assessing the appropriate assumption for pension increases, management have considered the announcement in July 2010 by the UK Government that the Consumer Prices Index CPI, rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI, will be used as the basis for determining the rate of ination for the statutory minimum rate of revaluation and indexation of occupational pension rights.
Under the scheme rules the Governments decision has the following impact with effect for increases after 1 April 2011: members who commenced employment prior to 1 April 1986 CPI will be used to revalue preserved pensions of deferred members and for the rate of inationary increase applied to pensions in payment members who commenced employment on or after 1 April 1986 CPI will be used to revalue preserved pensions of deferred members and RPI will continue to be used for inationary increases to pensions in payment.
The Governments decision does not affect the accrual of benets for employees while they are active members of the scheme for whom benets accrue on a CARE basis that is linked to RPI.
The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term xed interest and index-linked Government bonds and has regard to Bank of England published inationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account long-term trends.
The impact of using CPI instead of RPI is to reduce BTPS liabilities at 31 March 2011 by 3.5bn.
In determining the most appropriate manner by which to reect the impact of the change on the scheme liabilities, the directors have had regard to the UITF Abstract 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the Retail Prices Index with the Consumer Prices Index for retirement benets issued by the Urgent Issues Task Force of the UK Accounting Standards Board in December 2010.
The Abstract states that, where the obligation is to pay pensions with increases based on a general measure of ination rather than a measure linked specically to RPI, a change in the ination assumption represents an actuarial gain or loss rather than a cost relating to past service of employees.
Accordingly, the gain on re-measurement of the liabilities of the BTPS to reect CPI as the ination measure is recorded as an actuarial gain in comprehensive income in 2011.

Retirement benefit plans continued The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 at 31 March 2011 are as follows: Nominal rates per annum Real rates per annum 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 At 31 March % %% % %% Rate used to discount liabilities 5.50 5.50 6.85 2.03 1.83 3.84 Ination increase in RPI 3.40 3.60 2.90 n a n a n a a Ination increase in CPI 2.40 n a n a n a n a n a Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.40 3.60 2.90 a There is a short-term reduction in CPI of 0.5% for one year.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate has been assessed by reference to the duration of the BTPSs liabilities and by reference to the published iBoxx index of Sterling corporate bonds of duration greater than 15 years and investment grade AA and above.
Allowance is made where the constituent bonds in the published index have been re-rated or new issues made.
The nominal rate is used to discount the future expected benefit payments.
The real rate is shown as a comparator to ination.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: 2011 2010 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 25.3 25.2 Male in higher pay bracket 27.6 27.4 Female 28.2 28.1 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.1 1.1 The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the life expectancy assumptions adopted to take into account the actual membership experience.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience every three years.
The IAS 19 life expectancy assumptions reect the 2008 triennial funding valuation basis.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumed discount rate, ination, salary increases and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation of the pension liability, and of the income statement charge for 2012, to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Decrease Decrease increase in increase in increase in net finance liability service cost income bn m m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.4 15 ination rate RPI 0.5 15 45 salary increases 0.2 5 15 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 1.0 5 55 0.1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets 35 74 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 07A U10648 Notes to the Con Financial Statements.

This includes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and non-financial assumptions such as life expectancy.
Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments on the dened benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared to the assumptions made.
Such differences might arise, for example, from actual salary increases being different from those assumed, or members choosing different benefit options at retirement.
Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustment on plan assets represents the difference between the actual investment performance in the year and expected rate of return on assets assumed at the start of the year.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The funding valuation is based on prudent assumptions and is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the scheme.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The last two triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Nominal rates per annum Real rates per annum 2008 2005 2008 2005 valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%% Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 6.76 5.84 3.65 3.06 Post retirement liabilities 5.21 4.54 2.15 1.79 Average long-term increase in retail price index 3.00 2.70 Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.00 3.47 0.75 Average increase in pensions 3.00 2.70 The results of the two most recent triennial valuations based upon these prudent actuarial assumptions were: 2008 2005 Valuation Valuation At 31 December bn bn BTPS liabilities 40.2 37.8 Market value of BTPS assets 31.2 34.4 Funding deficit 9.0 3.4 Percentage of accrued benets covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 77.6% 90.9% Percentage of members benets that the BTPS assets could purchase from an insurance company at the valuation date 57.0% 70.0% In the three years ended 31 December 2008, the decline in the market value of assets combined with longer life expectancy assumptions signicantly increased the funding deficit, although the impact on the liabilities was reduced by the higher discount rate and favourable experience compared to other actuarial assumptions used at 31 December 2005.
The outcome of the 2008 valuation was announced in February 2010, together with the agreement between BT and the Trustee of the BTPS to a recovery plan to make good the 9.0bn funding deficit over 17 years.
The agreement also determined that the ordinary contributions rate required to meet the benets of current employed members for service after the valuation date reduce to 13.6% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 19.5%, reecting the implementation of benefit changes with effect from 1 April 2009.
The group made the first two payments of 525m each in December 2009 and 2010, respectively, under the 17-year recovery plan and in March 2011 paid 505m representing the actuarial value of the 525m payment due to have been made in December 2011.
The remaining payments are scheduled to be paid as follows: Year ended 31 December m 2011 2012 583 2013-25 Increasing at 3% pa Under the terms of the Trust Deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
Other features of the February 2010 legal agreements with the Trustee for BT providing support to the scheme are: in the event that cumulative shareholder distributions exceed cumulative total pension contributions over the three year period to 31 December 2011, then BT will make additional matching contributions to the scheme.
in the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals and acquisitions in any 12-month period to 31 December 2011 then BT will make additional contributions to the scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
a negative pledge that provides comfort to the scheme that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold.
Since the valuation date the schemes assets have increased by 5.8bn and the Trustees initial estimate is that if the funding valuation was performed using the same methodology at 31 December 2010 the deficit would have been around 3.2bn on this prudent valuation basis, after allowing for the 0.5bn deficit payment made in March 2011.
The Pensions Regulators review of the 2008 BTPS funding valuation and recovery plan is now on hold and is not expected to recommence until the outcome of final Court decision, including any potential appeals, is known on the Crown Guarantee.
We do not expect this to be before the completion of the next triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2011.
As is usual, BT and the Trustee will engage with the Pensions Regulator regarding the 2011 valuation.

Retirement benefit plans continued Payments made to the BTPS 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March m m Ordinary contributions 266 384 deficit contributions 1,030 525 Total contributions in the year 1,296 909 The group expects to contribute approximately 135m to the BTPS in 2012, being ordinary contributions only, as the deficit payment duein December 2011 was paid early in March 2011.
The expected payments are reduced by 110m to recover overpayments of ordinary contributions paid in 2010 before the reduced rate of regular contributions was announced in February 2010.
Other protection of BTPS member benets If the group were to become insolvent, there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and which applies upon the winding up of the group.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that cover by the Crown Guarantee is not limited to those who were members of the scheme at the date of privatisation and that members who joined after privatisation are also capable of being covered, The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
It was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT if the member concerned had not previously been employed by BT.
The judgment was the first stage in the case and leaves further issues to be considered at future hearings and or appeals.
Until these issues are nally resolved it is not possible to say with complete precision what the scope of the Crown Guarantee is.
the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.

At 31 March 2011, all of the deferred tax asset of 461m 2010: 2,196m is expected to be recovered after more than one year.
At 31 March 2011, all of the deferred tax liability of 1,212m 2010: 1,456m is expected to be settled after more than one year.
The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 28% to 26% on 1 April 2011.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2011 have been calculated using a rate of 26%.
The impact of the change of rate decreased deferred tax assets by 35m and deferred tax liabilities by 91m totalling a reduction in net liabilities of 56m.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 172m in the income statement note 11 and a deferred tax expense of 116m in other comprehensive income.
The UK Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The future corporation tax reductions of 1% are expected to have a similar impact on the groups financial statements, as outlined above, however the actual impact will depend on the groups deferred tax position at that time.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 77 07A U10648 Notes to the Con Financial Statements.
Deferred taxation continued At 31 March 2011, the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 23.5bn 2010: 29.5bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2011 At 31 March m Expiry of losses Restricted losses: Americas 254 2012-31 Europe 1,492 2012-26 Asia 14 2012-16 Total restricted losses 1,760 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 3,440 No expiry Capital losses 17,771 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 21,211 Other temporary differences 536 Total 23,507 At 31 March 2011, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 5.3bn 2010: 5.5bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.

Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial instruments by category The accounting classication of each class of the groups financial assets and liabilities is set out in the tables below.

Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Funding and exposure management The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits and long-term and short-term borrowing.
The group borrows in the major long-term bond markets in major currencies and typically, but not exclusively, these markets provide the most cost effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses forward currency contracts to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from funding its overseas operations, acquisitions, overseas assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
80 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 07A U10648 Notes to the Con Financial Statements.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising from transactions with financial institutions.
This treasury operation also manages the groups market exposures, including risks from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury operation acts as a central bank to group entities providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage financial risk at optimum cost.
Treasury policy The BT Group plc Board sets the policy for the groups treasury operation.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowing and investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these polices to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director of the BT Group plc Board.
The financial risk management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply these policies and procedures and perform review processes to assess and manage financial risk exposures arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2011 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy The group has interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The Boards policy, as prescribed by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at xed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate mix prole, the group has entered into cross currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Outstanding cross currency and interest rate swaps at 31 March 2011 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives section below.
The groups fixed to floating interest rate profile, after hedging, on gross borrowings was: 2011 2010 Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate interest interest Total interest interest Total At 31 March m m m m m m a Total borrowings 7,972 1,246 9,218 10,110 1,082 11,192 Ratio of xed to oating 86% 14% 100% 90% 10% 100% a See note 20.
Sensitivities Interest rates The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on derivatives that are not in hedging relationships and on variable rate borrowing and investments which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of balance sheet financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 March 2011, a 100 basis point increase in Sterling interest rates would decrease the groups annual net finance expense by approximately 184m 2010: 194m.
The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest rate exposure to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, before tax, as detailed below: 2011 2010 m m At 31 March Reduce Increase Reduce Increase Sterling interest rates 426 496 US Dollar interest rates 355 392 Euro interest rates 94 134 A 100 basis points decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Credit ratings The groups 2030 and 2016 bonds contain a covenant such that if the BT Group plc groups credit rating were downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next coupon period at a rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each agency.
Based on the total debt outstanding of 2.4bn at 31 March 2011, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BT Group plc groups credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups 600m 2014 bond attracts an additional 1.25 percentage points for a downgrade by one credit rating by either or both Moodys and S&P below Baa3 BBB, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of approximately 7m a year.
As at 31 March the groups credit ratings were as detailed below: 2011 2010 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating Agency Standard & Poors BBBPositive BBBStable Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Negative Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management dened the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management to take positions of up to 100m and for the Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups current revenue is invoiced in Sterling, and a significant element of its operations and costs arise within the UK.
The groups overseas operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
The groups foreign currency borrowing comprised: 2011 2010 At 31 March m m Euro 3,366 4,298 US Dollar 2,966 5,066 Other 17 29 6,349 9,393 These borrowings are used to finance the groups operations and have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross currency swaps.
The currency prole of these borrowings after the impact of hedging is disclosed in note 20.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.
Sensitivities After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies would result in a credit charge respectively of approximately 5m 2010: approximately 26m.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity would be insignicant in both 2011 and 2010.
Outstanding cross currency swaps at 31 March 2011 are detailed in the Hedging activities and Other derivatives sections below.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Credit risk management Treasury management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading related receivables.
For treasury related balances, the BT Group plc Boards dened policy, restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and S&P and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Association ISDA documentation.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The treasury operation regularly reviews the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions and continues to monitor their credit quality and actively manage any exposures which arise.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2011 2010 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 21 733 1,700 Investments 15 19,339 19,133 a Trade and other receivables 19 2,590 2,961 Cash and cash equivalents 16 354 1,441 Total 23,016 25,235 a The carrying amount excludes 286m 2010: 336m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non financial assets, and 774m 2010: 749m of repayments and other receivables.
The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments excluding amounts owed by parent and ultimate parent companies and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of the Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.

The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 19, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business and reflects the nature of customers in each line of business.
The derivative financial assets were held with 14 counterparties at 31 March 2011 2010: 18 counterparties.
After applying the legal right of set-off under the groups ISDA documentation, the group had a net exposure to derivative counterparties of 549m 2010: 1,303m.
Of this, 94% 2010: 85% was with six counterparties 2010: six.
The group has credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby on a weekly basis the fair value position on nominal 800m of a long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
As at 31 March 2011, the group had paid cash collateral of 14m 2010: nil in respect of fair value losses and had received cash collateral of 104m 2010: nil in respect of fair value gains.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within cash and cash equivalents, and loans and borrowings, respectively.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The majority of the groups derivatives are in designated cash ow hedges.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of net derivative financial assets at 31 March 2011, a 100 basis point shift in yield curves across each of the ratings categories within which these derivative financial assets are classied would change their carrying values and impact equity, before tax, as follows: Impact of 100 basis Impact of 100 basis point increase point decrease At 31 March 2011 m m Moodys S&P credit rating Aa2 AA 4 5 Aa3 AA- 15 20 A1 A 75 88 A2 A 101 120 195 233 The group also has credit exposure arising on amounts owed by its parent and ultimate parent companies, with the majority of this balance being owed by the parent company.
The related party disclosures detailed in note 5 provide details of how this loan has arisen.
The loan owed by the parent company is primarily supported by the parent companys investment in British Telecommunications plc.
Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection, when appropriate, taking into consideration the groups exposure to the customer, by applying processes which include netting and offsetting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading related financial assets.
Capital risk management The objective of BT Group plcs capital management policy is to reduce debt over time whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, BT Group plc may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
BT Group plc manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The BT Group plc Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to the groups objectives and processes during 2011 and 2010.
The BT Group plc groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The following analysis summarises the components which are managed as capital by BT Group plc: 2011 2010 At 31 March m m BT Group plc consolidated net debt 8,816 9,283 Ultimate parent shareholders equity deficit 1,925 2,650 10,741 6,633 Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
During 2011 and 2010 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
In March 2011 the group signed a committed borrowing facility of 1.5bn, available for the period to March 2016.
The committed facility replaces the 1.5bn January 2013 and 650m May 2012 facilities.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
In December 2010, the groups US Dollar 9.375% bond matured with a principal of US$2.88bn 1.74bn at swapped rates and in February 2011, a Euro 7.87% bond matured with a principal of 1.12bn 0.76bn at swapped rates.
Both bond maturities were nanced through existing cash equivalents and investments which had been built up in anticipation of these maturities.
The maturity prole of the groups term debt at 31 March 2011 is disclosed in note 20.
The group has no term debt maturities until the 2013 financial year.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Price risk The group has limited exposure to price risk.
Hedging activities Our hedging policies use derivative financial instruments to manage financial risk.
Derivatives that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as dened in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of xed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the life of the hedged item.
Cash ow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash ows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates and or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are transacted, and where they qualify, designated as cash ow hedges to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on designated cash ow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash ow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash ows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting they are designated as cash ow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in equity, are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.

Other derivatives Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
At 31 March 2011 the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts became ineffective on first time adoption of IFRS.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their fair value movements.
The table below summarises these derivatives at 31 March 2011 and 2010.

Fair value of financial instruments The table below discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to their fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2011 and 2010.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the groups bonds, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the groups outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts were the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.

Financial commitments and contingent liabilities Capital expenditure contracted for at the balance sheet date but not yet incurred was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Property, plant and equipment 467 368 Computer software 15 Total 467 383 Future minimum operating lease payments for the group were as follows: 2011 2010 m m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2011 494 2012 464 460 2013 440 431 2014 413 400 2015 383 375 2016 373 367 Thereafter 5,119 5,160 Total future minimum operating lease payments 7,192 7,687 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in a prior period.
Leases have an average term of 21 years 2010: 22 years and rentals are xed for an average of 21 years 2010: 22 years.
At 31 March 2011, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefonica UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$128m as at 31 March 2011 2010: US$132m, approximately 80m 2010: 87m, although this could increase by a further US$268m 2010: US$304m, approximately 167m 2010: 200m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefonica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
We do not believe that there is any single current court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
During 2011 the aggregate volume and value of legal actions to which the group is party has remained broadly the same as at the end of 2010, during which the levels had increased signicantly.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK Government set the rates payable on BTs infrastructure and those paid by KCOM, and whether or not the UK Government complied with EU rules on state aid.
The Commissions decision in October 2006 that no state aid had been granted was appealed.
In January 2011, the appeal was rejected as inadmissable.
