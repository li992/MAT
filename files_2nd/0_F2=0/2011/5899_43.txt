Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

The Groups principal loan covenants are: interest cover underlying operating profit being at least 2 times and EBITDA being at least 3 times the net interest charge : and net debt to EBITDA ratio net debt being less than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
At 31 August 2011, the Group comfortably complied with its loan covenants.
Interest cover was 8.2 times 2010: 5.3 times for underlying operating profit and 9.9 times 2010: 7.0 times for EBITDA whilst net debt to reported EBITDA was 0.9 times 2010: 1.5 times.
In addition, for compliance with loan covenants, reported EBITDA is adjusted for, inter alia, acquisitions and non-cash items, therefore the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is lower when adjusted for these items.
