88 easyJet plc Notes to the accounts Annual report and accounts 2011 Continued 18 Share incentive schemes continued The fair value of grants under the discretionary and sharesave is estimated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model using the following key assumptions.
The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant.
Exercise price for the discretionary schemes was determined using a five-day weighted average price.
For the Sharesave scheme, exercise price is set at a 20% discount from share price.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option.
Levels of early exercises and forfeitures are estimated using historical averages.
The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted under the share incentive plan during the year was 3.81 2010: 4.15.
