Dividends The quarterly dividend expected to be paid on 30 March 2012 in respect of the fourth quarter 2011 is 8 cents per ordinary share $0.48 per American Depositary Share ADS.
The corresponding amount in sterling will be announced on 19 March 2012.
A scrip dividend alternative is available, allowing shareholders to elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares and ADS holders in the form of new ADSs.
On 1 February 2011 BP announced the resumption of quarterly dividend payments with a fourth-quarter 2010 dividend of 7 cents per share.
The resumption came after the suspension of dividends for the first three quarters of 2010 in light of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and commitments to fund the $20-billion Trust.
The details of the scrip dividends issued are shown in the table below.

Earnings per ordinary share Cents per share 2011 2010 2009 Basic earnings per share 135.93 19.81 88.49 Diluted earnings per share 134.29 19.81 87.54 Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes treasury shares and the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts ESOPs and includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share plans.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease the loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
