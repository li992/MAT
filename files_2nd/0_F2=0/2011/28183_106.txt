When shares are disposed of a capital gain may result if the disposal proceeds exceed the sum of the base cost of the shares sold and any other allowable deductions such as share dealing costs.
The exercise of subscription shares or warrants into ordinary shares should not have given rise to a capital gain, however a capital gain may arise on the eventual disposal of those shares.
The calculations required to compute capital gains may be complex and depend on personal circumstances.
Shareholders are advised to consult their personal financial advisor for further information regarding a possible tax liability in respect of their shareholdings.
