Employment cost continued SHARe-BASeD PAYMenTS ReSTRICTeD SHAReS AnD PARTICIPATIOn In CO-InveSTMenT PLAn The company operates restricted share schemes for directors and management, as well as participation in a Co-Investment Plan for directors.
Restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 The restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 were subject to a market performance condition being the companys relative TSR performance over three years against the HSBC Global Gold index.
This has been assessed and has a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the share price on the grant date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period has a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.
Restricted shares issued to management Restricted shares issued to management are subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
All employees and directors to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The performance period is typically up to five years where the employee must remain in employment for the shares to vest.
There are no market based vesting conditions on the 2011 share awards.
The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the share price on the grant day date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
An amount of US$1.6 million 2010: nil was capitalised to development projects during the year, as it related to share-based payment shares for employees involved in these projects.
Restricted share awards granted to executive directors in 2011 The restricted share scheme operates with conditional share awards, where the awards shall vest in three equal one-third instalments.
If the performance conditions are met, awards vest to participants at the end of each performance period.
The whole award is subject to four mutually exclusive performance conditions, ie absolute TSR market based, EPS growth, additional reserves and absolute reserves.
Refer to the Remuneration Report on pages 125 to 139 for more detail.
46 577 of restricted shares were awarded on 13 June 2011 and were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The shares have been fair valued at US$2.7 million.
The following assumptions were used in the valuation model: risk free rate of 0.59%, 0.98% and 1.37% were used for each performance period: historical share price volatility of 40% was used: the correlation used between the HSBC Global Gold Index and the company TSR was 80% over the last 3 years: and performance period from over 3, 4 and 5 years, with a further 1 year post-vesting retention requirement.
