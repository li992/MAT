114 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTE 10 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill.
During the financial year, the remaining carrying amount of goodwill for Japan was reduced to nil through the recognition of an impairment loss of 55m 2010 131m.
This has been included in cost of sales in the Group Income Statement.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 8% to 14% 2010 6% to 14%.
On a post-tax basis, the discount rates ranged from 6% to 12% 2010 4% to 13%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates of 2% to 5% 2010 1% to 4%.
In February 2011 and 2010 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The components of goodwill are as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK 645 645 Tesco Bank 802 802 Thailand 161 157 South Korea 468 489 Japan 55 China 582 594 Malaysia 83 77 Poland 401 424 Czech Republic 34 35 Turkey 50 54 US 78 Other 12 5 3,316 3,337 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 115
